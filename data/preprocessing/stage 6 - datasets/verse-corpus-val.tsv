Then the chief priests and the elders among the people gathered in the courtyard of the chref priest, whose name was Caiaphas,	Tá i hére airimor ar i amyárar imíca i lie ocomner i pacasse i héra airimóva, yeo esse náne Caiafas,

In the same moment that they left the boat, a man having an unclean spirit met them, coming from the tombs.	Mí imya lú ya hehtanes i lunte, nér arwa úpoica faireo velle se, túlala i noirillon.
And he was changed before them, and his face shone like the sun, and his clothes were radiant as light.	Ar anes vistana epe te, ar cendelerya caltane ve Anar, ar lanneryar náner alcarinque ve cala.

But behold! a man called Jairus came, and he was the chief of the synagogue.

And the tongue is a fire! The tongue is a world of unrighteousness among our body-parts, for it defiles the entire body and kindles the wheel of life, and it is kindled by Gehenna.

Therefore I say to you: Do not be troubled about yourselves, about what you will eat or what you will drink, or about your bodies, concerning the clothers you will wear.

For this is the love for God, that we abide by his commandments. And his commandments are not burdensome,	An si ná i melme Eruva, i himyalve axanyar. Ar axanyar umir lumne,
Then the chief priest asked Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching.	Tá i héra airimo maquente Yésunna pa hildoryar ar pa peantierya.
Jesus turned towards them and said: “Daughters of Jerusalem, do not be wailing for me! Be wailing for yourselves and for your children, for behold! days are coming in which people will say: 'Happy are the women without fruit, and the wombs that did not conceive and he nipples that did not suckle!'

But when they still did not believe, for the joy and for the wonder, he said to them: “Are you having here thing to eat?”	Mal íre en ualte sáve, i alassenen ar i elmendanen, quentes téna: “Ma sámalde sisse nat matien?”
For his invisible true-being is easily seen from the creation of the world, for they are being perceived by the things made, also his eternal power and divinity. Therefore they cannot defend themselves,	An úcénima nasserya ná aşcénima i ontiello mardeva, an nalte tuntaine i cárine natinen, yú oira túrerya ar valasserya. Etta ualte pole varya inte,

For he commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. Beforehand the demon for a long time kept the man fast, and he was bound by chains and by bonds on his feet, while guards watched him, but he tore over the bonds and was driven by the demon into the lonely places.

But Jesus said: “Let her be! What is your reason for making things difficult for her? a good deed she has done for me.	Mal Yésus quente: “Lava sen náve! Mana castalda carien nati urde sen? Mára carda acáries nin.

It is also necessary that there exist splits among you, in order to show who among you are trusty.	Yú mauya in ear şancier mici le, tanien man mici le nar sarte.
Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to the disciples, saying:	Tá Yésus carampe i şangannar ar i hildonnar, quétala:
Furthermore, if the first portion is hallowed, then the whole dough is holy. And if the root is holy, so are the branches.	Ente, qui i minya massa airinta ná, tá i quanda maxe aire ná. Ar qui i şundo aire ná, sie nar i olvar.
But we think it is proper to hear from you what your thoughts are, for indeed we know about this sect that in every place one speaks against it.”	Mal sanalme i vanima ná hlare lyello mana sanwelyar nar, an é istalme pa heren sina i mi ilya nóme mo quete ana sa.”
And if I have the gift of speaking as a prophet, and I know all the secrets and all knowledge, and if I have faith to command mountains to move, but I do not have love, I am nothing.
