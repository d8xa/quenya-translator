Jesus said to her: “Your brother will rise.”	Eque senna Yésus: “Hánolya ortuva.”
And after he sent the crowds away, he went up into the mountain to a lonely place, to pray. When evening came, he was alone there.	Ar apa mentanes i şangar oa, lendes ama mir i oron eressea nómenna, hyamien. Íre şinye túle, anes erinqua tasse.

But one told him: “Your mother and your brothers are standing on the outside, wishing to see you.”	Mal mo nyarne sen: “Amillelya ar hánoldar tárar i ettesse, mérala vele lye.”
Having gone into the tomb they saw a young man sit on the right, having a white long-tunic , and they were startled.	Méniéla mir i noire cennelte nessa nér háma i foryasse, arwa ninque andalaupeo, ar anelte captaine.

Then he touched their eyes, saying: “May it happen to you as you believe!”	Tá appanes henduttat, quétala: “Nai martuva lent ve saviste!”
They had some quarrels with him about their own worship of the deity, and about a person called Jesus, who is dead, but who Paul said is alive.	Sámelte costeli óse pa véra tyerielta i ainova, ar pa quén estaina Yésus, ye qualina ná, mal ye Paulo quente ná coirea.
After these things there wsa a festival of Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.	Apa nati sine enge aşar Yúraron, ar Yésus lende amba Yerúsalemenna.

Just as the Lord has portioned out to all, so may everyone walk as God has called him. Thus I command in all the congregations.	Aqua ve i Heru etasátie ilquenen, sie nai ilquen vanta ve Eru aiálie se. Sie canin ilye i ocombessen.
But when they went through the cities, they commanded them to keep the statutes fixed by the apostles and elders that were in Jerusalem.	Mal íre lendette ter i ostor, cannette tien hepe i namnar tulcane lo i aposteli ar amyárar i enger Yerúsalemesse.

It was not written about him alone that that was counted to him,	Úne técina pa sé erinqua i ta náne nótina sen,
What, then, if you will see the Son of Man ascend to where he was before?	Mana, tá, qui cenuvalde i Atanyondo ortea yanna enges yá?

But some of the discipes from Jerusalem also went with us, to bring us to the man in whose house we were going to dwell: Mnason, who was of the first disciples.	Mal ennoli i hildoron Yerúsalemello yú lender aselme, talien me i nerenna yeva coasse marumnelme: Mnason, ye náne i minye hildoron.
For when we were in the flesh, the lusts of sin which were being strirred by the Law worked in our body-parts, causing us to bear fruit to death.	An íre anelve i hrávesse, úcareo mailer yar náner valtaine i Şanyenen móler hroarantalvassen, vi-tyarila cole yáve qualmen.
But go down and follow them, and do not be uncertain about anything, for I have sent them.”	Mal mena undu ar áte hilya, ar áva na iltanca pa aiqua, an inye ementaye te.”

Therefore they said to the blind man again: “What do you say about him, since he opened your eyes?” The man said: “He is a prophet.”	Etta quentelte i lomba nerenna ata: “Mana elye quete pa se, pan latyanes hendulyat?” I nér quente: “Náse Erutercáno.”
If I had not done among them the deeds that nobody else has done, they did not have sin; but now they have seen and they have looked at both me and my Father.	Qui uan acárie mici te i cardar yar úquen hyana acárie, ualte sáme úcare; mal sí ecénielte ar eyétielte yúyo ní ar Atarinya.
But the cultivators took his servants, and one they beat up, another they slew, on another they threw stones until he died.	Mal i alamor namper núroryar, ar er palpanelte, exe nacantelte, exenna hantelte sarni tenna qualles.
The chief priests and the Pharisees had commanded that if anyone knew where he was, he was to tell, that they would be able to seize him.	I hére airimor ar i Farisar náner cánienwe i qui aiquen sinte yasse enges, nyarumnes, i polumnelte mapa se.

And bringing Peter and the two sons of Zebedee with himself, he began to have grief and to be troubled.	Ar tálala Péter ar i yondo atta Severaio as inse, yestanes same naire ar náve tarastaina.
For we do not dare to count ourselves among those that speak well of themselves, or compare ourselves with them. When they are their own measure, and compare themselves with themselves, they are not wise.	An ualme verya note imme imíca i quetir mai pa inte, hya sesta imme as té. Íre nalte véra lestalta, ar sestar inte as inte, ualte saile.
But if that evil slave will say in his heart: 'My lord is late',	Mal qui tana ulca mól quetuva endaryasse: 'Herunya ná telwa',
And Jesus said: “Who was that touched me?” When all denied it, Peter said: “Teacher, the crowds lie heavily on you and are pressing against you.”	Ar eque Yésus: “Man náne ye appane ni?” Íre illi laquenter sa, Péter quente: “Peantar, i şangar lumnar lyen ar nírar lyenna.”

But the chief priest and that were with him, the order of the Sadducees that existed then, arose and were filled with envy,	Mal i héra airimo ar i enger óse, i heren Sanducearon ya enge tá, oronter ar náner quátine hrúcennen,

Therefore do not fear; you are more precious than many sparrows.	Etta áva ruce; nalde mirwe epe rimbe filici.
But if there is not anyone to give the meaning, it is necessary for him to be silent in the congreation and speak to himself and to God.	Mal qui lá ea aiquen antáven i teale, mauya sen náve quilda i ocombesse ar quete insenna ar Erunna.
Since he said this thing, there was a dispute between Pharisees and Sadducees, and the multitude was split.	Pan quentes nat sina, enge cos imbi Farisar ar Sanducear, ar i liyúme náne şanca.

And behold! the entire city went out to meet Jesus, and after seeing him, they urged him to go away from their regions.	Ar yé! i quanda osto etelende velien Yésus, ar apa cenie se, hortaneltes auta ménaltallon.
And we know that the Son of God has come, and he has given us understanding to know him who is true, and we are in who is true, by his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life.

But who comes in through the door is shepherd of the sheep.	Mal ye tule minna ter i fenna ná mavar i mámaron.
Did this joy come to circumcised alone, or also to people that are not circumcised? For we say: “To Abraham his faith was counted as righteousness.”	Ma alasse sina túle rie oscarinnar, hya yú queninnar i uar oscirne? An quetilve: “Avrahámen savierya náne nótina ve failie.”
And let two or three prophets give their words, and let the others judge what they are saying.	Ar lava Erutercánoin atta hya nelde anta quettaltar, ar lava i exin name ya quétalte.
I do not do a single thng by self; as I hear I judge, and my judgement is just, for I do not seek my own will, but the will of who sent me.	Uan pole care erya nat immonen; ve hlarin namin, ar námienya faila ná, an uan cesta véra şelmanya, mal i şelma yeo mentane ni.
But after he thought this, behold! the Lord's angel came to him in a dream, saying: “Joseph son of David, do not be afraid of taking Mary your wife to your house, for which is conceived in her is by the Holy Spirit.	Mal apa sannes sin, yé! i Heruo vala túle senna oloresse, quétala: “Yósef Lavirion, áva ruce mapiello María verilya coalyanna, an ya ná nostana sesse i Aire Feanen ná.

to Timothy , beloved child: Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.	Timoşeonna, melda hína: Lisse, oravie ar raine ho Eru i Atar ar Hristo Yésus Herulva.
Let us not seek empty glory, stirring one another up, having envy one towards the other.	Ávalve cesta cumna alcar, valtala quén i exe, arwe hrúceno quén i exenna.
For from God Father he received honor and glory, when words like this were carried to him by the Majestic Glory: «This is my son, my beloved, of whom I have thought well.»	An Eru Atarello camnes laitie ar alcar, íre síti quettali náner cóline senna lo i Meletya Alcar: «Si ná yondonya, meldanya, pa ye inye asánie mai.»
Indeed also Herod did not , for he sent him back to us, and behold! nothing worthy of death has been done by him.	É yando Herol láne, an se-nanwentanes venna, ar yé! munta valda qualmeo anaie carna lo se.
They are a picture of coming things. For these women are two covenants. The first is from Mount Sinai, which bears children into thralldom, and which is Hagar.	Tai nar emma túlala nation. An nissi sine nar vére atta. I minya ná ho Oron Sínai, ya cole híni mólienna, ar ya ná Háhar.
But by God's promise he did not falter in lack of faith, but he was made mighty by his faith,	Mal Eruo vandanen uas talante peniesse saviéva, mal náne carna taura savieryanen,
and also father of circumcized ones, not only to those that adhere to circumcision, but also to those that follow Abraham our father in the path of faith in which he walked before he was circumcised.	ar yú atar oscirnaron, lá rie in himyar oscirie, mal yú in hilyar Avraham atarelva i tiesse saviéno yasse vantanes nó anes oscirna.
Therefore, since one cannot deny that, you will do well if you are still and do nothing without thought.	Etta, pan mo ua pole láquete ta, caruvalde mai qui nalde quilde ar carir munta pen sanwe.
I know that you always hear me, but for the good of the crowd that is standing here I spoke, that they will believe that you sent me.”	Inye ista i illume hlarityen, mal i márien i şango ya tára sís carampen, i savuvalte i tyé mentane ni.”
they that have the fathers and from whom the Christ has his descent by the flesh. May God, who is above all, be blessed forever! Amen!	té i samir i atari ar illon i Hristo same ontalerya i hrávenen. Nai Eru, ye or illi ea, nauva aistana tennoio! Násie!
and after flaying him they will kill him, but on the third day he will rise.”	ar apa riptie se nahtuvaltes, mal i neldea auresse ortuvas.”
if we are faithful, we will also rule with him; if he deny him, he will also deny us;	qui nalve voronde, yando turuvalve óse: qui lalalves, sé yando laluva vé,
For you know, brothers, how our coming to you was not for nothing.	An elde istar, hánor, manen tulielma lenna úne muntan.
When a strong man, having weapons, protects his own court, his goods are in peace.	Íre polda nér, arwa carmaron, varya véra pacarya, armaryar nar rainesse.
He found grace before God and requested that he would give Jacob's God a place for dwelling.	Hirnes lisse epe Eru ar arcane in isse antauva Yácovo Ainon nóme marien.
Thus will not be anyone who fornicates or anyone unholy, like Esau, who in exchange for a single meal gave away his right as firstborn.	Sie ua euva aiquen ye úpuhta hya aiquen úaire, ve Ésau, ye quaptalesse erya matten antane oa minnónierya.
"But encourage one another, every day while there is still that which one calls ""today"", to stop anyone among you from being made hard by the temptation of sin."	"Mal á horta quén i exe, ilya auresse íre en ea ya mo esta ""síra"", pustien aiquen mici le návello carna sarda i úşahtiénen úcareo."
You are sons of the prophets and of the covenant that God established with your fathers, saying to Abraham: 'And in your seed all the families of earth will be blessed.'	Elde nar yondor i Erutercánoron ar i véreo ya Eru tulcane as atarildar, quétala Avrahamenna: 'Ar erdelyasse ilye i nossi cemeno nauvar aistane.'
And to the angel of the congregation in Laodicea write: Thus says the Amen, the faithful and true Witness, Beginning of creation of God:	Ar i valanna i ocombeo Laoriceasse teca: Sin quete i Násie, i voronda ar şanda Vetto, i Yesta ontiéno Eruo:
But when they had sailed around twenty-five or thirty furlongs, they saw Jesus walk on the sea and come near to the boat, and they were afraid.	Mal íre anelte círienwe os restandier lempe yúquean hya nelequean, cennelte Yésus vantea i earesse ar túla hare i luntenna, ar runcelte.
How is beneficial, my brothers, if a person says that he has faith, but he does not have acts? Surely the faith cannot save him?	Manen ná aºea, hánonyar, qui quén quete i samis savie, mal uas same cardar? Lau i savie pole rehta se?
To the body, the lamp is your eye. When your eye is in health, your entire body is also bright, but when it is evil, your body is also dark.	I hroan, i calma ná hendelya. Íre heldenya ná málesse, quanda hroalya ná yando calima, mal íre nas olca, hroalya ná yando morna.
But he, perceiving their hypocrisy, said to them: “What is your reason for testing me? Bring me a denarius, for me to see it!”	Mal sé, tuntala imnetyalelta, quente téna: “Mana castalda tyastien ni? Á tala ninna lenár, cenienyan sa!”
But Jesus spoke firmly to it, saying: “Be silent, and come out of him!”	Mal Yésus carampe tulcave senna, quétala: “Na quilda, ar ettula sello!”
I am the living bread that comes down from heaven; if anybody eats of this bread he will be alive forever. And the bread that I will give is my flesh for the life of the world.”	Inye ná i coirea massa ya tule undu menello; qui aiquen mate sina masso nauvas coirea tennoio. Ar i massa ya inye antuva ná hrávenya i mardo coivien.”
In the same manner also a Levite, when he came down to the place and saw him, passed by away from him.	Mí imya lé yando Levíon, íre túles undu i nómenna ar cenne se, langane oa sello.
"For who said: ""Do not fornicate!"", also said: ""Do not kill!"" If you do not fornicate, but you do kill, you have broken the Law."	"An ye quente: ""Ávalye úpuhta!"", yando quente: ""Áva nahta!"" Qui ual úpuhta, mal é nahtal, aráciel i ªanye."

But Jesus said to him: “Foxes have holes and the birds of heaven have nests, but the Son of Man does not have a place where he may put his head!”	Mal Yésus quente senna: “Rusqui samir eccar ar menelo aiwi samir haustar, mal i Atanyondo ua same nóme yasse lertas panya carya!”
and every unjust temptation of the ones that will be destroyed , since they did not receive the love of truth, for them to be saved.	ar ilya úfaila úşahtiénen i nancaruvainaiva, pan ualte camne i melme nanwiéva, náveltan rehtaine.
Anyone who does God's will, (s)he is my brother and my sister and my mother.”	Aiquen ye care Eruo indóme, sé hánonya ar néşanya ar amillinya ná.”
For Sadducces say that is not resurrection or angel or spirit, but the Pharisees openly believe all these things.	An Sanducear quetir i lá ea enortave hya vala hya faire, mal i Farisar pantave savir ilye nati sine.
But with many words he spoke firmly to them, to stop them from making him known.	Mal rimbe quettalínen carampes tulcave téna, pustien te cariello se sinwa.
And the huge city was split into three parts, and the cities of the nations collapsed. God recalled Babylon the Great, and he gave her the cup of the anger of his wrath.	Ar i hoa osto náne hyárina mir rantar nelde, ar atalanter i ostor i nóríva. Eru enyalde Vável Túra, ar sen-antanes i yulma i limpeo i ormeva rúşeryava.
For “who knew the Lord's mind, and who instucted him?”	An “man sinte i Héruo sáma, hya man peantane issen?”
And in the night Paul received a vision: A man from Macedonia stood requesting of him, saying: “Come over into Macedonia and help us!”	Ar i lómisse Paulo camne maur: Nér Maceroniallo tarne arcala sello, quétala: “Tula olla mir Maceronia ar áme manya!”
Therefore you have need to subject yourselves under the authority, not only by reason of the wrath, but also by reason of your conscience.	Etta samilde maure panien inde nu i hére, lá rie castanen i rúşeo, mal yú castanen immotuntieldo.
for the Lord himself will come down from heaven with a cry, with the voice of a chief angel and having the trumpet of God, and the dead ones in Christ will rise first.	an i Heru inse tuluva undu menello as yello, as i óma héra valo ar arwa i hyólo Eruo, ar i qualinar Hristosse ortuvar minyave.
Therefore I did not count myself worthy to come to you. But say the word and cause my slave to be healed.	Etta únen note imne valda tulien lyenna. Mal queta i quetta ar tyara mólinya náve nestaina.
You fathers, do not cause your children grief, or you will take away their courage.	A atari, áva tyare hínaldain nyére, hya mapuvalde oa huorelta.
Therefore they began to talk among themselves about who among them was that was going to do this thing.	Etta yestanelte carpa mici inte pa man mici te náne ye carumne nat sina.
And now, how is it that you are waiting? Rise, be baptized and wash your sins away by calling on his name.	Ar sí, manen ná i hópal? Á orta, na sumbana ar sova úcarilyar oa yaliénen esseryanen.'
But the other disciples came in the boat – for they were not far from land, only around a hundred yards – drawing the net of fishes.	Mal i hyane hildor túler i luntenen – an úmelte haire nórello, er os rangar tuxa – túcala i rembe lingwion.
For if these things do not exist in a person, he is blind or short-sighted, and has slipped from his recall how he was cleansed from his sins long ago.	An qui nati sine uar ea mi quén, náse cénelóra hya ºintacénea, ar ataltie enyalieryallo manen anes poitaina úcareryallon andanéya.
and put that before the feet of the apostles. Then one distributed to everyone was their need was.	ar panyaner ta epe i apostelion talu. Tá mo etsate ilquenen ve maurelta náne.
For whenever non-Jews that do not have law by nature do that the law says, these people, though they do not have law, are a law to themselves.	An quiquie Úyúrar i uar same şanye nassenen carir yar i şanye quete, queni sine, ómu ualte same şanye, nar şanye inten.
Because of these things God's wrath comes upon the people that break his orders.	Sine natinen Eruo rúşe tule i queninnar i racir canwaryar.
from the beginning when John was baptizing and until the day when he was received up from us. For a person among them it is necessary to be a witness with us about his resurrection.”	i yestallo íre Yoháno sumbeáne ar tenna i aure yasse anes cámina ama vello. Quenen mici té mauya náve astarmo aselve pa enortierya.”
But Jesus said to his disciples: “Truly I say to you that it will be difficult for a rich person to come into the kingdom of heaven.	Mal Yésus quente hildoryannar: “Násie quétan lenna in urda nauva lára quenen tule mir menelo aranie.
When Jesus passed along from there, two blind men followed him, crying and saying: “Have mercy on us, Son of David!”	Íre Yésus lahtane talo, laceníte nér atta hilyanet se, yámala ar quétala: “Órava metse, Lavirion!”
But he started to curse and to give his oath: “I do not know this man that you are talking about!”	Mal sé yestane húta ar antane vandarya: “Uan ista nér sina pa ye elde quétar!”
See my hands and my feet, that it is I; touch me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you are seeing that I have.”	Cena mányat ar talunyat, i inye ná; áni appa ar cena, an faire ua same hráve yo axor ve cénalde i inye same.”
And I saw an angel standing in the Sun, and he cried in a mighty voice and said to all birds who fly in the midst of heaven: “Come, gather for God’s great feast,	Ar cennen vala tárala Anaresse, ar yámes taura ómanen ar quente ilye aiwennar i vilir menelo endesse: “Tula, ócoma Eruo túra merendenna,
for you to be renewed in the spirit of your mind	náveldan envinyante i fairesse sámaldo
and where he goes inside say to the master of the house: The Teacher says: Where is my guest-room, where I can eat the Passover with my disciples?”	ar yasse menis minna queta i coanturenna: I Peantar quete: Masse aşalşambenya, yasse ece nin mate i Lahtie as hildonyar?”
They are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of earth.	Tú nát i milpialda atta ar i calmatarma atta yar tarir epe i Heru cemeno.
But the storm lay extremely heavy upon us, and on the following day they threw the goods into the sea,	Mal i raumo ita lumnane men, ar i hilyala auresse hantelte i armar mir i ear,
They were slain with stones, they were tested, they were sawn into peaces, they died being slain with swords, they covered themselves with skins of sheep and goats, while they were in need, in tribulation, suffering evil behavior.	Anelte nance sarnelínen, anelte tyastaine, anelte saraine mir rantali, quallelte nála nance macillínen, tompeltexer helmalínen mámaron ar nyéniron, íre anelte mauresse, şangiesse, perpérala ulca lengie.
For nobody does anything secretly if he seeks to be known.	An úquen care aiqua nuldave qui cestas náve sinwa. Qui caritye nati sine, á apanta immo i marden!”
They fixed a day when they were going to see him and came to where he lived, more numerous than they were the first time. From morning to evening he told and witnessed to them about God's kingdom, and from the Law and from the prophets he tried to give them understanding about Jesus.	Tancelte aure yasse velumneltes ar túler yanna marnes, rimbe lá ya anelte mí minya lú. Arinello şinyenna nyarnes ar vettanes tien pa Eruo aranie, ar i Şanyello ar i Erutercánollon néves anta tien hande pa Yésus.
But I say: Walk by spirit, and you will by no means follow the desire of the flesh!	Mal quetin: Á vanta fairenen, ar laume hilyuvalde i hráveo íre!
Do not let anyone take away your crown of victory who has his joy in “lowliness” and worship of angels. His thoughts are fixed on the things that he has seen in vision, and he praises himself without reason, by his fleshly mind.	Áva lave aiquenen mapa oa ríelda apaireva ye same alasserya mi “naldie” ar tyerme valaiva. Sanweryar nar tácine i natissen yar ecénies mi maur, ar laitas inse ú casto, sámaryanen hráveva.
You husbands, dwell with your wives with understanding, giving them glory as to a weaker vessel, the feminine, since you are also heirs with them to the grace of life – or your prayers will be hindered.	A veruvi, mara as verildar handenen, antala tien alcar ve ambe milya venen, i inya, pan nalde yando aryoni aselte i Erulisseo coiviéva – hya hyamieldar nauvar hampe.
One of the dciples, Andrew the brother of Simon Peter, said to him: “ is here a small boy having five breads of barley and two fishes. But what are they for so many people?”	Quén i hildoron, Andréas i háno Símon Pétero, quente senna: “Ea sís pitya seldo arwa massaron findoriva lempe ar hala atto. Mal mana tai ta rimbe quenin?”
And for this purpose Christ died and came back to life: to be Lord of dead ones and of living ones alike.	An sina ennen Hristo qualle ar nanwenne coivienna: náven Heru qualinaron ar coirearon véla.
That is the smallest of all seeds, but having grown it is the biggest of the vegetables and has been made a tree, and so heaven's birds came and find rest in its branches!”	Ta ná i ampitya ilye erdion, mal álienwa náse i anhoa i quearon ar anaie carna alda, ar sie menelo aiwi tulir ar hirir sére olvaryassen!”
– also on my behalf, for me to receive words when I open my mouth, allowing me with boldness to make known the secret of the gospel,	– yando rá inyen, camienyan quettar íre pantan antonya, lávala nin veriénen care sinwa i evandilyono fóle,
But who has become one with the Lord is one spirit with him.	Mal ye olólie er as i Heru faire er ná óse.
Then they went back to prepare spices and fragrant oils. But they rested on the sabbath, according to the commandment.	Tá nanwennelte manwien tyávelasseli ar níşime milloli. Mal sendelte i sendaresse, i axannen.
And recalling it, Peter said to him: “Rabbi ,behold! The fig tree that you cursed is withered up.”	Ar enyálala sa, Péter quente senna: “Rappi, ela! I relyávalda ye huntel hestiéla ná.”
For the word of promise was thus: “At this time I shall return, and will be a son with Sarah.”	An i quetta vando sie né: “Lúme sinasse nanwenuvan, ar euva yondo as Sara.”
Wishing that, surely I was not too free? Or the things that I make my goal, did I wish to do them in the manner of the flesh, and so was with me 'Yes, Yes' and 'No, no'?	Mérala ta, lau anen acca léra? Hya i nati yar carin mehtinya, ma mernen caritat mi lé i hráveo, ar sie enger asinye 'Ná, Ná' ar 'Ui, ui'?
After him Judas from Galilee arose, in the days in which the people was counted, and he drew away some people after himself. And yet that man died, and all that heeded his commands were scattered.	Apa sé Yúras Alileallo oronte, mí rí yassen i lie náne nótina, ar tunces oa queneli apa inse. Ananta sana nér qualle, ar illi i cimner canwaryar náner vintane.
There were occasions when you were openly given to mockeries and tribulations alike, and on some occasions you had a part with others that went through such things.	Enger lúli yassen anelde pantave antaine yaiwelin ar şangiélin véla, ar lúlissen sámelde ranta as exeli i lender ter síti nati.
When the day came, the council of elders of the people, the chief priests and the scribes alike, assembled. And they drew him before their council, saying:	Íre i aure túle, i ocombe amyáraron i lieo, i hére airimor ar i parmangolmor véla, ocomner. Ar tunceltes epe ocombelta, quétala:
Furthermore, he has still more profound feelings towards you when he recalls how you heeded his commands, how you received him in fear and trembling.	Ente, samis en ambe tumne felmeli lenna íre enyalis manen cimnelde canwaryar, manen camneldes ruciesse ar paliesse.
May you have grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,	Nai samuvalde lisse ar raine ho Eru Atarelva ar i Heru Yésus Hristo,
And when they came to the other disciples, they saw a great crowd around them, and scrubes quarrelling with them.	Ar íre túlelte i hyane hildonnar, cennelte hoa şanga os te, ar parmangolmoli costala aselte.
But Jesus said to Peter: “Put your sword in the sheath! The cup that the Father has given me, am I really not to drink it?”	Mal Yésus quente Péterenna: “Á panya macilelya i vainesse! I yulma ya i Atar ánie nin, lau sucuvanyes?”
“I say to you: Rise, take your stretcher, and go to your house!”	“Quetin lyenna: Á orta, mapa colmalya, ar mena coalyanna!”
so reminding the young women that it is necessary for them to love their husbands, love their children,	sie rentala i nesse nissi i mauya tien mele verultar, mele hínaltar,
 is necessary for us to do the work of who sent me while is day; the night is coming when nobody can work.	Mauya ven care i molie yeo ni-mentane íre ea aure; i lóme túla yasse úquen pole mole.
Thereafter, when he lay by the table in the house, behold! many tax collectors and sinners came and lay there with Jesus and his disciples.	Epeta, íre caines ara i sarno i coasse, yé! rimbe tungwemóli ar úcarindoli túler ar cainer tasse as Yésus ar hildoryar.
For if you give praise by spirit, how will the man that is sitting in the place of the ordinary person say “amen” when you give thanks, since he does not understand what you are saying?	An qui antalde laitale fairenen, manen i nér ye hára i şanya queno nómesse quetuva “násie” íre antalde hantale, pan uas hanya mana quétalde?
But when the disciples surrounded him, he arose and went into the city. And on the following day he went away with Barnabas, going to Derbe.	Mal íre i hildor pelder se, orontes ar menne mir i osto. Ar i hilyala auresse oantes as Varnavas, lelyala Lervenna.
Now the congregation in all of Judea and Galilee had peace and was being built up, and while they walked in fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, their number rose.	Sí i ocombe mi quanda Yúrea ar Alilea sáme raine ar náne carastaina ama, ar lan vantanelte ruciesse i Herullo ar mí Aire Feo tiutale, nótelta oronte.
But when he saw the woman, Jesus called her to himself and said: “Woman, you are freed from the illness making you weak.”	Mal íre cennes i nís, Yésus yalle se insenna ar quente: “Nís, nalye leryaina i hlívello lye-cárala milya.”
Therefore be awake, recalling how through three years, at night and at day, I did not stop instructing you with tears.	Etta na coive, enyalila manen ter loar nelde, lómisse yo auresse, uan pustane peanta len nírelínen.
having all lowliness of mind and a mild manner, suffering one another with love,	arwe quanda naldiéno sámo ar milya léo, perpérala quén i exe melmenen,
And you know and have believed the love that God has for us. God is love, and who remains in love remains in God, and God remains in him.	Ar elve istar ar asávier i melme ya Eru same elveva. Eru ná melme, ar ye lemya melmesse lemya Erusse, ar Eru lemya sesse.
To do so was indeed good in their eyes, and yet they were debtors to them, for if the nations have a part in their matters of spirit, they also owe to be servants for them with matters of the flesh.	Care sie é náne mára mi hendulta, ananta anelte rohtandor tien, an qui i nóri samir ranta mi nattoltar faireva, yú rohtalte náve núror tien nattoinen i hráveo.
But when Paul's sister's son heard that they were lying hidden to kill him, he went to him, and when he came to the camp he told it to him.	Mal íre Paulo néşo yondo hlasse i caitumnelte nurtane nahtien se, lendes senna, ar íre túles i estolienna sa-nyarnes sen.
Furthermore, brother shall give brother over to death, and a father a child, and children shall rise against parents and cause their death,	Ente, háno antuva háno olla qualmenna, ar atar hína, ar híni ortuvar nostarunna ar tyaruva qualmetta,
For David says concerning him: 'I always saw the Lord before my eyes, for he is by my right hand, to stop me from being shaken.	An Lavir quete pa sé: 'Illume cennen i Héru epe hendunyat, an náse ara formanya, ni-pustien návello pálina.
When they still spoke about these things, Jesus himself stood in their midst and said to them: “May you have peace!”	Íre en quentelte pa nati sine, Yésus immo tarne endeltasse ar quente téna: “Nai samuvalde raine!”
By him we have the ransom by his blood: the forgiveness of our sins, by the riches of his grace.	Sénen samilve i nanwere serceryanen: i apsenie úcarilvaiva, lisseryo larnen.
But the chief of the synagogue, being angry since Jesus healed on the day of rest, said to the crowd: “There are six days in which it is necessary to work. There come on them to be healed, and not on the day of rest!”	Mal i turco i yomencavo, nála rúşea pan Yésus nestane i sendaresse, quente i şanganna: “Ear auri enque yassen mauya mole! Etta tula mi tai náven nestaina, ar lá i sendaresse!”
The anger between them was so sharp that it caused them to abandon one another, and Barnabas took Mark and sailed away to Cyprus.	I rúşe imbe tu náne ta aica i tyarneset hehta quén i exe, ar Varnavas nampe Marco ar cirne oa Ciprusenna.
I indeed thought that it was necessary for me to stand against the name of Jesus Christ from Nazareth in numerous manners,	Inye é sanne i mauyane nin tare ana i esse Yésus Hristova Násaretello mi rimbe léli,
and I will ask of the Father, and he will give you another helper that will be with you forever,	ar inye arcuva i Atarello, ar antuvas len hyana şámo ya euva aselde tennoio,
But he said to them: “What is your reason for seeking me? Did you not know that it is necessary for me to be in the house of my Father?”	Mal quentes túna: “Mana castasta cestien ni? Ma uaste sinte i mauya nin náve i coasse Atarinyava?”
furthermore, for the wailing to be as if they were not wailing, and for that have joy as if they lacked joy, and for that trade to be as those that do not possess,	ente, i yaimeain náve ve au únelte yaimie, ar in samir alasse náve ve au pennelte alasse, ar in mancar ve i uar harya,
Therefore, my brothers, be faithful, firm – always doing an abundance in the work of the Lord, knowing that your work is not for nothing in the Lord.	Etta, hánonyar, na voronde, tulce – illume carila úve mí Heruo molie, istala i molielda ua muntan i Herusse.
My children, keep yourselves from idols!	Hinyar, hepa inde cordonillon!
What is born by flesh is flesh, and what is born by spirit is spirit.	Ya ná nóna hrávenen hráve ná, ar ya ná nóna fairenen faire ná.
But as is written: “ that eye has not seen and ear has not heard, that a man's heart did not think, those God has prepared for that love him.”	Mal ve ná técina: “Yar hen ua ecénie ar hlas ua ahlárie, yar atano enda ua sanne, tai Eru amanwie in melir se.”
To the One who can keep you firm by the gospel that I brought and by making known Jesus Christ, by the revelation of the mystery that has been kept in silence for eternities,	Yen pole hepe le tulce i evandilyonnen ya tallen ar cariénen sinwa Yésus Hristo, i apantiénen i fóleva ya anaie hépina quildesse ter oireli,
