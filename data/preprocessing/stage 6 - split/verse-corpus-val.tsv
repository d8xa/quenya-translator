Therefore, we that are ready, let us have this matter in mind, and if you have another thing in your thoughts, God will reveal to you also this matter.	Etta, elve i nar manwe, alve same natto sina sámasse; ar qui samilde hyana nat sanweldassen, Eru apantuva len yando natto sina.

and if the house is worthy, may the peace that you wish for it come upon it, but if it is not worthy, may the peace from you return to you.	ar qui i coa valda ná, nai i raine ya merilde san tuluva sanna, mal qui uas valda, nai i raine lello nanwenuva lenna.

Thus Jesus, when he came, found that Lazarus had already been lying four days in the grave.	Sie Yésus, íre túles, hirne i Lasarus nollo náne caitienwa auressen canta i noirisse.
For we were saved in this hope; but a hope that one sees is not hope, for when a person sees a thing, how does he have hope for it?	An anelve rehtane estel sinasse; mal estel ya mo cene ua estel, an íre quén cene nat, manen samis estel san?
For seems to me that God has put us, the apostles, last, as men condemned to death, for we have been a spectacle to the world, and to angels, and to men.	An neme nin in Eru apánie mé, i aposteli, métime, ve neri námine qualmen, an anaielme ettanáve i marden, ar valain, ar atanin.
The second angel sounded his trumpet, and a thing like a great mountain, burning with fire, was thrown into sea;	I attea vala lamyane hyólarya, ar nat ve hoa oron, uryala narnen, náne hátina mir ear;

On the first day of the week, when we were assembled to break bread, Paul talked to them, since he was going away on the following day, and he was speaking until the middle of the night.

And they did so and made them all lie down.	Ar carnelte sie ar tyarne te illi caita undu.
For if by will we sin after receiving the knowledge of the truth, no longer remains a sacrifice concerning sins.	An qui nirmenen úcarilve apa camie i istya i nanwiéva, ua ambe lemya yanca pa úcari.
We know that anyone born of God does not sin, but the One who was born of God abides by him, and the Wicked One does not touch him.	Istalve i aiquen nóna Eruo ua úcare, mal i Quén ye náne nóna Eruo himya se, ar i Olca ua appa se.

You did not choose me, but I chose you, and I have appointed you to go out and to bear fruit, and your fruit will remain, that the Father will give you what you pray for in my name.

Ar i minya óma ya hlassen quéta óni náne ve i lamma hyólo, ar eques: “Tula ama sir, ar lyen-tanuvan yar ron martuvar.”
And since the Law has a shadow of the coming good things, but not the full picture of the things, the sacrifices sacrificed from year to year cannot make perfect who bring them.	An pan i Şanye same leo i túlala mánaron, mal lá i quanta emma i nation, i yancar yácine loallo loanna uar pole care ilvane i talar tai.
Circumcized on the eighth day, born into Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews, concerning the Law: a Pharisee,	Oscirna i toltea auresse, nóna mir Israel, Venyamíno nosseo, Heverya Heveryalion, pa i Şanye: Farisa,

Therefore, seeing that we are God's kin, we do not do well if we think about the Deity that he is like gold or silver or stone, or an artifact formed by man's art or thought.
