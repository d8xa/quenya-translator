And anyone that does not take his cross and follows me is not worthy of me.	Ar aiquen ye ua mapa tarwerya ar hilya ni ua valda nin.
Therefore, do not be troubled about the following day, for the following day will have its own troubles. Every day's evil suffices for it.	Etta, áva na tarastaine pa i hilyala aure, an i hilyala aure samuva vére tarastieryar. Ilya réo ulco farya san.
But thanks be to God: You were thralls of sin, but you sincerely heeded the kind of instruction to which you were given over.	Mal na hantale Erun: Anelde móli úcareo, mal cimnelde holmo i nostale peantiéva yan anelde antane olla.
But Jesus turned and saw them follow, and he said to them: “What are you seeking?” They said to him: “Rabbi” – which means teacher – “where are you staying?”	Mal Yésus querne immo ar cenne tú hilyea, ar quentes túna: “Mana cesteaste?” Tú quentet senna: “Ravi” – ya tea Peantar – “masse máral?”

But when he was asked by the Pharisees about the time when God's kingdom was going to come, he said to them in answer: “God's kingdom does not come in a manner allowing people to see it with their eyes.
