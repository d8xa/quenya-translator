ENGLISH	QUENYA
Paul, called to be Jesus Christ's apostle through God's will, and Sosthenes our brother,	Paulo, yálina náven Yésus Hristo apostel ter Eruo indóme, ar Sostenes hánolma,
to God's congregation which is in Corith – to you that have been hallowed in Jesus Christ, called to be holy, with all that in every place are calling upon the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ, their Lord and our Lord.	Eruo ocombenna ya ea Corintesse – lenna i anaier airinte mi Hristo Yésus, yáline náven airi, as illi i ilya nómesse yálar i essenen Herulvo, Yésus Hristo, Herulta ar Herulma.
May you have grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.	Nai samuvalde lisse ar raine ho Eru Atarelva yo i Heru Yésus Hristo.
I always give thanks to God for you, about God's greace given you in Jesus Christ,	Illume antan hantale Erun len, pa Eruo lisse antana len mi Hristo Yésus,
that in everything you have been made rich by him, in every word and knowledge,	i mi ilqua anaielde cárine lárie lo sé, ilya quettasse ar istyasse,
since the witness of the Christ has been made firm among you.	pan i Hristo vettie anaie carna tanca mici le.
Thus you do not lack a single gift, waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ.	Sie ualde pene erya anna, hopila i apantien Herulva Yésus Hristova.
He will also make you firm until the end, for you to be perfect on the day of Jesus Christ our Lord.	Isse yú caruva le tance tenna i metta, náveldan ilvane Yésus Hristo Herulvo auresse.
God is faithful, by whom you were called to have a part with his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.	Eru voronda ná, lo ye anelde yáline samien ranta as Yondorya, Yésus Hristo Herulva.
Now I urge you, brothers, in the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, that all among you will say the same thing, and that will not be divisions among you, but that you will be one in the same mind and the same thought.	Sí le-hortan, hánor, Yésus Hristo Herulvo essenen, in illi mici le quetuvar i imya nat, ar in uar euva şancier mici le, mal i nalde er mí imya sáma ar i imya sanwe.
For was told me about you, brothers, by the people from the house of Chloe, that there are quarrels among you.	An náne nyárina nin pa le, hánor, lo i queni coaryallo Hloe, i ear costier mici le.
I am talking about this thing, that everyone among you says: “I am for Paul“, “but I for Cephas“, “but I for Christ“.	Quétan pa nat sina, in ilquen mici le quete: “Inye ná Paulon”, “mal inye Céfan”, “mal inye Hriston”.
The Christ is split. Surely Paul was not crucified for you? Or were you baptized in Paul's name?	I Hristo şanca ná. Lau Paulo náne tarwestana len? Hya ma anelde sumbane Paulo essenen?
I give thanks that I did not baptize any among you expect Crispus and Gaius.	Antan hantale i uan sumbane aiquen mici le hequa Hrispo ar Aio.
Then you will not say that you were baptized in my name.	Tá ualde quetuva i anelde sumbane ninya essenen.
Indeed I baptized also the family of Stephanas. Of the others I do not know that I baptized anyone.	É sumbanen yú nosserya Stefánas. Pa i exi uan ista i sumbanen aiquen.
For Christ sent me, not to baptize, but to make known the gospel, not with wisdom of speech, causing the cross of Christ to lack its power.	An Hristo ni-mentane, lá sumbien, mal carien sinwa i evandilyon, lá questo sailiénen, tyarila i Hristo tarwe pene túrerya.
For speech of the cross is foolishness to that that will be lost, but to us that are saved it is God's power.	An questa i tarweo úhandie ná in nauvar vanwe, mal ven i nar rehtane nas Eruo túre.
For is written: “I will cause the wisdom of the wise ones to pass away, and the intelligence of the intelligent ones I will put away.“	An ná técina: “Tyaruvan i sailaron sailie auta, ar i handaron handasse panyuvan oa.”
Where the wise one? Where is the scribe? Where who loves word-strife in this world? Has God not made the world's wisdom foolish?	Masse i saila quén? Masse i parmangolmo? Masse ye mele quetta-cos mar sinasse? Ma Eru ua acárie i mardo sailie úhanda?
For since, in God's wisdom, the world by its own wisdom did not know God, it was good in God's eyes that he would save that believe by the foolishness that we make known.	An pan, Eruo sailiesse, i mar véra sailieryanen ua sinte Eru, náne mára Eruo hendusse i rehtumnes i savir i úhandiénen ya carilme sinwa.
For Jews ask for signs and Greeks seek wisdom,	An Yúrar arcar tanwar ar Hellenyar cestar sailie,
but we make known Christ crucified – which turns Jews away and is foolishness to the non-Jews.	mal elme carir sinwa Hristo tarwestana – ya quere Yúrar oa ar úhandie ná i Úyúrain.
But to those that are called, to Jews and Greeks alike, he is Christ, God's power and God's wisdom.	Mal in nar i yálinar, Yúrain ar Hellenyain véla, náse Hristo, Eruo túre ar Eruo sailie.
For the foolish thing of God is wiser than men, and a weak thing of God is stronger than Men.	An i úhanda nat Eruo ná saila lá Atani, ar milya nat Eruo ná polda lá Atani.
For you behold his calling of you, brothers: that not numerous ones that were wise in the manner of the flesh were called, not numerous mighty ones, not numerous ones born as nobles.	An yétalde yalierya eldeva, hánor: i lá rimbar i náner saile mí hráveo lé náner yáline, lá rimbe taurar, lá rimbar nóne ve arator.
But God chose the foolish things of the world, humbling the wise ones; and God chose the world's weak things, humbling the strong ones,	Mal Eru cilde i mardo úhande nati, nucumila i sailar; ar Eru cilde i mardo milye nati, nucumila i toryar,
and God chose the ignoble ones and that were being despised – them that are nothing – to destroy them that seem important.	ar Eru cilde i mardo úartar ar i náner nattíraine – té i nar munta – nancarien té i nemir valde.
Thus will not be flesh that will praise itself before God.	Sie ua euva hráve ya laituvaxe epe Eru.
But by him you are in Christ Jesus, who has been made God's wisdom to us, and righteousness and sanctification and ransom.	Mal issenen nalde mi Hristo Yésus, ye anaie carna ven sailie Erullo, ar failie ar airitáve ar nanwere.
Thus, as has been written, ' that praises himself, may be praise himself in the Lord!'	Sie, ve anaie técina, 'Ye laitaxe, nai laituvas inse i Hérusse.'
For I, when I came to you, brothers, did not come with beautiful words or wisdom when I made God's mystery known.	Ar inye, íre túlen lenna, hánor, ua túle arwa vanye quettaron hya sailiéno íre carnen Eruo fóle sinwa len.
For I made the choice that I did not want to know a single thing among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified.	An carnen i cilme in uan merne ista erya nat imíca le hequa Yésus Hristo ar sé tarwestana.
For I can to you being weak and in fear and in great trembling,	Ar túlen lenna nála milya ar cauresse ar túra papiesse,
and my speech and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in a showing of spirit and power.	ar questanya ar sinwacarienya úner mirquetila quettassen sailiéno, mal tanávesse faireva ar túreva.
Thus your faith could be established, not on men's wisdom, but on God's power.	Sie ence savieldan náve tulcana, lá to atanion sailie, mal to Eruo túre.
Now we speak wisdom about those that are mature, but not the wisdom of this age, or that of who rule in this age – that will be undone.	Sí quetilme sailie imíca i nar marine, mal lá randa sino sailie, hya ta ion turir mi randa sina – i nauvar nancarne.
But we speak God's wisdom in a mystery, the hidden wisdom, which God established beforehand before the ages, for our glory.	Mal quetilme Eruo sailie fólesse, i nurtana sailie, ya Eru tulcane nóvo nó i randar, alcarelvan.
This wisdom no one of that rule in this age has known, for if they knew it, they did not crucify the Lord of glory.	Sailie sina úquen ion turir mi randa sina isistie, an au sinteltes, ualte tarwestane i Heru alcaro.
But as is written: “ that eye has not seen and ear has not heard, that a man's heart did not think, those God has prepared for that love him.”	Mal ve ná técina: “Yar hen ua ecénie ar hlas ua ahlárie, yar atano enda ua sanne, tai Eru amanwie in melir se.”
For to us God has revealed them, by his spirit – for the spirit searches into all things, also the profound things of God.	An elven Eru apantane tai, faireryanen – an i faire şure mina ilye nati, yú Eruo tumne nati.
For who among men knows a man's matters except the man's spirit which is in him? In the same manner nobody has known God's matters except God's spirit.	An man mici atani ista atano nattor hequa i atano faire ya ea sesse? Mí imya lé úquen isistie Eruo nattor hequa Eruo faire.
But we received, not the world's spirit, but the spirit which comes from God, for us to know the things that by grace are given us by God.	Mal camnelve, lá i mardo faire, mal i faire ya tule Erullo, istielvan i nati yar lissenen nar ven antane lo Eru.
These things we also speak, not with words taught with man's wisdom, but with those taught by the spirit, while we judge the matters of the spirit with the words of the spirit.	Nati sine yú quetilve, lá quettainen peantane atano sailiénen, mal tainen peantane lo i faire, íre namilve i faireo nattor i faireo quettainen.
But a man ruled by his nature does not receive that come from God's spirit, for to him they are foolishness, and he cannot know them, for they are inquired into in the manner of the spirit.	Mal atan turúna nasseryanen ua came yar tulir Eruo fairello, an sen nalte úhandie, ar lá ece sen ista tai, an nalte minaşúraine mí faireo lé.
But a spiritual man inquires into all things, but he is inquired into by no one.	Mal atan faireva şure mina ilye nati, mal isse minaşúraina lo úquen ná.
For “who has known the Lord's mind, that he can teach him?” But we have the mind of Christ.	An “man isistie i Héruo sáma, i polis peanta hén?” Mal elme samir Hristo sáma.
And to me, brothers, it was not possible to speak to you as to people of the spirit, but as to people of the flesh, as to babes in Christ.	Ar inyen, hánor, lá ence quete lenna ve queninnar i faireo, mal ve queninnar i hráveo, ve lapsennar i Hristosse.
Milk I gave to you, not firm food, for that you could not yet eat. Indeed you still fail to be able,	Ilin antanen len, lá tanca matta, an ta en ualde polde mate. É hinna loitalde pole,
for you are still people of the flesh. For when is enmity and strife among you, are you not of the flesh and walk as men do?	an nalde hinna queni i hráveo. An íre ea hrúcen ar cos imíca le, ma ualde i hráveo ar vantar ve atani carir?
For when anyone says: “I am for Paul”, but another: “I am for Apollos”, do you not behave like men?	An íre aiquen quete: “Inye ná Paulon,” mal exe: “Inye ná Apollon”, ma ualde lenga ve atani?
What, then, is Apollos? Indeed what is Paul? Some servants by whom you believed, every person as the Lord allowed him.	Mana, tá, Apollo? É mana Paulo? Núror inen sávelde, ilya quén ve i Heru láve sen.
I planted, Apollos poured water, but God gave the growth.	Inye empanne, Apollo ulyane nén, mal Eru antane i alie.
Thus, who plants and who pours are both nothing; God is that gives growth.	Sie, ye empane ar ye ulya nar yúyo munta; Eru ná ye anta alie.
But who plants and who pours water are one, but every person will receive his own reward, by his labor.	Mal ye empane ar ye ulya nén nar er, ono ilya quén camuva véra paityalerya, molieryanen.
For together we are God's servants. But you are God's field, God's building.	An uo nalve Eruo núror. Mal elde nar resta Eruva, ataque Eruva.
Now, by God's grace that has been given me, as a wise chief of construction I have put a foundation, but another builds on it. But may everyone heed how he builds on it.	Sí, Eruo lissenen ya anaie antana nin, ve saila turco carastiéno apánien talma, mal exe carasta to sa. Mal nai ilquen cimuva manen carastas to sa.
For no one can put another foundation except that whis is put , which is Jesus Christ.	An úquen pole panya hyana talma hequa ta ya ná panyana, ya Yésus Hristo ná.
Now if anyone builds on this foundation – with gold, with silver, with jewels, with wood, with grass, with hay –	Sí qui aiquen carasta to talma sina – maltanen, telpenen, mírinen, toanen, salquenen, şaranen –
everyone's work will be shown, for the Day will show it , and it will be revealed as by fire, and everyone's labor, of what kind it is, the fire itself will test.	ilqueno molie nauva tanana, an i Aure tanuva sa, ar nauvas apantana ve nárnen, ar ilqueno molie, mana nostaleo sa ná, i nár imma tyastuva.
If anyone's labor, which he has built on it, remains, he will receive reward.	Qui aiqueno molie, ya acarasties to sa, lemya, camuvas paityale.
If anyone's work is burnt , that will be lost to him, but he will be saved – though as through fire.	Qui aiqueno molie urtana ná, ta nauva vanwa sen, mal isse nauva rehtana – ómu ve ter nár.
Do you not know that you are God's temple, and that God's spirit dwells in you?	Ma ualde ista i nalde corda Eruva, ar i Eruo faire mare lesse?
If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy him, for God's temple is holy, the temple that you are .	Qui aiquen nancare corda Eruva, Eru nancaruva sé, an corda Eruva aire ná, i corda ya elde nar.
May no one lie to himself: If anyone among you thinks that he is wise in this age, may he become a fool, in order to become wise.	Nai úquen huruva insen: Qui aiquen mici le sana i náse saila randa sinasse, nai oluvas auco, olien saila.
For this world's wisdom is foolishness to God, for is written: “He seizes the wise ones in their own cunning,”	An mar sino sailie úhandie ná Erun, an ná técina: “Mapas i sailar véra curultasse”,
and again: “The Lord knows the thaughts of the wise ones, that they are empty.”	ar ata: “I Héru ista i sailaron sanwi, i nalte luste.”
Therefore may no one praise himself in men, for you have all things.	Etta nai úquen laituva inse mi Atani, an samilde ilye nati.
No matter what , Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or the things that are now or the things that will come – everything you have, while you are of the Christ, and Christ is of God.	Lá cimila mana, Paulo hya Apollo hya Céfas hya i mar hya coivie hya qualme hya i nati yar ear sí hya i nati yar tuluvar – ilqua elde samir, lan elde nar i Hristova, ar Hristo Eruva ná.
May a man account us as Christ's servants, managing God's mysteries.	Nai atan vi-notuva ve Hristo núror, mahtala Eruo fóli.
Furthermore, what one seeks in overseers is that everyone is being found faithful.	Ente, ya mo cesta mi ortirmor ná in ilquen híraina voronda ná.
For me it is a very small matter to be examined by you or by human judges. Indeed I do not examine myself.	Inyen ná ita cinta natto náve hentaina lo elde hya lo fírime námor. É inye ua henta imne.
For I know nothing against myself. And yet I am not thus shown just, but who examines me is the Lord.	An istan munta inyenna. Ananta uan sie tanana faila, mal ye ni-henta i Heru ná.
Therefore do not pass judement before the time, until the Lord comes, who will bring the hidden things of the dark into the light and also will make known the thoughts of the hearts, and then will be praise for everyone from God.	Etta áva name nó i lúme, tenna i Heru tule, ye taluva i morniéno nurtane nati mir i cala ar yú caruva sinwe i endaron sanwi, ar tá euva laitale ilquenen Erullo.
Here, brothers, I use myself and Apollos as examples, for your good. Thus, by heeding us , you may learn this thing: “Do not go beyond the things written, to stop a person from elevating himself over another.”	Sisse, hánor, yuhtan imne ar Apollo ve epemmar, máraldan. Sie, cimiénen met, lertalde pare nat sina: “Áva mene han i técinar, pustien quén ortávello inse or exe.”
For what exalts you above others? Indeed what do you have that you have not received? But if you received it, how is that you praise yourself as if you did not receive it?	An mana orhale lyé or exi? É mana samil ya ual acámie? Mal qui camnelyes, manen ná i laitalyexe ve au ual camne sa?
Are you filled even now? Are you rich even now? Have you become kings without us? I wish that you did indeed become kings, for us to rule with you!	Ma nalde quátine yando sí? Ma nalde lárie yando sí? Ma olólielde arani pen elme? Merin i é ollelde arani, turielman aselde!
For seems to me that God has put us, the apostles, last, as men condemned to death, for we have been a spectacle to the world, and to angels, and to men.	An neme nin in Eru apánie mé, i aposteli, métime, ve neri námine qualmen, an anaielme ettanáve i marden, ar valain, ar atanin.
We are fools by the Christ, but you are intelligent in Christ; we are weak, but you are strong; you are glorious, while we lack glory.	Nalme aucor Hristonen, mal elde nar hande Hristosse; nalme milye, mal elde nar torye; nalde alcarinque, lan elme penir alcar.
Until this time we are hungry and thirsty and naked and beaten, without a home,	Tenna lúme sina nalme maite ar soice ar helde ar pétine, pen már,
and we toil, laboring with our own hands. When we receive mockery, we bless; when we are being persecuted, we bear it;	ar mótalme, molila vére málmanten. Íre camilme yaiwe, aistalme; íre nalme roitaine, colilmes;
when one speaks evil about us, we answer with friendly words. We have been as the world's refuse, a stain to be washed off all things, until now.	íre mo quete ulco pa me, hanquetilme nilde quettainen. Anaielme ve i mardo auhanta, vaxe náven sóvina ilye natillon, tenna sí.
I am not writing these things to humiliate you, but to show to you what is right, as my beloved children.	Uan téca nati sine nucumien le, mal tanáven len ya vanima ná, ve melde hínanyar.
For if you had countless people instructing you in Christ, you indeed do not have numerous fathers , for in the Christ Jesus I became your father by the gospel.	An au sámelde únótime queni peantala len Hristosse, é ualde same rimbe atalli, an i Hristo Yésusse ollen atarelda i evandilyonnen.
Therefore I ask of you: Walk in my path!	Etta arcan lello: Á vanta tienyasse!
For this reason I have sent to you Timothy, my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who will make you recall my ways in Christ Jesus, as I instruct in every place and every congregation.	Sina castanen ementayen lenna Timoşeo, melda ar voronda hínanya i Herusse, ye tyaruva le enyale lényar mi Hristo Yésus, ve peantan mi ilya nóme ar ilya ocombesse.
As if I am not coming to you, some have elevated themselves,	Ve au uan túla lenna, ennoli orortayer inte,
but I will come to you soon, if the Lord wishes. Then I will know, not the speaking of those that have elevated themselves, but their power.	mal tuluvan lenna ron, qui i Heru mere. Tá istuvan, lá i quetie ion orortayer inte, mal túrelta.
What do you want? Am I to come to you bringing a rod, or bringing love and a gentle spirit?	Mana merilde? Ma tuluvan lenna talala vandil, hya talala melme ar moica faire?
Indeed one hears about fornication among you, and such fornication that does not happen even among the non-Jews – a man has his father's wife!	É mo hlare pa hrupuhtie mici le, ar taite hruputhie ya ua marta yando imíca i Úyúrar – nér same ataryo veri!
And you think well of yourselves! You would have done better if you had grief, throwing this man out of your midst.	Ar elde sanar mai pa inde! Cáriévanelde arya au sámelde naire, hatila nér sina et endeldallo.
But I, though I am away in the body, but with you in the spirit, have judged even now – as if I were there – the man that has behaved so:	Ono inye, ómu nanye oa i hroasse, mal aselde i fairesse, anámie yando sí – ve au anen tasse – i nér ye elengie sie:
In the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, when you are together and also my spirit is there having the power of Jesus Christ our Lord,	Yésus Hristo Herulvo essenen, íre nalde uo ar yú ninya faire ea tasse arwa i túreo Yésus Hristo Herulvo,
you are to give this man over to Satan. Thus his flesh will be destroyed, but the spirit will be saved on the Lord's day.	alde anta taite nér olla Sátanen. Sie hráverya nauva nancarna, mal i faire nauva rehtana mí Heruo ré.
You do not have a good reason for exalting yourselves. Do you not know that a small leaven causes the whole dough to swell?	Ualde same mára casta orhalien inde. Ma ualde ista i pitya pulmaxe tyare i quanda maxe tiuya?
Take away the old leaven, for you to be a new dough which is without leaven. For our sacrifice of passover, Christ, has been slain.	Á mapa oa i yára pulmaxe, náveldan vinya maxe ya pen pulmaxe ná. An yancalva lahtiéva, Hristo, anaie nahtana.
Thus let us make a festival, not with the old leaven, also without leaven of evil and of wickedness, but having unfermented breads of purity and of truth.	Sie alve care aşar, lá i yára pulmaxenen, yú pen pulmaxe ulcuva ar olciéva, mal arwe alapulúne massaron poiciéno ar nanwiéno.
In my letter I wrote to you: Do not remain among fornicators.	Mi tecettanya tencen lenna: Áva lemya mici hrupuhtor.
Not that you can turn yourselves fully away from fornicators, or from greedy people or people who worship idols. Then indeed it was necessary for you to pass out of the world!	Lá i polilde quere inde aqua oa ho hrupuhtor, hya ho milce queni hya queni i tyerir cordoni. Tá é mauyane len auta et i mardello!
But now I am writing to you: Do not remain with anyone called a brother who is a fornicator, or a person who speaks mockery, or who drinks too much, or who is a robber. Furthermore, do not eat with such a person.	Mal sí técan lenna: Áva lemya as aiquen estaina háno ye hrupuhto ná, hya quén ye quete yaiwe, hya ye suce acca ole, hya ye arpo ná. Ente, áva mate as taite quén.
For how is it necessary for me to judge that are on the outside? Do not you judge that are on the inside,	An manen mauya nin name i ear i ettesse? Ma ualde namir i ear i mityasse,
while God judges that are on the outside? Send the evil person away out of your midst!	lan Eru name i ear i ettesse? Á menta i ulca quén oa et endeldallo!
Does anyone among you that have a strife against another dare to be jugded by unrighteous men and not by the holy ones?	Ma aiquen mici le ye same cos exenna verya náve námina lo úfaile neri ar lá epe i airi?
Or do you not know that the holy ones will judge the world? And if the world will be judged by you, are you not worthy to judge the tiniest matters?	Hya ma ualde ista in i airi namuvar i mar? Ar qui i mar nauva námina lo elde, ma ualde valde name i ancinte nattor?
Do you not know that we will judge angels? Then why do you not matters of this life?	Ma ualde ista i namuvalve vali? Tá manen laialve coivie sino nattor?
If, then, you indeed have matters of this life about which you want a judgement, do you set as judges the men despised in the congregation?	Qui, tá, é samilde nattor coivie sino pa yar merilde námie, ma panyalde ve námor i neri nattíraine i ocombesse?
I am talking to shame you. Do you then lack a single wise man among you who will know judge among his brothers,	Quétan nucumien le. Ma tá penilde erya saila nér mici le ye istuva name imbi hánoryar,
but a brother has a lawsuit against a brother, and that before people who do not believe?	mal háno same cos hánonna, ar ta epe queni i uar save?
Indeed you are defeated in the moment that you have lawsuits at all, one against the other. How is that you are not sooner wronged? How is it that you are not sooner deprived?	É nalde turúne mi lú ya samilde costi aqua, quén i exenna. Manen ná i ualde ambe ron nehtane? Manen ná i ualde ambe ron racine?
No, you wrong and make others deprived, and that your brothers! 	Ui, nehtalde ar carir exi racine, ar ta hánoldar!
Or do you not know that unrighteous people will not be heirs to God's kingdom? Do not err! Fornicators and people that worship idols or defile marriage, and men being kept for a purpose beside nature, or men that lie with men,	Hya ualde istar in úfaile queni uar nauva aryoni Eruo araniéno? Áva vare! Hrupuhtor ar queni i tyerir cordoni hya vahtar vestale, ar neri hépaine ennen ara nasse, ar neri i caitar as neri,
and thieves, and greedy ones, or people that drink too much, and people that speak mockery, and robbers, will not be heirs to God's kingdom.	ar pilur, ar milcar, ar queni i sucir acca ole, ar queni i quetir yaiwe, ar arpor, uar nauva aryoni Eruo araniéno.
And yet that is what some among you were. But you have been washed clean, but you have been hallowed, but you have been made just by the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, and by the Spirit of our God.	Ananta ta ná ya ennoli mici le náner. Mal anaielde sóvine poice, mal anaielde airinte, mal anaielde cárine faile, i essenen Yésus Hristo Herulvo, ar Ainolvo Fairenen.
I may do all things, but all things are not beneficial. I may do all things, but I will not allow that I will be led under the power of a single thing.	Lertan care ilye nati, mal ilye nati uar aşie. Lertan care ilye nati, mal uan lavuva i nauvan tulyana nu i túre erya nato.
Food for the belly, and the belly for food; but the Lord will destroy both. The body is not for fornication, but for the Lord, and the Lord is for the body.	Matta i cumban, ar i cumba mattan; mal Eru nancaruva yúyo. I hroa ua hrupuhtien, mal i Herun; ar i Heru ná i hroan.
But God raised the Lord and will also raise us by his might.	Mal Eru ortane i Heru ar yú ortauva vé melehteryanen.
But do you not know that your bodies are Christ's body-parts? Am I to take away the Christ's body-parts and make them a harlot's body-parts? By no means!	Ma ualde ista i hroaldar nar Hristo hroarantar? Ma mapuvan oa i Hristo hroarantar ar caruva tai imbacindeo hroarantar? Laume!
Or do you know that who has become one with a harlot is one body with her? For “the two”, he says, “will be one flesh”.	Hya ualde ista i ye olólie er as imbacinde hroa er ná óse? An “i atta”, quetis, “nauvat hráve er”.
But who has become one with the Lord is one spirit with him.	Mal ye olólie er as i Heru faire er ná óse.
Flee from fornication! Every other sin which a man can do is on the outside of his body, but who fornicates is sinning against his own body.	Uşa hrupuhtiello! Ilya hyana úcare ya atan pole care ná hroaryo ettesse, mal ye hrupuhta úcára véra hroaryanna.
Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit in you, which you have from God? Furthermore, you do not possess yourselves,	Hya ma ualde ista i hroalda corda ná i Aire Faireva lesse, ya samilde Erullo? Ente, ualde haryaldexer,
for you were traded for a sum. Therefore give glory to God with your body!	an anelde mancane nonwen. Etta alde anta alcar Erun hroaldanen!
Concerning the things of which you wrote: Not touching a woman is for a man beneficial,	Pa i nati yaron tencelde: Lá appie nís neren aşea ná,
but to stop fornication it is necessary that every man has his own wife and every woman her own husband.	mal pustien hrupuhtie mauya in ilya nér same véra verirya ar ilya nís véra verurya.
It is necessary for the man to give his debt to his wife , but it is also necessary for the wife to to the same to her husband.	Mauya i verun anta rohtarya veriryan, mal yú mauya i verin care i imya veruryan.
The wife does not have mastery over her own body, but her husband has. In the same manner, the husband as well does not have mastery over his own body, but his wife has.	I veri ua same túre or véra hroarya, mal verurya same. Mí imya lé, yú i veru ua same túre or véra hroarya, mal verirya same.
Do not make one another deprived, except when you are of one mind to be away from the other, for a time, to give yourselves opportunity for prayer. Then come together again, to stop Satan from tempting you since you cannot control your lust.	Áva care quén i exe racine, hequa íre naste er sámo náve oa i exello, ter lúme, antáven lent ecie hyamien. Tá tula uo ata, pustien Sátan şahtiello let pan uaste pole ture mailesta.
But this is a thing I allow, not a thing that I command.	Ono si nat ná ya lavin, lá nat ya canin.
But I wish that all men were like I am. And yet everyone has his own gift from God, one in this manner, another in that manner.	Mal merin in ilye atani náner ve inye ná. Ananta ilquen same véra annarya Erullo, quén mi sina lé, exe mi sana lé.
Now I speak to those that have not married, and to the women whose husband has died: It is beneficial for them if they are still like I also am.	Sí quetin innar uar evérie, ar i nissinnar ion veru aquálie: Tien aşea ná qui hinna nalte ve yú inye ná.
But if they lack self-control, let them marry, for if they marry, that is better than that they burn with desire.	Mal qui ualte pole ture mailelta, nai veryuvalte, an qui veryalte, ta arya ná lá in uryalte yérenen.
To the people that have married I give this command – and yet not I, but the Lord: A wife may not abandon her husband.	I queninnar i evérier antan canwa sina – ananta lá inye, mal i Heru: Veri ua lerta hehta verurya.
But if indeed she abandons him, it is necessary for her to remain without a man, or to make peace with her husband; and a husband may not abandon his wife.	Mal qui é hehtas hé, mauya sen lemya ú nero, hya care raine as verurya; ar veru ua lerta hehta verirya.
But to the others I – not the Lord – say: If is a brother having a wife who does not believe, and the woman by her free will wishes to live with him, he may not abandon the woman.	Mal i exennar inye – lá i Heru – quete: Qui ea háno arwa verio ye ua save, ar i nís léra nirmeryanen mere mare óse, uas lerta hehta i nís.
And a woman having a husband who does not believe, and yet the man wishes to live with her by his free will, may not abandon her husband.	Ar nís arwa veruo ye ua save, ananta i nér mere mare óse léra nirmeryanen, ua lerta hehta verurya.
For the husband who does not believe is sanctified by the woman, and the wife that does not believe is sanctified by the brother. If not your children were unclean, but now they are holy.	An i veru ye ua save airinta ná i nissenen, ar i veri ye ua save airinta ná i hánonen. Qui lá, hínaldar anwave náner úpoice, mal sí nalte airi.
But if the person that does not believe wants to go away, let him/her go away; a brother or sister is not bound in such circymstances but God has called you to peace.	Ono qui i quén ye ua save mere auta, lava sen auta; háno hya néşa ua nútina taiti sómassen, mal Eru aiálie le rainenna.
For, wife, do you know whether you will save your husband? Or, husband, do you know whether you will save your wife?	An, veri, ma istal qui rehtuval verulya? Hya, veru, ma istal qui rehtuval verilya?
Just as the Lord has portioned out to all, so may everyone walk as God has called him. Thus I command in all the congregations.	Aqua ve i Heru etasátie ilquenen, sie nai ilquen vanta ve Eru aiálie se. Sie canin ilye i ocombessen.
Was anyone called circumcized? May he not become uncircumcized. Was anyone called without circumcision? May he not become circumcized.	Ma aiquen náne yálina oscirna? Nai uas oluva úoscirna. Ma aiquen náne yálina pen oscirie? Nai uas oluva oscirna.
Circumcision is not important, and lack of circumcision is not important, but heeding God's commandments is indeed important.	Oscirie ua valdea, ar penie osciriéva ua valdea, mal cimie Eruo axani é valdea ná.
May everyone remain in the condition in which he was called.	Nai ilquen lemyuva i sómasse yasse anes yálina.
Were you called as a slave? Do not let that cause grief to you, but if it is also possible for you to become freed, instead seize the opportunity.	Ma anel yálina ve mól? Áva lave tan tyare naire lyen, mal qui yú ece lyen ole leryana, i mende á mapa i ecie.
For anyone in the Lord who was called when he was a slave is Lord's freed ; in the same manner, who was called as a free person is Christ's slave.	An aiquen i Herusse ye náne yálina íre anes mól ná i Heruo leryana; mi imya lé, ye náne yálina ve léra quén ná Hristo mól.
You were traded to him for a sum; do not become slaves to men.	Anelde mancane sen nonwen; áva ole móli atanin.
May everyone, not heeding the circumstance in which he was called, remain in it, before God.	Nai ilquen, lá cimila i sóma yasse anes yálina, lemyuva sasse, epe Eru.
Concerning the virgins I do not have a command from the Lord, but I give my thoughts as a person who has received the mercy from the Lord that I am faithful.	Pa i vendi uan same canwa i Herullo, mal antan sanwenyar ve quén ye acámie i oravie i Herullo i nanye voronda.
Therefore, heeding the existing need, I think that this is the best for a man: that he remains as he is.	Etta, címala i eala maure, sanan i si i arya ná neren: i lemyas ve náse.
Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek releasing. Are you released from a wife? Do not seek a wife.	Ma nalye nútina verinna? Áva cesta lehtie. Ma nalye lehtana verillo? Áva cesta veri.
But also if you did get married to a woman, you were not going to sin . And if a virgin got married, she was not going to sin . But who do so will have tribulations in their flesh. But I try to save you from grief.	Mal yú qui é veryanel nissenna, ual úcarumne. Ar qui vende veryane, uas úcarumne. Mal i carir sie samuvar şangier hráveltasse. Ono nevin le-rehta nairello.
But this thing I say, brothers: The remaining time is short. From now it is necessary for who have a wife to be as if they lacked a wife;	Ono nat sina quetin, hánor: I lemyala lúme şinta ná. Ho sí mauya in samir veri náve ve au pennelte veri;
furthermore, for the wailing to be as if they were not wailing, and for that have joy as if they lacked joy, and for that trade to be as those that do not possess,	ente, i yaimeain náve ve au únelte yaimie, ar in samir alasse náve ve au pennelte alasse, ar in mancar ve i uar harya,
and for those that use the world to be as that do not fully use it, for the form of this world passes away.	ar in yuhtar i mar náve ve i uar aqua yuhta sa, an mar sino canta auta.
Indeed I wish that you will be free from concern. The man that does not get married to a woman gives his mind to the the matters of the Lord, how he will receive the Lord's praise.	É merin i nauvalde lére quárelello. I nér ye ua evérie nissenna anta sámarya i Heruo nattoin, manen camuvas i Heruo laitale.
But who has not maried gives his mind to the things of the world, how he will receive his wife's praise,	Mal ye evérie anta sámarya i mardo natin, manen camuvas veriryo laitale,
and he is split. Furthermore, the woman that has not married, or the maiden, gives her mind to the matters of the Lord, allowing her to be holy in her body and her spirit alike. But the woman that has gotten married gives her mind to the matters of the world, how she can receive her husband's praise.	ar náse şanca. Ente, i nís ye ua evérie, hya i vende, anta sámarya i Heruo nattoin, lavila sen náve aire mi hroarya ar fairerya véla. Mal i nís ye evérie anta sámarya i mardo nattoin, manen polis came veruryo laitale.
But this thing I am saying since that is beneficial for you, not to deprive you of liberty, but to cause you to have proper behavior, in which you adhere to the Lord without impediment.	Ono nat sina quétan pan ta aşea len ná, lá avaleryáven le, mal tyarien le same vanima lengie, yasse himyalde i Heru pen taptie.
But if anyone thinks that his behavior towards his virgin is not proper, if she is beyond her bloom, and by need will be so – may he do what he wishes; he does not sin. Let them marry.	Mal qui aiquen sana i lengierya venderyanna ua vanima, qui náse han lostierya, ar maurenen euva sie – nai caruvas ya meris; uas úcare. Lava tún verya.
But if anyone's heart is firm, not having need, but he has power over his own will and has made the choice in his own heart that her he will keep a virgin, he will do well.	Mal qui aiqueno enda tulca ná, lá arwa maureo, mal samis túre or véra nirmerya ar acárie i cilme véra endaryasse i hé hepuvas vende, caruvas mai.
Thus that marries off his virgin does well, but that does not marries her off, will do better.	Sie ye verta venderya care mai, mal ye ua verta hé, caruva arya.
A woman is obliged through the whole time that her husband lives. But if her husband expires, she is free to get married to whom she wishes, though only in the Lord.	Nís nauta ná ter i quanda lúme ya verurya coita. Mal qui verurya effire, náse léra verien yenna meris, ómu rie i Herusse.
But she will be happier if she remains single, as the matter seems to me. Indeed I think that I also have God's spirit.	Mal nauvas ambe valima qui lemyas erya, ve i natto neme inyen. É sanan i yú samin Eruo faire.
Now about foods sacrificed to idols: We know that all among us have knowledge. Knowledge makes people haughty, but love builds them up.	Sí pa mattar yácine cordonin: Istalve in illi mici vi samir istya. Istya care queni turquime, mal melme carasta te ama.
If anyone things that he knows a thing, he still does not know it like it is necessary for him to know it.	Qui aiquen sana i istas nat, en uas ista sa ve mauya sen ista sa.
But if anyone loves God, this person is known by him.	Mal qui aiquen mele Eru, quén sina sinwa ná lo hé.
Now about the eating of foods sacrificed to idols: We know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that does not exist god except one.	Sí pa i matie mattaiva yácine cordonin: Istalve i cordon munta ná i mardesse, ar i lá ea aino hequa er.
For though are they that are called “gods”, in heaven or on earth, exactly like are numerous “gods” and numerous “lords”,	An ómu ear té i nar estaine “ainor”, menelde hya cemende, aqua ve ear rimbe “ainor” ar rimbe “heruvi”,
 is for us a single God, the Father from whom all things are, and is a single Lord, Jesus Christ by whom all things are, an we by him.	ea elven erya Aino, i Atar yello ilye nati nar, ar ea erya Heru, Yésus Hristo yenen ilye nati nar, ar elve issenen.
And yet all do not have this knowledge. But some, whose habit until now concerns the idol, eat food as a thing sacrificed to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is being defiled.	Ananta illi uar same istya sina. Mal ennoli, ion haime tenna sí ape i cordon, matir matta ve nat yácina cordonen, and immotuntielta, nála milya, ná vahtaina.
But food does not make us good in God's eyes. If we do not eat, we do not fall short, and if indeed we eat, we are not better .	Mal matta ua vi-caruva mani Eruo hendusse. Qui ualve mate, ualve loita, ar qui é matilve, ualve arye.
But take heed that this right of yours will not in way be a cause of slipping for the weak ones.	Mal cima i sina lertielda ua mi lé nauva casta taltiéva i milyain.
For if anyone sees you, the person having knowledge, lying by the table for a meal on a temple of the idols, will the weak person's conscience not be built up, to the point of eating foods sacrificed to idols?	An qui aiquen cenuva lye, i quén arwa istyo, caitala ara i sarno matten cordasse i cordonion, ma i milya queno immotuntie lá nauva carastana ama, tenna matie mattar yácine cordonin?
By your knowledge the weak person will indeed be destroyed, your brother for whom Christ died!	Istyalyanen i milya quén é nauva nancarna, hánolya yen Hristo qualle!
But when you sin in this way against your brothers and wound their conscience that is weak, you are sinning against the Christ.	Mal íre sie úcarilde hánoldannar ar harnar immotuntielta ya milya ná, úcáralde i Hristonna.
Therefore, if food causes my brother to stumble , I will not ever eat flesh again, to stop myself from causing my brother to stumble.	Etta, qui matta tyare hánonya talta, uan oi matuva hráve ata, pustien imne tyariello hánonya talta.
Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you not my work in the Lord?	Ma uan léra? Ma uan apostel? Ma uan ecénie Yésus Herulva? Ma ualde molienya i Herusse?
If I am not an apostle to others, indeed I am so to you, for you are the seal of my being an apostle, in the Lord.	Qui uan apostel exin, é nanye sie len, an nalde i lihta návenyo apostel, i Herusse.
This answer I give to that examine me:	Hanquenta sina antan in hentar ni:
We may eat and drink, it it not so?	Lertalme mate ar suce, ma naite?
We may bring a sister as wife, as do the others apostles and the Lord's brothers and Cephas, is it not so?	Lertalme tala néşa ve veri, ve carir i hyane aposteli ar i Heruo hánor ar Céfas, ma naite?
Or may Barnabas and I alone not be free from labour?	Hya ma Varnavas ar inye erinque uar lerta náve lére moliello?
Who is ever a soldier on his own money? . Who plants a garden of wines and does not eat of the fruit from it? Or who is shepherd of a flock and does not drink of the milk from the flock?	Man oi ohtar ná véra telperyanen? Man empane tarwa liantassion ar ua mate i yáveo sallo? Hya man mavar lamáreo ná ar ua suce i ilimo i lamárello?
Surely I do not speak so in a man's manner? Or does the law not also say these things.	Lau quetin sie mi atano lé? Hya ma i şanye ua yú quete nati sine?
For in the law of Moses is written: “You are not to stop a bull from eating while it is crushing the grain.” Are bulls important to God?	An Móseo şanyesse ná técina: “Ávalye pusta mondo matiello lan rácas i ore.” Ma mondor nar valde Erun?
Or does he not speak so entirely for our good? Indeed for us that was written, for is proper that in hope the man behind the plough shall work, and for the man that breaks the grain is proper that he does so having hope that he will receive of the fruit of his labour.	Hya ma uas quete sie aqua máralvan? É elven ta náne técina, an vanima ná i mi estel i nér ca i hyar moluva, ar i neren ye race i ore vanima ná i caris sie arwa estelo i camuvas i yáveo molieryo.
If we have sown things of the spirit for you, is it a big thing if we shall reap things of the flesh from you?	Qui erérielme nati i faireva elden, ma hoa nat ná qui elme cirihtuvar nati i hráveva lello?
If others have a part in this authority over you, do we not more so? And yet we have not used this power, but we are bearing everything, to stop ourselves from turning anyone away from the gospel about the Christ.	Qui exeli samir ranta mi túre sina or le, ma elme laiar ambe sie? Ananta ualme uiuhtie túre sina, mal cólalme ilqua, pustien imme queriello aiquen oa ho i evandilyon pa i Hristo.
Do you not know that the servants of the holy things receive their livelihood from the Temple, and the servants beside the altar have their portion of the food sacrificed on the altar?	Ma ualde ista in i núror i airi nation camir laulestalta i Cordallo, ar i núror ara i yangwa samir masselta i matto yácina i yangwasse?
In the same manner the Lord also commanded that they that make the gospel known are to receive their livelihood by the gospel.	Mí imya lé i Heru yú canne i té i carir i evandilyon sinwa camuvar laulestalta i evandilyonnen.
But I have not used a single of these things. Indeed I do not write these words in order to receive them. I would have wanted to die before I would have let anyone take away my reason for praising myself.	Mal uan uiuhtie erya ion nati sine. É uan tecin quettar sine camien tai. Meriévanen quale nó láviévanen aiquenen mapa oa castanya laitien imne.
For if I make known the gospel, that is not for me a reason to praise myself, for a necessity has been put on me. Woe to me if I did not make known the gospel!	An qui carin sinwa i evandilyon, ta ua nin casta laitien imne, an maure anaie panyana nisse. Horro nin au uan carne sinwa i evandilyon!
If I do so by my free will, I have a reward, but if I do it under compulsion, I still have a overseership put upon me.	Qui carin sie léra nirmenyanen, samin paityale, mal qui carinyes nu mausta, en samin ortírie panyana nisse.
What, then, is my reward? This thing: that when I make the gospel known, I give it without reward , not fully using the power that I have by the gospel.	Mana, tá, paityalenya? Nat sina: in íre carin i evandilyon sinwa, antanyes pen paityale, lá aqua yuhtie i túre ya samin i evandilyonnen.
For though I am free from all, I have made myself thrall of all, in order to save the greater number .	An ómu nanye léra ho illi, acárienyexe illion mól, rehtien i ambe rimbe.
To Jews I became a Jew, for me to gain Jews; to that were under law I became as a person under law though I am not under law, to gain that are under law.	Yúrain ollen ve Yúra, ñetienyan Yúrar; in náner nu şanye ollen ve quén nu şanye ómu inye ua nu şanye, ñetienyan i nar nu şanye.
To the people without law I became like a person without law – though I am not a person without law to God, but under the law of Christ – to gain those that lack law.	I quenin pen şanye ollen ve quén pen şanye – ómu uan quén pen şanye Erun, mal nu Hristo şanye – ñetien i penir şanye.
To the weak I made myself weak, for me to gain the weak. To all I have become all things, for me to gain at least some people.	I milyain ollen milya, ñetienyan i milyar. Illin olólien ilye nati, ñetienyan i ampityasse ennoli.
But I do everything for the gospel, for me to have a part in it.	Mal carin ilqua i evandilyonen, samienyan ranta sasse.
Do you not know that in a race, all the people run, but one alone receives the gift of winning? Run in a manner that will let you receive it!	Ma ualde ista i mi norme, ilye i queni norir, mal er erinqua came i anna apaireo? Nora mi lé ya lavuva len camitas!
Furthermore, every man that runs in a race shows control of himself in all things. They do so to receive a wreath that withers, but we a wreath that will not ever wither.	Ente, ilya nér ye nore i normesse tana turie inseva mi ilye nati. Té carir sie camien ríe ya hesta, mal elve ríe ya ua oi hestuva.
Therefore I indeed do not run in an uncertain manner; I beat in a manner by which I do not just strike the air.	Etta é uan nore mi útanca lé; palpan mi lé yanen uan rie pete i vista,
but I punish my body and lead it as a thrall, that I who have instructed others will not be turned away.	mal paimetan hroanya ar tulya sa ve mól, in inye ye peánie exin ua nauva quérina oa.
I do not wish that you lack this knowledge, brothers: that our fathers were all under the cloud and all passed through the sea	Uan mere i penilde istya sina, hánor: in atarilvar náner illi nu i lumbo ar illi lahtaner ter i ear
and all were baptized into Moses by the cloud and by the sea;	ar illi náner sumbane mir Móses i lumbunen ar i earnen;
and all ate the same food of spirit,	ar illi manter i imya matta faireva,
and all drank the same drink of spirit. For they drank from the rock of spirit that followed them, and that rock was the Christ.	ar illi suncer i imya yulda faireva. An suncelte i ondollo faireva ya hilyane te, ar sana ondo náne i Hristo.
But the greater number among them did not please God, for their corpses were scattered in the wilderness.	Mal i ambe rimbe queni mici te uar fastane Eru, an loicoltar náner vintane i ravandasse.
These things are put before you as examples, to stop us from wanting evil things, as they wanted them.	Nati sine nar panyane epe vi ve epemmar, vi-pustien meriello ulce nati, ve té merner tai.
Furthermore, do not worship idols, like some among them did, as is written: “The people sat down to eat and to drink, and then they arose to play.”	Ente, áva tyere cordoni, ve ennoli mici té carner, ve ná técina: “I lie hamune matien ar sucien, ar tá orontelte tyalien.”
Also, do not fornicate, as some among them fornicated, and they fell, twenty-three thousands in a single day.	Yú, ávalve hrupuhta, ve ennoli mici té hrupuhtaner, ar lantanelte, húmi nelde ar yúquean erya auresse.
Also, do not test the Lord, as some among them tested him and were destroyed by the serpents.	Ente, ávalve tyasta i Héru, ve ennoli mici té tyasanter se ar náner nancarne i leucainen.
Also, do not be grumbling, as some among them grumbled and were slain by the Destroyer.	Yú, áva na nurrula, ve ennoli mici té nurruner ar náner nahtane lo i Nancáro.
These things happened to them as examples, for they were written to teach us about our dangers, we that have come to the end of the age.	Nati sine martaner tien ve epemmar, an anelte técine peantáven ven pa raxelvar, elve i utúlier i rando mettanna.
Therefore, who thinks that he stands, let him take heed that he does not fall.	Etta, ye sana i taris, isse na cimuva in uas lanta.
You still have not met temptation beyond which is normal for men. But God is faithful, and he will not allow that you are tested beyond which you can bear, but with the temptation he will also bring the way out of it, to allow you to be firm.	Hinna ualde evélie úşahtie han ya şanya ná atanin. Mal Eru voronda ná, ar uas lavuva i nalde tyastaine han ya polilde cole, mal as i úşahtie yú taluvas i tie et sallo, lavien len náve tulce.
Therefore, my beloved, free from idol worship.	Etta, meldanyar, uşa cordontyermello!
I speak as to people having insight; judge for yourselves what I say.	Carpan ve queninnar arwe terceno; nama inden ya quetin.
The cup of blessing that we bless, does it not give us a part in Christ's blood? The bread that we break, does it not give us a part in Christ's body?	I yulma aistiéva ya aistalve, ma uas anta ven ranta i Hristo sercesse? I massa ya racilve, ma uas anta ven ranta i Hristo hroasse?
Since is one bread, we are one body though we are numerous, for all among us have a part in that one bread.	Pan ea er massa, nalve er hroa ómu nalve rimbe, an illi mici vi samir ranta mi sana er massa.
Look at which is Israel in the manner of the flesh! Do not those that eat the sacrifices have a part with the altar?	Á yéta ya ná Israel mí lé i hráveo! Ma i matir i yancar uar same ranta as i yangwa?
What, then, am I do say? That that which has been sacrificed to an idol is an actual thing, or that the idol is an actual thing?	Mana, tá, quetuvan? I ta ya anaie yácina cordonen anwa nat ná, hya i cordon anwa nat ná?
No, but I say that those that the nations sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons and not to God, and I do not wish that you are to have a part with the demons.	Ui, mal quetin i tai yar i nóri yacir, yacilte raucoin ar lá Erun, ar uan mere i samuvalde ranta as i raucor.
It is not possible for you to drink from the Lord's cup and from the demons' cup; it is not possible for you to eat from the table of the Lord and from the table of the demons.	Ua ece len suce i Heruo yulmallo ar i raucoron yulmallo; ua ece len mate sarnollo i Heruva ar sarnollo i raucoiva.
Or do we want to arouse the burning spirit of the Lord? Surely we are not stronger than him?	Hya ma merilve valta i Heruo uryala şúle? Lau nalve torye lá sé?
Everything is allowed, but everything is not beneficial. Everything is allowed, but everything does not build up.	Ilqua lávina ná, mal ilqua ua aşea. Ilqua lávina ná, mal ilqua ua carasta ama.
It is necessary that everyone heeds, not his own affairs, but also those of the other person.	Mauya in ilquen cime, lá vére nattoryar, mal yú tai i hyana queno.
Everything that is being sold in a meat market you may eat; it is not necessary for you to ask questions by reason of your conscience,	Ilqua ya vácaina ná mi hrávemancanóme lertalde mate; ua mauya len maquete maquetier castanen immotuntieldo,
for “belonging to the Lord are the earth and which fills it”.	an “i Heruo nar i cemen ar ya quate sa”.
If anyone among who do not believe calls on you and you wish to go, eat everything that is put before you, without questions by reason of your conscience.	Qui aiquen mici i uar save yale le are merilde mene, mata ilqua ya panyana epe le ná, pen maquetier castanen immotuntieldo.
But if anyone says to you: “This thing has been sacrificed,“ do not eat, by reason of who told you that, and by reason of conscience.	Mal qui aiquen quete lenna: “Nat sina anaie yácina”, áva mate, castanen yeo nyarne len ta, ar castanen immotuntiéno.
Conscience, I say, not your own, but that of the other person. For how is that one is to judge my freedom by the conscience of another? TIL HIT	Immotuntie, quetin, lá véralya, mal ta i hyana queno. An manen ná i mo namuva ninya lérie exeo immotuntiénen?
But if I am eating giving thanks to God, how is that I am being blasphemed concerning that for which I give thanks?	Mal qui mátan hantala Erun, manen ná i nanye naiquétaina pa ta yan antan hantale?
Therefore, no matter if you eat or you drink or do another thing, do everything for God's glory.	Etta, lá címala qui matilde hya sucilde hya carir hyana nat, cara ilqua Eruo alcaren.
Keep yourselves from being causes of stumbling, to Jews and Greeks and God's congregation alike,	Hepa inde návello castar taltiéva, Yúrain ar Hellenyain ar Eruo ocomben véla,
like I as well make all happy in all things – not seeking which is beneficial to me, but which will be beneficial for the greater number of people, for them to be saved.	ve yú inye care illi valime mi ilye nati – lá cestala ya aşea nin ná, mal ya nauva aşea i ambe rimbe quenin, náveltan rehtane.
Walk my my path, as I walk in Christ's path.	Á vanta tienyasse, ve inye vanta i Hristo tiesse.
I praise you since in all things you keep me in mind, and you stick to the customs wholly as I gave them to you.	Laitan le pan mi ilye nati ni-hepilde sámasse, ar himyalde i haimi aqua ve antanenyet len.
But I wish that you know that every man's head is the Christ, and a woman's head is the man, and the Christ's head is God.	Mal merin in istalde in ilya nero cas i Hristo ná, ar nisso cas i nér ná, ar i Hristo cas Eru ná.
Every man who prays or speaks as a prophet without a covering on his head, humiliates his head, for that is the same thing as if his hair was cut off.	Ilya nér ye hyame hya quete ve Erutercáno pen túpo caryasse nucume carya,
but every woman who prays or speaks as a prophet when her head is not covered, brings humiliation upon her head, for that is the same thing as if her hair was cut off.	mal ilya nís ye hyame hya quete ve Erutercáno íre carya ua tópina, tala nucumie caryanna, an ta i imya nat ná ve au findelerya náne aucirna.
And if a woman does not cover herself, it is necessary for her to cut off her hair, but if is a humiliation for a woman to cut off her hair, it is necessary for her to cover herself.	An qui nís ua tope inse, mauya sen cire oa findelerya, mal qui nucumie ná nissen aucire findelerya, mauya sen tope inse.
For a man does not do well if he covers his head, for he is God's image and glory, but the woman is the man's glory.	An nér ua care mai qui topis carya, an náse Eruo emma ar alcar, mal i nís i nero alcar ná.
For man is not out of woman, but woman out of man;	An nér ua et nissello, mal nís et nerello;
futhermore, man was not created for the woman, but woman for the man.	ente, nér úne ontana i nissen, mal nís i neren.
Therefore for a woman is proper to have on her head a sign of power, for the good of the angels.	Etta nissen vanima ná same caryasse tanwa túreo, i valion máran.
Also, in the Lord woman is nothing except by man; in the same manner, man is nothing except by woman.	Yú, i Herusse nís munta ná hequa nernen; mí imya lé, nér munta ná hequa nissenen.
For as the woman is out of man, so the man as well exists by the woman; but all things are out of God.	An ve i nís et i nerello ná, sie yú i nér ea i nissenen, mal ilye nati nar et Erullo.
Judge for yourselves: Is it proper if a woman without cover prays to God?	Nama elden: Ma vanima ná qui nís pen tópo hyame Erunna?
Does not nature itself instruct you that if a man has long hair, that is to him a humiliation,	Ma nasse imma ua peanta len i qui nér same anda findele, ta sen nucumnie ná,
but if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her? For her hair is given to her as a veil.	mal qui nís same anda findele, nas alcar sen? An findelerya ná sen antana ve vaşar.
But if anyone wants strife, that is not our custom, or the custom of God's congregations.	Mal qui aiquen mere cos, ta ua haimelva, hya Eruo ocombion haime.
But giving these commands I do not praise you, for you do not come together for good, but for evil.	Mal antala canwar sine uan laita le, an ualde tule uo máran, mal ulcun.
Firstly, I hear that when you come together in the congration exist divisions among you, and in part I believe it.	Minyave, hlarin in íre tulilde uo i ocombesse ear hyarier mici le, ar mi ranta savinyes.
It is also necessary that there exist splits among you, in order to show who among you are trusty.	Yú mauya in ear şancier mici le, tanien man mici le nar sarte.
Therefore, when you come together in a single place, you do not come to eat the Lord's evening meal.	Etta, íre tulilde uo mir erya nóme, ualde tule matien i Heruo şinyemat.
For when you eat it, everyone has eaten his own evening meal beforehand, and one person is hungry, while another is drunk.	An íre matildes, ilquen amátie véra şinyematterya nóvo, ar er quén maita ná, lan exe limpunqua ná.
Do you not have houses in which it is possible for you to eat and drink? Or do you despise God's congregation, and humiliate who have nothing? What am I to say to you? Am I to praise you? In this matter I do not praise you.	Ma ualde same coar yassen ece len mate ar suce? Hya ma nattirilde Eruo ocombe, ar nucumir i samir munta? Mana quetuvan len? Ma laituvan le? Mi natto sina uan laita le.
For I received from the Lord what I also let you receive from me: that in the night when he was given over, the Lord Jesus took a bread,	An inye camne i Herullo ya yú láven elden came nillo: i mí lóme yasse anes antana olla, i Heru Yésus nampe massa,
and after he gave thanks, he broke it and said: “This is my body, which is being given in your behalf. Do this in remembrance of me.”	ar apa antanes hantale, ranceses ar quente: “Si ná hroanya, ya ná antaina rá len. Cara si enyalien ní.”
After the evening meal he did the same with the cup, saying: “This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, at every time that you drink it, in remembrance of me.”	Apa i şinyemat carnes i imya i yulmanen, quétala: “Yulma sina ná i vinya vére sercenyasse. Cara si, mi ilya lú ya sucildes, enyalien ní.”
For on every occasion that you eat this bread and drink this cup, you make known the death of the Lord, until he comes.	An mi ilya lú ya matilde massa sina ar sucir yulma sina, carilde sinwa i Heruo qualme, tenna tulis.
Thus everyone who eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord without being worthy, will carry guilt concerning the Lord's body and blood.	Sie ilquen ye mate i massa hya suce i Heruo yulma pen náve valda, coluva cáma pa i Heruo hroa ar serce.
It is necessary that a person tests himself, and thereafter he may eat of the bread and drink from the cup.	Mauya i quén tyasta inse, ar epeta lertas mate i masso ar suce i yulmallo.
For who eats and drinks without heeding the body, is eating and drinking judgement upon himself.	An ye mate ar suce pen cimie i hroa, máta ar súca námie insenna.
Therefore numerous ones among you are weak and sickly, and a sufficient number have died.	Etta rimbar mici le nar milye ar engwe, ar fárea nóte aquálier.
But if we gave heed to ourselves, we were not judged.	Mal au cimnelvexer, ualve náne námine.
But when we are being judged, we receive chastisement from the Lord, to stop us from being judged evil with the world.	Ono íre nalve námaine lo i Heru, camilve paimesta i Herullo, vi-pustien návello námine ulce as i mar.
Therefore, my brothers, when you come together to eat it, wait one for the other.	Etta, hánonyar, íre tulilde uo matien sa, á hope quén i exen.
If anyone is hungry, it is necessary for him to eat in his house, or you will come together for judgement. But as concerns the other matters I will give orders when I shall come there.	Qui aiquen maita ná, mauya sen mate coaryasse, hya tuluvalde uo námien. Mal pa i hyane nattor antauvan canwar íre tuluvan tar.
Now about the gifts of the spirit, brothers: I do not wish that you are to be ignorant.	#Sí pa i annar i faireo, hánor: Uan merin i nauvalde laistie.
You know that when you were of the nations, you were drawn away, being led to the dumb idols.	Istalde in íre anelde i nórion, anelde túcine oa, tulyaine i úpe cordonnar.
Therefore I wish that you know that nobody, when he is speaking by God's spirit, can say: “Jesus is accursed!”, and no one can say: “Jesus is Lord”, except by Holy Spirit.	Etta merin in istalde in úquen, íre quétas Eruo fairenen, pole quete: “Yésus húna ná!”, ar úquen pole quete: “Yésus Heru ná“, hequa Aire Feanen.
 exist numerous kinds of gifts, but the spirit is the same.	Ear rimbe nostalélion annar, mal i faire i imya ná.
 exist numerous kinds of servant-work , but the Lord is the same.	Ear rimbe nostalélion núromolie, mal i Heru i imya ná.
 exist numerous kinds of work, but the same God works everything in everyone.	Ear rimbe nostalélion molie, mal i imya Aino mole ilqua mi ilquen.
But the showing of the spirit is given to everyone for a beneficial purpose.	Mal i tanáve i faireva ná antana ilquenen aşea ennen.
To one person is given speech of wisdom, to another speech of knowledge, as the same spirit leads him;	Er quenen ná antana questa sailiéva, exen questa istyava, ve i imya faire tulya se;
to another, faith from the same spirit, to another, gifts of healing by the sole spirit,	exen, savie i imya fairello; exen, annar nestiéva i erya fairenen;
to another, working of wonders, to another, speaking as a Prophet, to another insight on the spirits, to another, kinds of tongues, to another, telling what tongues mean.	exen, molie elmendaiva, exen, quetie ve Erutercáno, exen, tercen i fairissen, exen, nostaler lambion, exen, nyarie mana lambi tear.
But all these things are being worked by the one and the same spirit, distributing them as it wishes to every person.	Mal ilye nati sine nar mólaine lo i er ar i imya faire, etsátala tai ve meris ilya quenen.
For just as the body is one, but has many parts, and all the bodyparts, though they are many, are a single body, so also is the Christ.	An aqua ve i hroa er ná, mal same rimbe rantali, ar ilye i hroarantar, ómu nalte rimbe, nar erya hroa, sie yú i Hristo ná.
For indeed by one spirit we were all baptized into one body – not heeding if we are Jews or Greeks, not heeding if we are thralls or free ones. And all among us received the same spirit to drink.	An é er fairenen anelve illi sumbane mir er hroa – lá címala qui nalve Yúrar hya Hellenyar, lá címala qui nalve móli hya lérar. Ar illi mici vi camner i imya faire sucien.
For the body indeed is not one part, but numerous ones.	An i hroa é ua er ranta, mal rimbe.
If the foot were going to say: “Since I am not a hand, I am not a part in the body”, it is not therefore outside of the body. 	Qui i tál quetumne: “Pan uan má, uan ranta mí hroa”, uas tanen ettesse i hravo.
And if the ear were going to say: “Since I am not an eye, I am not a part in the body”, it is not therefore outside of the body.	Ar qui i hlas quetumne: “Pan uan hen, uan ranta mí hroa”, uas tanen ettesse i hravo.
If the whole body were an eye, where the hearing ? If everything was hearing, where the sense of smell ?	Au i quanda hroa náne hen, masse i hlarie? Au ilqua náne hlarie, masse i nuste náne?
But now God has put the parts in the body – every single among them – just as he wanted.	Mal sí Eru apánie i rantar i hroasse – ilya erya mici tai – aqua ve mernes.
If all among them were one part, where the body ?	Au illi mici tai náner er ranta, masse i hroa?
But now they are many bodyparts, and yet one body.	Mal sí nalte rimbe hroarantali, ananta er hroa.
It is not possible for the eye to say to the hand: “Need of you I do not have,” or again the head to the feet : “Need of you I do not have.”	Lá ece i henden quete ana i má: “Maure lyéva uan same,” hya ata i cas ana i talu: “Maure letwa uan same.”
 is much more true that is a need for those body-parts that by their appearance are weak,	Ita ambe nanwa ná in ea maure tane hroarantaiva yar nemestaltanen nar milye,
and the body-parts that we think less honorable, to them we give that more abundant glory, and so our unseemly parts have more abundant beauty,	ar i hroarantar yar sanalve mis laitime, tain antalve ta ambe úvea alcar, ar sie úvanime rantalvain samir ambe úvea vaniesse,
while our comely parts have need of nothing. And yet God put together the body, giving glory more abundant to the deficient part,	lan vanime rantalvar samir maure muntava. Ananta Eru panyane uo i hroa, antala alcar ambe úvea i racina rantan,
in order to stop the body from being split, but it is necessary for its parts to heed the others like they heed themselves.	pustien i hroa návello şanca, mal mauya rantaryain cime i exi ve cimiltexer.
And if one part has pain, all the other parts have the same pain; or if one part receives glory, all the other parts have joy with it.	Ar qui er ranta same naice, ilye i hyane rantar samir i imya naice; hya qui er ranta came alcar, ilye i hyane rantar samir alasse as sa.
Now you are the Christ's body, and all among you are parts in the whole.	Sí elde nar i Hristo hroa, ar illi mici le nar rantar mí ilya.
And those that God has put in the congregation are, firstly, apostles, secondly, prophets, thirdly, teachers; then that do wonders, then gifts of healing, helping services , leading services, kinds of tongues.	Ar té i Eru apánie i ocombesse nar, minyave, aposteli, tatyave, Erutercánor, nelyave, peantari; tá i carir elmendar, tá annar nestiéva, manyala molier, tulyala molier, nostaler lambaiva.
Surely all are not apostles? Surely all are not prophets? Surely all do not do wonders?	Lau illi nar aposteli? Lau illi nar Erutercánor? Lau illi carir elmendar?
Surely all do not have gifts of healing? Surely all do not speak in tongues? Surely all do not have the gift of telling what the tongues mean?	Lau illi samir annar nestiéva? Lau illi quetir lambessen? Lau illi samir i anna nyariéva ya i lambi tear?
But seek the greater gifts with a burning spirit! And yet I show you a surpassing way.	Mal á cesta i ambe túre annar uryala şúlenen! Ananta tanan len lahtala tie.
If I speak in the tongues of men and angels, but I do not have love, I have been like a sounding piece of copper, or a cymbal making noise.	Qui quetin atanion ar valion lambessen, mal uan same melme, anaien ve lamyala mitta urusteva, hya tontilla carila ran.
And if I have the gift of speaking as a prophet, and I know all the secrets and all knowledge, and if I have faith to command mountains to move, but I do not have love, I am nothing.	Ar qui samin i anna quetiéva ve Erutercáno, ar istan ilye i fóli ar ilya istya, ar qui samin savie canien oronti leve, mal uan same melme, nanye munta.
And if I give all my goods as food for others, and if I give away my body for it to be burnt, but I do not have love, that is not beneficial for me at all.	Ar qui antan ilye armanyar ve matta exin, ar qui antan olla hroanya náveryan urtana, mal uan same melme, ta ua aşea nin aqua.
Love has patience and is gentle. Love does not have envy, it does not praise itself, it not haughty,	Melme same cóle ar moica ná. Melme ua same hrucen, uas laitaxe, uas turquima,
it does not behave in an unseemly manner, it does not seek its own things, it is not brought to anger. It does not keep a record of evil.	uas lenga mi úvanima lé, uas cesta véraryar, uas talana rúşenna. Uas hepe onotie ulcuva.
It does not have joy in injustice, but has joy with the truth.	Uas same alasse mi úfailie, mal samis alasse as i nanwie.
It bears everything, it believes everything, it has hope in everything, it endures everything.	Colis ilqua, savis ilqua, samis estel mi ilqua, perperis ilqua.
Love does not ever fall away. If they are words of prophets, they will be put away; if they are tongues, they will cease; if it is knowledge, it will be put away.	Melme ua oi lantuva oa. Qui nalte Erutercánoron quettar, nauvalte panyane oa; qui nalte lambi, hautuvalte; qui nas istya, nauvas panyana oa.
For our knowledge is in part, and we speak as prophets in part,	An istyalva mi ranta ná, ar quetilve ve Erutercánor mi ranta,
but when the perfect shall come, that which exists in part will be put away.	mal íre i ilvana tuluva, ta ya ea mi ranta nauva panyana oa.
When I was a babe, I spoke as a babe, I thought like a babe, I judged like a babe; but now that I am a man, I have put away the things of the babe.	Íre anen lapse, quenten ve lapse, sannen ve lapse, namnen ve lapse; mal sí íre nanye veo, apánien oa i lapseo nati.
Now we see as if in a mirror, obscurely, but then we shall see from face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall know fully, as I am also known.	Sí cenilve ve mi cilintilla, nullave, mal tá cenuvalve cendelello cendelenna. Sí istan mi ranta, mal tá istuvan aqua, ve nanye yú sinwa.
But now remain faith, hope, love – these three – but the greatest among them is love.	Ono sí lemyar savie, estel, melme – nelde sine – mal i antúra mici tai melme ná.
Pursue love, and yet with a burning spirit seek the gifts of the spirit , above all that you will be able to speak like prophets.	Á roita melme, ananta uryala şúlenen á cesta i annar i faireo, or ilqua i poluvalde quete ve Erutercánor.
For who speaks in a tongue speaks, not to men, but to God, for is no one listening, but he speaks secrets by the spirit.	An ye quete lambesse quete, lá Atannar, mal Erunna, an ea úquen lastala, mal quetis fóli i fairenen.
But who speaks as a prophet builds up and urges and comforts men with his speech.	Mal ye quete ve Erutercáno carasta ama ar horta ar tiuta atani questaryanen.
 who speaks in a tongue builds himself up, but who speaks as a prophet builds up a congregation.	Ye quete lambesse carasta inse ama, mal ye quete ve Erutercáno carasta ama ocombe.
I wish that all among you will speak in tongues, but is better if you will speak as prophets. that speaks as a prophet indeed is greater than that speaks in tongues – if he does not tell what his speech means, thus allowing the congregation to receive upbuilding.	Merin i illi mici le quetuvar lambessen, mal arya ná qui quetuvalde ve Erutercánor. Ye quete ve Erutercáno é ná túra lá ye quete lambessen – qui uas nyare mana questarya tea, sie lávala i ocomben came amacarastie.
But now, brothers, if I were going to come to you speaking in tongues, how was that beneficial for you if I am did not speak to you with a revelation or with knowledge or with the word of a prophet or with a teaching?	Mal sí, hánor, qui tulumnen lenna quétala lambessen, manen ta náne len aşea qui uan quente lenna apantiénen hya istyanen hya Erutercáno quettanen hya peantiénen?
If also things without life that give sound, like a harp or a flute, cannot make the musical sounds different, how will one know what is played with the flute or the harp?	Qui yando nati pen coivie yar antar lamma, ve ñande hya simpa, uar carir i lingi alavéle, manen mo istuva mana ná tyálaina i simpanen hya i ñandenen?
Indeed who will prepare himself for fighting if the trumplet gives an obscure sound?	É man manwaxe mahtien qui i hyóla anta nulla lamma?
In the same way you as well: If you do not with your tongue talk in a speech that people can understand, how will anyone know what is being said? Indeed you will speak into the air!	Mí imya lé yú elde: Qui ualde lambaldanen carpa mi questa ya queni istar hanya, manen aiquen istuva mana quétaina ná? É quetuvalde mir i vilya!
Although are many kinds of languages in the world, does not exist a single kind that means nothing.	Ómu ear rimbe nostalélion lambeler i mardesse, ua ea erya nostale ya tea munta.
If I do not know what the language means, I will be foreign to who speaks, and he will be foreign to me.	Qui uan ista ya i lambele tea, nauvan ettelea yen quete, ar isse nauva ettelea inyen.
So you as well, since with a burning spirit you want the gifts of the spirit: seek to have them in abundance, in order to build up the congregation.	Sie yú elde, pan uryala şúlenen merilde i faireo annar: á cesta samitat úvesse, carastien ama i ocombe.
Therefore it is necessary for the one who speaks in a tongue to pray that he will know tell what that means.	Etta mauya yen quete lambesse hyame in istuvas nyare ya ta tea.
For if I am praying in a tongue, my spirit is praying, but my mind does not give fruit.	An qui hyáman lambesse, fairenya hyáma, mal sámanya ua anta yáve.
What am I to do? I will pray by the spirit, but I will also pray with my mind.	Mana caruvan? Hyamuvan i fairenen, mal yú hyamuvan sámanyanen.
For if you give praise by spirit, how will the man that is sitting in the place of the ordinary person say “amen” when you give thanks, since he does not understand what you are saying?	An qui antalde laitale fairenen, manen i nér ye hára i şanya queno nómesse quetuva “násie” íre antalde hantale, pan uas hanya mana quétalde?
You indeed give thanks in a good manner, but the other man is not being built up.	Elde é antar hantale mi mára lé, mal i hyana nér ua carastaina ama.
I thank God, I speak in tongues more numerous than all among you speak !	Hantan Erun, quetin lambessen rimbe lá illi mici elde quetir!
And yet in the congreation I want to speak five words with my mind above ten thousand words in a tongue.	Ananta i ocombesse merin quete quettar lempe sámanyanen or quettar húmi quean lambesse.
Brothers, do not be children in understanding, but be babes in evil; and yet be perfect in understanding.	Hánor, áva na hínar handesse, mal na lapsi ulcusse; ananta na ilvane handesse.
In the Law is written: “With the tongues of strangers and with foreign people's lips I will speak to this people, and even then they will not listen to me, says the Lord.”	I Şanyesse técina ná: “Ettelearon lambínen ar ettelie quenion peunen quetuvan lie sinanna, ar yando tá ualte lastuva ninna, quete i Héru.”
Thus tongues are a sign, not to that believe, but to that do not believe; but speaking as a prophet is not for that do not believe, but for that believe.	Sie lambi nar tanwa, lá in savir, mal in uar save; ono quetie ve Erutercáno ua in uar save, mal in savir.
Therefore, if the entire congregation assembles in one place, and all among them speak in tongues, but people that lack knowledge or do not believe come in, will they not say that you are out of your mind?	Etta, qui i quanda ocombe ócome mi er nóme, ar illi mici te quetir lambessen, mal queni i penir istya hya uar save tulir minna, ma ualte quetuva i nalde ettesse sámaldo?
But if all among them speak like prophets, and a person who does not believe or who lacks knowledge comes in, he is being shamed by all, he is being examined by all,	Mal qui illi mici te quetir ve Erutercánor, ar quén ye ua save hya ye pene istya tule minna, náse naityaina lo illi, náse hentaina lo illi,
the secrets of his heart are being revealed, and so, falling upon his face, he will worship God and openly say: “God is indeed among you!”	endaryo fóli nar apantaine, ar sie, lantala cendeleryanna, tyeruvas Eru ar pantave quetuva: “Eru é ea mici elde!”
Then what are we to do, brothers? When you assemble, one person has a holy song, one person has a revelation, one person has a tongue, one person knows to tell what a tongue means. It is necessary that everything is to happen in order to build up.	Tá mana caruvalde, hánor? Íre ocomilde, quén same aire líre, quén same peantáve, quén same apantie, quén same lambe, quén istya nyare mana lambe tea. Mauya in ilqua martuva carastien ama.
And if people speak in tongues, it is necessary that they are not more than two or – as the highest permissible number – three. Let them speak one after the other, and it is necessary that there is a person who tells what their speech means.	Ar qui queni quetir lambessen, mauya in ualte rimbe lá atta hya – ve i anhalla lávima nóte – nelde. Alte quete quén apa i exe, ar mauya in ea quén ye nyare mana questalta tea.
But if there is not anyone to give the meaning, it is necessary for him to be silent in the congreation and speak to himself and to God.	Mal qui lá ea aiquen antáven i teale, mauya sen náve quilda i ocombesse ar quete insenna ar Erunna.
And let two or three prophets give their words, and let the others judge what they are saying.	Ar lava Erutercánoin atta hya nelde anta quettaltar, ar lava i exin name ya quétalte.
But if another receives a revelation while he is sitting there, it is necessary for the first one to be silent.	Mal qui exe came apantie íre hámas tasse, mauya i minyan náve quilda.
For you can speak as prophets one after one; thus all will be exhorted.	An polilde quete ve Erutercánor quén apa quén; sie illi nauvar hortane.
And it is necessary for the prophets to control their spirits.	Ar mauya i Erutercánoin ture faireltar.
For God is not a God whose paths are not arranged, but a God of peace.As in all congrations of the holy ones	An Eru ua Aino yó tier uar partane, mal Aino raineva. Ve ilye ocombessen i airion
it is necessary for the women to be silent in the congrations, for is not permitted to them to speak, but it is necessary that they are in subjection , as the Law also says.	mauya i nissin náve quilde i ocombessen, an ua lávaina tien quete, mal mauya i nalte nu túre, ve i Şanye yú quete.
But if they wish to learn something, it is necessary for them to ask their own husbands in the home, for speaking in the congration is a humilation for a woman.	Mal qui merilte pare nat, mauya tien maquete vére verultar i maresse, an quetie i ocombesse nucumnie ná nissen.
What? Was it from you God's word went out, or only as far as you it has reached?	Mana? Ma lello Eruo quetta etelende, hya rie tenna elde arahties?
If anyone thinks that he is a prophet or that he has the spirit, it is necessary for him to give heed to to the things that I am writing to you, for they are the Lord's command.	Qui aiquen sana i náse Erutercáno hya i samis i faire, mauya sen cime i nati yar técan lenna, an nalte i Heruo canwa.
But if anyone lacks knowledge, without knowledge he is.	Mal qui aiquen pene istya, ú istyo náse.
Therefore, brothers, with a burning spirit seek the gift of the prophet, and yet do not forbid the speaking in tongues.	Etta, hánor, uryala şulenen á cesta anna i Erutercánova, ananta áva váquete i quetie lambessen.
But may all these things happen in a proper and arranged manner.	Mal nai ilye nati sine martuvar mi vanima ar partana lé.
Now I made known to you, brothers, the gospel that I gave to you, which I also received, in which you also stand,	#Sí carin sinwa len, hánor, i evandilyon ya antanen len, ya yú camnelde, yasse yú tarilde,
by which you are saved, by the speech with which I made the gospel known to you, if you keep it – if you did not believe for nothing.	yanen nalde rehtane, i questanen yanen carnen i evandilyon sinwa len, qui hepildes – qui ualde sáver muntan.
For I gave over to you, among the first things, that which I also received, that Christ died for our sins as the Scripture says,	An antanen olla len, mici i minye nati, ta ya yú camnen, i Hristo qualle úcarilvain ve i Tehtele quete,
and that he was brought to his grave, and he has been raised up on the third day as the Scripture says,	ar in anes talana sapsaryanna, ar anaies ortana ama i neldea auresse ve i Tehtele quete,
and that he showed himself to Cephas, then to the twelve.	ar i tannesexe Céfan, tá i yunquen.
Thereafter he showed himself to more than five hundred brothers, of whom the greater number remain until this day, though some are dead.	Epeta tannesexe hánoin or tuxar lempe, ion i anhoa nóte lemyar tenna aure sina, ómu ennoli nar qualine.
Thereafter he showed himself to Jacob, then to all the apostles,	Epeta tannesexe Yácoven, tá ilye i apostelin,
but last of all he showed himself to me, as to a babe born before the time.	mal métima illion tannesexe yú inyen, ve lapsen nóna nó i lúme.
For I am the smallest of the apostles, and I am not worthy to be called an apostle, for I have persecuted God's congregation.	An nanye i ampitya i apostelion, ar uan valda náveo estaina apostel, an oroitien Eruo ocombe.
But by God's grace I am who I am. And the grace that he gave to me was not for nothing, but I labored more than them all, and yet not I, but God's grace that is in me.	Mal Eruo lissenen nanye ye nanye. Ar i lisse ya antanes nin úne muntan, mal mólen ambe lá te illi, ananta lá inye, mal Eruo lisse ya ea asinye.
But not heeding if I or they did the work, this is what we make known , and so you have believed.	Mal lá cimila qui inye hya té carner i molie, si ná ya carilme sinwa, ar sie asávielde.
Now if concerning the Christ is made known that he has been raised from dead, how is that are some among you that say that there is no resurrection from dead?	Sí qui pa i Hristo mo care sinwa in anaies ortana qualinallon, manen ná in ear ennoli mici elde i quetir i lá ea enortáve qualinallon?
If is no resurrection from the dead, Christ as well has not been raised.	Qui enortáve qualinallon lá ea, yú Hristo ua anaie ortana.
But if Christ has not been raised, what we make known is actually empty , and our faith is empty.	Mal qui Hristo ua anaie ortana, ya carilme sinwa anwave lusta ná, ar savielva lusta ná.
Furthermore, we are also found as lying witnesses against God, for we have witnessed against God that he raised the Christ, whom he did not raise if dead are not being raised.	Ente, nalve yú hírine ve hurila vettoli Erunna, an evettielve Erunna in ortanes i Hristo, ye uas ortane qui qualinar uar ortaine.
For if dead are not raised, the Christ as well has not been raised.	An qui qualinar uar ortaine, yú i Hristo lá anaie ortana.
Furthermore, if the Christ has not been raised, your faith is for nothing; you are still in your sins.	Ente, qui i Hristo lá anaie ortana, savielda muntan ná; nalde en úcarieldassen.
Indeed also that have died in Christ perished.	É yú i aquálier Hristosse váner.
If in this life alone we have put our hope in Christ, we are among all men the most worthy of pity .	Qui mi coivie sina erinqua apánielve estelelva Hristosse, nalve mici ilye atani i anvalde ofelmeo.
But the Christ has indeed been raised from dead, a first fruit of who have died.	Ono i Hristo é anaie ortana qualinallon, minya yáve ion aquálier.
For like death came through a man, also resurrection of dead is through a man.	An ve qualme túle ter atan, yú enortáve qualinaiva ter atan ná.
For like in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive.	An ve Atande illi qualir, sie yú Hristosse illi nauvar cárine coirie.
But everyone in his own time: Christ the first fruit, thereafter that are Christ at his coming,	Mal ilquen véra lúryasse: Hristo i minya yáve, epeta i nar Hristova tulesseryasse,
then the end, when he gives over the kingdom to God and to the Father, after he put an end to all power and might.	tá i metta, íre antas olla i aranie Erun ar i Ataren, apa metyanes ilya túre ar mehte.
For it is necessary for him to rule until God puts all enemies under his feet.	An mauya sen ture tenna Eru panya ilye ñottor nu taluryat.
As the last enemy death will be put an end to.	Ve i métima ñotto qualme nauva metyana.
For God “has put all things under his feet”. But when he says that all things have been put under his power, it is easy to see that he who put all things under him is not counted among them.	An Eru “apánie ilye nati nu taluryat”. Mal íre quetis in ilye nati anaier panyane nu túrerya, ná aşcénima in isse ye panyane ilye nati nu se ua nótina mici tai.
But when all things will be put under his power, then the Son himself will put himself under the power of that put all things under him, to make God everything for all.	Mal íre ilye nati nauvar panyane nu túrerya, tá i Yondo immo panyuvaxe nu i túre yeo panyane ilye nati nu se, carien Eru ilqua illin.
If not, what will they do who are baptized for dead? What is their reason for being baptized for them if dead will by no means be raised?	Qui lá, mana caruvar i nar sumbane qualinain? Mana castalta náven sumbane tien qui qualinar laume nauvar ortane?
Furthermore, what is our reason for putting ourselves in danger in every hour?	Ente, mana castalva panien inwe raxesse ilya lúmesse?
Every day I am dying – as true as it is possible for me to praise myself by means of you, brothers, in Christ Jesus our Lord.	Ilya auresse quálan – tambe nanwa síve ece nin laitaxe eldenen, hánor, mi Hristo Yésus Herulva.
If was in the manner of men that I have fought against wild beasts in Ephesus, how was that beneficial to me? If dead will not be raised up, let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we shall die!	Au náne mi atanion lé in amahtien verce celvannar Efesusse, manen ta náne aşea nin? Qui qualinar lá nauvar ortaine, alve mate ar suce, an enwa qualuvalve!
Do not be made to err: If one remains among bad people, good habits will be marred.	Áva na tyárine ranya: Qui mo termare mici ulce queni, máre haimi nauvar hastaine.
Attain keenness of perception in a just manner and do not sin, for are some that lack knowledge about God. I am talking to cause you to feel shame!	Ñeta laice mi faila lé ar áva úcare, an ear ennoli i penir istya pa Eru. Quétan tyarien le fele nucumnie!
But a person will say: “How will dead be raised? What will be the kind of bodies that they come in?”	Mal quén quetuva: “Manen qualinar nauvar ortane? Mana nauva i nostale hroaron yassen tuluvalte?”
O unintelligent person! which you sow is not made alive if it does not first die;	A úhanda quén! Ya reril ua carna coirea qui uas minyave quale;
and that which you sow is not the body that will exist, but a naked seed – perhaps of grain, perhaps of another kind of plant –	ar ta ya reril ua i hroa ya euva, mal helda erde – cé orio, cé hyana nostale laimo –
but God gives it a body just as is good in his eyes, and to every seed its own body.	ono Eru anta san hroa aqua ve mára ná henduryatse, ar ilya erden véra hroarya.
All flesh is not the same flash, but men have their kind, and is another kind in cattle, and another kind of flesh in birds, and another kind in fishes.	Ilya hráve ua i imya hráve, mal atani samir nostalelta, ar ea hyana nostale hráveo mi yaxir, ar hyana nostale hráveo mi aiwi, ar hyana nostale mi lingwi.
And there are heavenly bodies and bodies on earth, but the glory of the heavenly bodies is of another kind, and not of the same kind as the glory of the bodies on earth.	Ar ear meneldie hroar ar hroar cemende, mal i meneldie hroaron alcar hyana nostaleo ná, ar lá i imya nostaleo ve i alcar i hroaron cemende.
The sun's glory is of its own kind, and the Moon's glory is another, and the glory of stars is another; indeed star is not like another star in glory.	Anaro alcar véra nostaleryo ná, ar Işilo alcar exe ná, ar tinwion alcar exe ná; é tinwe ua ve hyana tinwe mi alcar.
Thus is also the resurrection of dead: It is sown in a destructible state; it is raised in a state beyond destruction.	Sie ná yú i enortáve qualinaiva: Nas rérina mi nancárima sóma; nas ortana mi sóma han nancarie.
It is sown without glory; it is raised in glory.	Nas rérina pen alcar; nas ortana alcaresse.
It is sown as a body of matter; it is raised as a body of spirit.	Nas rérina ve hroa ermava; nas ortana ve hroa faireva.
Thus is also written: “The first man, Adam, became a living creature.” The last Adam became a spirit giving life.	Sie yú ná técina: “I minya nér, Atan, olle coirea onna.” I métima Atan olle faire antala coivie.
And yet the first is not that which is of spirit, but that which is of matter; thereafter comes that which is of spirit.	Ananta i minya ua ta ya faireva ná, mal ta ya ermava ná; epeta tule ta ya faireva ná.
The first man is out of the earth and made of dust; the second man is out of heaven.	I minya atan et i cemello ná ar cárina astova; i attea atan ná et menello.
Like the person made of dust, thus are also that were made of dust, and like the heavenly person is, so are also that are heavenly.	Ve i quén cárina astova, sie nar yú i náner cárine astova, ar ve i meneldea quén ná, sie nar yú i nar meneldie.
And just as we have borne the image of the person made of dust, we shall also bear the heavenly person's image.	Ar aqua ve ocólielve i emma i queno carna astova, coluvalve yú i meneldea queno emma. TIL HIT
But I say, brothers: Flesh and blood cannot be heir of God's kingdom; furthermore, that which is destructible will not possess that which is beyond destruction.	Mal quetin, hánor: Hráve yo serce uat pole náve aryon araniéno Eruo; ente, ya nancárima ná ua haryuva ta ya han nancarie ná.
Behold! I am telling you a secret: All among us will not die, but all among us will be changed,	Yé! Nyáran len fóle: Illi mici vi uar qualuva, mal illi mici vi nauvar vistane,
in a single moment, in the twinkling of an eye, when the last trumpet shall be heard. For the trumpet will sound, and dead will be raised in a state beyond destruction, and we shall be changed.	mi erya lú, mi hendo tintilie, íre i métima hyóla nauva hláraina. An i hyóla lamyauva, ar qualinar nauvar ortane mi sóma han nancarie, ar elve nauvar vistane.
For is necessary that this destructible puts on itself a state beyond destruction, and is necessary for this mortal to put on itself an immortal state.	An mauya nancárima sinan panya insasse sóma nancarie pella, ar mauya fírima sinan panya insasse ilfirin sóma.
But when this mortal puts on itself an immortal state, then will occur the saying that is written: “Death has been undone forever!	Mal íre fírima sina panya insasse ilfirin sóma, tá martuva i quetie ya técina ná: “Qualme anaie nancarna tennoio!
Death, where your victory? Death, where is your sting?”	Qualme, masse apairelya? Qualme, masse nastalya?”
The sting of death is sin, but the power of sin is the Law.	I nasta qualmeva úcare ná, mal úcareo túre i Şanye ná.
But thanks to God, for he gives us the victory through Jesus Christ our Lord!	Mal hantale Erun, an antas ven i apaire ter Yésus Hristo Herulva!
Therefore, my brothers, be faithful, firm – always doing an abundance in the work of the Lord, knowing that your work is not for nothing in the Lord.	Etta, hánonyar, na voronde, tulce – illume carila úve mí Heruo molie, istala i molielda ua muntan i Herusse.
About the collection for the holy ones: As I commanded the congregations in Galatia, so you do as well!	Pa i hostie i airin: Tambe cannen i ocombin Alatiasse, síve yú elde cara!
May everyone among you, on every first day of the week, set aside money – the sum that it is possible for him to give. Thus, when I shall come, there will not be need to do collections then.	Nai ilquen mici le, ilya minya auresse i otsolo, satuva telpe – i nonwe ya ece sen anta. Sie, íre tuluvan, ua euva maure care hostier tá.
But when I shall come there, I will send the men of your choosing to Jerusalem with letters, to carry your gift.	Mal íre tuluvan tar, mentauvan cilmeldo neri Yérusalemenna arwe tecettaron, colien annalda.
If it is possible for me as well to go, they shall go with me.	Qui ecuva yú inyen lelya, lelyuvalte óni.
But I will come to you when I have gone through Macedonia – for by way of Macedonia that I shall come –	Mal tuluvan lenna íre eménien ter Maceronia – an tienen Maceronio tuluvan –
and with you I will perhaps remain, or I will stay through the winter. Then you will be able to send me on my way again, to where I can go.	ar aselde cé termaruvan, hya lemyuvan ter i hríve. Tá poluvalde menta ni tienyasse ata, yanna polin lelya.
For I do not want to meet you now, passing through your region, for I have the hope that I will stay with you for a longer time, if the Lord allows.	An uan mere vele le sí, lahtala ménalda, an samin i estel i lemyuvan aselde ter ambe anda lúme, qui i Heru lave.
But I stay in Ephesus until the Festival of Weeks ,	Mal lemyan Efesusse tenna Aşar Otsolaron,
for a great door to work has been opened, and are many that stand against me.	an hoa fenna molienna anaie latyana, ar ear rimbali i tarir ninna.
When Timothy shall come, see that he will be free of fear among you, for he is doing the Lord's work, as do I.	Íre Timoşeo tuluva, cena i nauvas léra ruciéno mici le, an cáras i Heruo molie, ve care inye.
Therefore allow no one to despise him. Send him on his journey in peace, for him to come to me, for I am waiting for him, with the brothers.	Etta lava úquenen nattire se. Áse menta lendaryasse rainesse, tulieryan ninna, an hópan sen, as i hánor.
Now about Apollos our brother: I urged him with many words to come to us, with the brothers, and yet his will was not to come now, but he shall come when it shall be possible for him.. Be awake, be firm in the faith, be manly, be mighty!	Sí pa Apollo hánolva: Hortanenyes rimbe quettalínen tule menna, as i hánor, ananta şelmarya úne tule sí, mal tuluvas íre ecuva sen. Na cuive, na tance i saviesse, na vie, na taure!
Cause all your affairs to happen in love.	Tyara ilye nattoldar marta melmesse.
Now I urge you, brothers: You know that the family of Stephanas is the first fruit in Achaia, and that they appointed themselves to be servants to the holy ones.	Sí hortan le, hánor: Istalde i nosserya Stefánas ná i minya yáve Acaiasse, ar i panyaneltexer náven núror i airin.
Thus it is necessary also for you to subject yourselves such people and all that work together and toil.	Sie mauya yú elden panya inde nu taiti queni ar illi i molir uo ar mótar.
But I am happy since Stephanus and Fortunatus and Achaicus are here, for though you are not with me, they have filled my need.	Mal nanye valima pan Stefánas ar Fortunáto ar Acaico nar sisse, an ómu elde uar asinye, té aquátier maurenya.
For they renewed my spirit and your spirit. Therefore receive such people well.	An ceutanelte fairenya ar fairelda. Etta cama taiti queni mai.
The congregation in Asia greets you. Aquila and Prisca, with the congregation, greet you sincerely in the Lord.	I ocombe Asiasse suila le. Aquila yo Prisca, as i ocombe, suilar le holmo i Herusse.
All the brothers greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss.	Ilye i hánor suilar le. Á suila quén i exe aire miquenen.
This is my, Paul's, greeting, by my own hand.	Sisse ea ninya, Paulo, suilie, véra mányanen.
If anyone does not love the Lord, may he be accursed! Maran atha!	Qui aiquen ua mele i Heru, nai nauvas húna! Maran ata!
May the grace of the Lord Jesus be with you!	Nai i Heru Yésuo lisse euva aselde!
May my love be with all among you in Christ Jesus.	Nai melmenya euva as illi mici le mi Hristo Yésus.
 which existed from the beginning, which we heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have beheld and our hands have felt concerning the word of life	Ya enge i yestallo, ya hlasselme, ya ecénielme hendulmanten, ya eyétielme ar málmat paltanet pa i quetta coiviéno
– indeed the life was revealed, and we have seen it and witness and tell you about the eternal life that was with the Father and was revealed to us –	– é i coivie náne apantaina, ar ecénielmes ar vettalme ar nyarilme len pa i oira coivie ya enge as i Atar ar náne apantaina men –
that which we have seen and we heard we are telling also to you, that also you will have a part with us. And our part is with the Father and with Jesus Christ his Son.	ta ya ecénielme ar hlasselme nyáralme yando len, i yando lé samuva ranta aselme. Ar menya ranta ná as i Atar ar as Yésus Hristo Yondorya.
And so we are writing these things, that our joy will be full.	Ar sie técalme nati sine, i alasselma nauva quanta.
And this is the message that we have heard from him and we are telling you, that God is light, and there is not at all darkness in him.	Ar si ná i menta ya ahlárielme sello ar nyáralme len, i Eru cala ná, ar mornie laume ea sesse.
If we say that we have a part with him, and yet we walk in the dark, we are lying and do not do the truth.	Qui quetilve i samilve ranta óse, ananta vantalve i morniesse, húralve ar uar care i nanwie.
But if we walk in the light as he is in the light, we have a part one with the other, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin.	Ono qui vantalve i calasse tambe sé ea i calasse, samilve ranta quén as i exe, ar i serce Yésus Yondoryo vi-sove ilya úcarello.
If we say that we do not have sin, we mislead ourselves and the truth is not in us.	Qui quetilve i ualve same úcare, útulyalve inwe ar i nanwie lá ea vesse.
If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.	Qui etequentalve úcarelvar, náse voronda ar faila apsenien ven úcarelvar ar vi-sovien ilya úfailiello.
If we say that we do not sin, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.	Qui quetilve i ualve úacárie, carilves hurindo, ar quettarya lá ea vesse.
My children, I am writing these things to you that you will not sin. And if anyone does sin, we have a helper with the Father: Jesus Christ, the Righteous .	Hinyar, técan lenna nati sine i ualde úcaruva. Ar qui aiquen é úcaruva, samilve şámo as i Atar: Yésus Hristo, i Faila.
And he is a covering sacrifice for our sins, and yet not for ours alone, but the whole world’s.	Ar náse tópala yanca úcarelvain, ananta lá venyain erinque, mal i quanda mardo.
And thus we have the knowledge that we know him: if we abide by his commandments.	Ar sie samilve i istya i istalve sé: qui himyalve axanyar.
 who says: ”I know him”, but by his commandments he does not abide, he is a liar, and the truth is not in such a person.	Ye quete: ”Istanyes”, mal axanyar uas himya, sé hurindo ná, ar i nanwie lá ea mi síte quén.
But anyone who abides by his words, in him the love of God is made perfect. By this we know that we are in him.	Mal aiquen ye himya quettarya, mi sé i melme Eruo ná carna ilvana. Sinen istalve i nalve sesse.
For the one who says that he is in him it is necessary to walk as he walked.	Yen quete i náse sesse mauya vantie ve sé vantane.
Beloved ones, I do not write to you a new commandment, but an old commandment that you had from the beginning. This old commandment is the word that you heard.	Meldar, uan tece lenna vinya axan, mal yára axan ya sámelde i yestallo. Yára axan sina ná i quetta ya hlasselde.
Again, I write to you a new commandment, which is true for him and for you, since the darkness is passing, and the true light is shining even now.	Ata, tecin lenna vinya axan, ya ná nanwa sen ar len, pan i mornie auta, ar i nanwa cala caltea yando sí.
 who says that he is in the light, and yet he hates his brother, is still in the darkness.	Ye quete i eas i calasse, ananta yeltas hánorya, ea en i morniesse.
 who loves his brother remains in the light, and in him there is nothing that causes anyone to fall.	Ye mele hánorya lemya i calasse, ar sesse ea munta ya tyare aiquen lanta.
But who hates his brother is in the darkness and walks in the darkness, and he does not know where he is going, for the darkness has made his eyes blind.	Mal ye yelta hánorya ea i morniesse ar vanta i morniesse, ar uas ista yasse ménas, pan i mornie acárie henyat cénelóre.
I am writing to you, children, because your sins are forgiven you by means of his name.	Técan lenna, híni, pan úcareldar nar apsénine len esseryanen.
I am writing to you, fathers, because you know who is from the beginning. I am writing to you, youths, because you have conquered the Wicked One. I am writing to you, children, because you know the Father.	Técan lenna, atari, pan istalde ye ea i yestallo. Técan lenna, nessar, pan orutúrielde i Olca. Técan lenna, híni, pan istalde i Atar.
I am writing to you, fathers, because you know who is from the beginning. I am writing to you, youths, because you are strong and God’s word remains in you, and you have conquered the Wicked One.	Técan lenna, atari, pan istalde ye ea i yestallo. Técan lenna, nessar, pan nalde polde ar Eruo quetta lemya lesse, ar orutúrielde i Olca.
Do not love the world or that are in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love for the Father is not in him,	Áva mele i mar hya yar ear i mardesse. Qui aiquen mele i mar, i melme i Atarwa lá ea sesse,
since everything that is in the world – the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride caused by wealth – is not of the Father, but of the world.	pan ilqua ya ea i mardesse – i hráveo maile ar i henduo maile ar i valate tyárina almanen – ui i Ataro, mal i mardo.
And the world passes away, and so does its lust, but who does God’s will remains forever.	Ar i mar auta, ar sie care mailerya, mal ye care Eruo indóme lemya tennoio.
My children, this is the last hour, and as you have heard that the Antichrist is coming, even now there are numerous Antichrists. Thus we know that this is the last hour.	Hinyar, si ná i métima lúme, ar ve ahlárielde i túla i Anahristo, yando sí ear rimbe Anahristoli. Sie istalve i si ná i métima lúme.
They went forth from us, but they were not of our kind, for if they were of our kind, they remained with us. But it happened so that would be shown that they are not all of our kind.	Etemennelte vello, mal úmelte nostalelvo, an qui anelte nostalelvo, lemyanelte aselve. Mal martanes i umne tanaina i umilte illi nostalelvo.
For you have an annointing from the Holy One; all among you have knowledge.	Ar lé samir livyale i Airillo; illi mici le samir istya.
I write to you, not because you do not know the truth, but because you know it, and because there is not lie that comes from the truth.	Tecin lenna, lá pan ualde ista i nanwie, mal pan istaldes, ar pan lá ea huru ya tule i nanwiello.
Who is the liar, if not who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the Antichrist, he that denies the Father and the Son.	Man ná i hurindo, qui lá ye lala i Yésus ná i Hristo? Si ná i Anahristo, sé ye lala i Atar yo i Yondo.
Everyone who lacks the Son also lacks the Father. who confesses the Son confesses also the Father.	Ilquen ye pene i Yondo yando pene i Atar. Ye etequenta i Yondo etequenta yando i Atar.
You, let which you have heard from the beginning remain in you. If which you have heard from the beginning remains in you, you too will remain in the Son and the Father.	Lé, lava yan ahlárielde i yestallo lemya lesse. Qui ya ahlárielde i yestallo lemya lesse, yando lé lemyuvar mí Yondo yo i Atar.
And this is the promise that he gave us: eternal life.	Ar si ná i vanda ya antanes ven: oira coivie.
These things I write to you concerning those who try to mislead you.	Nati sine tecin lenna pa i nevir útulya le.
And you – the annointment that you received from him remains in you, and you do not have need that anyone teaches you. For it teaches you about everything, and it is true and without lie. Like it has taught you, remain in him.	Ar lé – i livyale ya camnelde sello lemya lesse, ar ualde same maure i aiquen peanta len. An sá peanta len pa ilqua, ar nas nanwa ar pen huru. Ve sá peánie len, á lemya sesse.
And now, my children, you remain in him, that, when he shall be revealed, you will have freeness of speech and we shall not be shamed away from him at his coming.	Ar sí, hinyar, alde lemya sesse, i, íre nauvas apantaina, samuvalve lérie quetiéva ar lá nauvalve naityane oa sello tulesseryasse.
If you know that he is righteous, you know that everybody who does righteousness has been born by him.	Qui istalde i náse faila, istalde i ilquen ye care failie anaie nóna sénen.
Behold the kind of love that the Father has given us, that we were going to be called children of God, and that we are. Therefore the world does not know us, since it has not known him.	Yé i nostale melmeo ya i Atar ánie ven, i umnelve estaine Eruhíni, ar ta nalve. Etta i mar ua ista ve, pan sé uas isintie.
Beloved ones, now we are children of God, but still is not revealed what we will be. We know that when he shall be revealed we will be like him, and we shall see him as he is.	Meldar, sí nalve Eruhíni, mal en ua apantaina ya nauvalve. Istalve i íre sé nauva apantaina nauvalve ve sé, an cenuvalves ve náse.
And everybody who has this hope in him, purifies self as he is clean.	Ar ilquen ye same estel sina sesse, poita immo ve sé ná poica.
Everybody who does sin also does lawlessness, for sin is lawlessness.	Ilquen ye care úcare yando care şanyelórie, ar úcare ná şanyelórie.
And you know that he was revealed to take away sins, and is not sin in him.	Ar istalde i sé náne apaintaina mapien oa úcari, ar lá ea úcare sesse.
Everyone remaining in him does not sin, nobody who sins has either seen him or known him.	Ilquen lemyala sesse ua úcare; úquen ye úcare var ecénie se var isintie se.
My children, let nobody mislead you; who does righteousness is righteous, as he is righteous.	Hinyar, lava úquenen útulya le; ye care failie faila ná, tambe sé ná faila.
 who does sin is from the Devil, since the Devil has sinned from the beginning. For this reason the Son of God was revealed: to undo the deeds of the Devil.	Ye care úcare ho i Arauco ná, pan i Arauco úacárie i yestallo. Casta sinan i Eruion náne apantaina: nancarien i Arauco cardar.
Everyone who has been born from God does not do sin, since his seed remains in him, and he cannot sin, since he has been born from God.	Ilquen ye anaie nóna Erullo ua care úcare, pan erderya lemya sesse, ar uas pole úcare, pan anaies nóna Erullo.
The children of God and the children of the Devil are revealed by this: Everyone who does not do righteousness is not of God, also not who does not love his brother.	I híni Eruo ar i híni i Arauco nar apantaine sinen: Ilquen ye ua care failie ui Eruo, yando lá ye ua mele hánorya.
For this is the message that you have heard from the beginning: to have love one for the other,	An si ná i menta ya ahlárielde i yestallo: samie melme quén i exeva,
not like Cain, who was of the Wicked One and killed his brother. And what is the reason by which he killed him? Because his own deeds were evil, but his brother’s deeds righteous.	lá ve Cain, ye náne i Olco ar nahtane hánorya. Ar mana i casta yanen se-nahtanes? Pan vére cardaryar náner ulce, mal hánoryo cardar faile.
Do not feel wonder, brothers, if the world hates you.	Áva fele elmenda, hánor, qui i mar yelta le.
We know that we have passed from death to life, since we love the brothers. who does not love remains in death.	Istalve i oantielve ñurullo coivienna, pan melilve i hánor. Ye ua mele lemya ñurusse.
Everyone who hates his brother is a manslayer, and you not that is not manslayer who has eternal life remaining in him.	Ilquen ye yelta hánorya atannahtar ná, ar istalde i lá ea atannahtar ye same oira coivie lemyala sesse.
By this we know his love, because he gave his life for us, and is our debt to give our life for our brothers.	Sinen istalve melmerya, pan sé antane coivierya elven, ar ná rohtalva antie coivielva hánolvain.
But who is rich in this world and sees his brother having need, and yet he shuts the door of his compassion to him – how does God love remain in him?	Mal ye ná lára mar sinasse ar cene hánorya arwa maureo, ananta holtas i fenna ofelmeryo sen – manen Eruo melme lemya sesse?
My children, let us love, not by word or by tongue, but by deed and by truth.	Hinyar, alve mele, lá quettanen hya lambanen, mal cardanen ar nanwiénen.
By this we shall know that we are of the truth, and we shall set our heart at rest before him.	Sinen istuvalve i nalve i nanwiéno, ar panyuvalve endalva séresse epe se.
For if our heart accuses us, God is greater than our heart and knows all things.	An qui endalva ulquete ve, Eru ná túra lá endalva ar ista ilye nati.
Beloved ones, if your heart does not accuse us, we have freeness of speech before God,	Meldar, qui endalva ua ulquete ve, samilve lérie quetiéva epe Eru,
and anything that we request we receive from him, since we abide by his commandments and do that are good to his eyes.	ar aiqua ya arcalve camilve sello, pan himyalve axanyar ar carir yar nar máre henyant.
For this is his commandment, that we believe in the name of Jesus Christ his Son and love one another, as he commanded us.	Ar si ná axanya, i savilve mí esse Yésus Hristo Yondoryo ar melir quén i exe, ve cannes ven.
Furthermore, who abides by his commandment remains in him, and he himself in the other, and so we know that he remains in us, by the spirit that he gave us.	Ente, ye himya axanya lemya sesse, ar sé immo i exesse, ar sie istalve i lemyas vesse, i fairenen ya ven-antanes.
Beloved ones, do not believe in every spirit, but test the spirits to see if they are of God, for numerous false prophets have gone out into the world.	Meldar, áva save ilya fairesse, mal á tyasta i fairi cenien qui nalte Eruo, pan rimbe hurutercánoli eteménier mir i mar.
By this you know God’s spirit: Every spirit that confesses Jesus Christ come in the flesh is of God,	Sinen istalde Eruo faire: Ilya faire ye etequenta Yésus Hristo túlienwa i hrávesse ná Eruo,
but every spirit that does not confess Jesus Christ is not of God. And this is the Antichrist’s spirit, of which you heard that it was coming, and even now it is in the world.	mal ilya faire ye ua etequenta Yésus Hristo ui Eruo. Ar si ná i Anahristo faire, pa ya hlasselde i anes túlala, ar yando sí eas i mardesse.
You are of God, my children, and you have conquered them, since who is in you is greater than who is in the world.	Lé nar Eruo, hinyar, ar orutúrielde te, pan ye ea lesse ná túra lá ye ea i mardesse.
They are of the world; therefore they speak by the world’s manner, and the world listens to them.	Té nar i mardo; etta quetilte i mardo lénen, ar i mar lasta téna.
We are of God. who knows God listens to us; he who is not of God does not listen to us. Thus we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of lie.	Vé nar Eruo.Ye ista Eru lasta venna; ye ui Eruo ua lasta venna. Sie istalve i faire nanwiéno ar i faire huruo.
Beloved ones, let us love one another, since love is of God, and everyone who loves is born of God and knows God.	Meldar, alve mele quén i exe, pan melme ná Eruo, ar ilquen ye mele ná nóna Eruo ar ista Eru.
 who does not love does not know God, because God is love.	Ye ua mele ua ista Eru, pan Eru ná melme.
By this God’s love was revealed among us: God sent his only-born Son into the world, that we could have life by him.	Sinen Eruo melme náne apantaina imíca ve: Eru mentane ernóna Yondorya mir i mar, i pollelve same coivie sénen.
Love is revealed in this, not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins.	Melme ná apantaina mi si, lá i elve emélier Eru, mal i sé méle vé ar mentane Yondorya ve tópala yanca úcarelvain.
Beloved ones, if God has loved us so, our debt is that also we love one another.	Meldar, qui Eru vi-emélie sie, rohtalva ná i yando vé melir quén i exe.
No one has ever seen God. If we love one another, God remains in us and his love is made perfect in us.	Úquen oi ecénie Eru. Qui melilve quén i exe, Eru lemya vesse ar melmerya ná carna ilvana vesse.
By this we know that in him we remain, and he in us, because he has given us out of his spirit.	Sinen istalve i sesse lemyalve, ar sé vesse, pan ánies ven et faireryo.
And we have seen and have witnessed that the Father has sent his Son as Savior of the world.	Ar elve ecénier ar evettier i ementie i Atar Yondorya ve Rehtando i mardo.
Anyone who confesses that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, in him God remains, and he in God.	Aiquen ye etequenta i Yésus Hristo i Eruion ná, sesse Eru lemya, ar sé Erusse.
And you know and have believed the love that God has for us.God is love, and who remains in love remains in God, and God remains in him.	Ar elve istar ar asávier i melme ya Eru same elveva.Eru ná melme, ar ye lemya melmesse lemya Erusse, ar Eru lemya sesse.
Thus love is made perfect with us, that we will have freedom of speech on the day of doom. For as he is, so also we are in this world.	Sie melme ná carna ilvana aselve, i samuvalve lérie quetiéva i auresse anamo. An tambe sé ná, sie yando elve nar i mar sinasse.
There is no fear in love, since perfect love throws fear out, because fear carries punishment with itself. who fears is not made perfect in love.	Lá ea caure melmesse, mal ilvana melme hate caure etsenna, pan caure cole paime as imma. Ye ruce ui carna ilvana melmesse.
We love, since he loved us first.	Elve melir, pan sé méle vé minyave.
If anyone says: ”I love God”, and yet he hates his brother, he is a liar. For who does not love his brother whom he has seen, cannot love God whom he has not seen.	Qui aiquen quete: ”Melin Eru”, ananta yeltas hánorya, sé hurindo ná. An ye ua mele hánorya ye ecénies, ua pole mele Eru ye uas ecénie.
And this commandment we have from him, that is necessary to who loves God to love also his brother.	Ar axan sina samilve sello, i mauya yen mele Eru mele yando hánorya.
Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God, and everyone who loves the Father will love who was born by him.	Ilquen ye save i Yésus ná i Hristo ná nóna Eruo, ar ilquen ye mele i Atar meluva ye náne nóna sénen.
By this we know that we love the children of God, when we are loving God and are doing his commandments.	Sinen istalve i melilve i Eruhíni, íre mélalve Eru ar cárar axanyar.
For this is the love for God, that we abide by his commandments. And his commandments are not burdensome,	An si ná i melme Eruva, i himyalve axanyar. Ar axanyar umir lumne,
since everything that is born of God conquers the world. And this is the victory that has conquered the world: our faith.	pan ilqua ya ná nóna Eruo orture i mar. Ar si ná i apaire ya orutúrie i mar: savielva.
Who is who conquers the world if not who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?	Man ná ye orture i mar qui lá ye save i Yésus ná i Eruion?
This is who came by water and blood, Jesus Christ, not by the water alone, but by the water and by the blood. And the spirit is what is witnessing, since the spirit is truth.	Si ná ye túle nennen ar sercenen, Yésus Hristo, lá i nennen erinqua, mal i nennen ar i sercenen. Ar i faire ná ya vettea, pan i faire nanwie ná.
For are three that bear witness,	An ear nelde yar vettar,
the spirit and the water and the blood, and these three are one.	i faire ar i nén ar i serce, ar nelde sine nar er.
If we receive the witness of men, God’s witness is greater. For this is the witness of God, that he has witnessed about his Son.	Qui camilve i vettie Atanion, Eruo vettie ambe túra ná. An si ná i vettie Eruo, i evetties pa Yondorya.
 who believes in the Son of God possesses the witness within himself. who does not believe in God has made him a liar, since he has not believed the witness that he has given about his Son.	Ye save mí Eruion harya i vettie immosse. Ye ua save Erusse acárie se hurindo, pan uas asávie i vettie ya sé ánie pa Yondorya.
And this is the witness, that God gave us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.	Ar si ná i vettie, i Eru antane ven oira coivie, ar coivie sina ea Yondoryasse.
 who has the Son has the life; who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.	Ye same i Yondo same i coivie; ye ua same i Eruion ua same i coivie.
I write these things to you that you will know that you have eternal life, you who believe in the name of the Son of God.	Tecin lenna nati sine i istuvalde i samilde oira coivie, lé i savir mí esse i Eruiono.
And this is the freeness of speech that we have towards him, that if we ask for anything according to his will, he hears us.	Ar si ná i lérie quetiéva ya savilve senna, i qui arcalve aiqua ve indómerya, hlaris ve.
Furthermore, if we know that he hears us about anything that we ask for, we know that we shall have the asked for, since we have asked them from him.	Ente, qui istalve i hlaris ve pa aiqua ya arcalve, istalve i samuvalve i arcainar, pan arcanielvet sello.
If anybody sees his brother do a sin that does not lead to death, he shall make request, and God will give him life – if he is not among the people whose sin leads to death. is a sin that leads to death; I do not say that one is to make request concerning that.	Qui aiquen cene hánorya cára úcare ya ua tulya qualmenna, arcuvas, ar Eru antuva sen coivie – qui uas mici queni ion úcare tulya qualmenna. Eä úcare ya tulya qualmenna; uan quete i mo arcuva pa ta.
All lawlessness is sin, and yet there is sin that does not lead to death.	Ilya şanyelórie úcare ná, ananta ea úcare ya ua tulya qualmenna.
We know that anyone born of God does not sin, but the One who was born of God abides by him, and the Wicked One does not touch him.	Istalve i aiquen nóna Eruo ua úcare, mal i Quén ye náne nóna Eruo himya se, ar i Olca ua appa se.
We know that we are of God, but the whole world lies in the power of the Wicked One.	Istalve i nalve Eruo, mal i quanda mar caita i túresse i Olco.
And we know that the Son of God has come, and he has given us understanding to know him who is true, and we are in who is true, by his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life.	Ar istalve i utúlie i Eruion, ar ánies ven hande istien sé ye şanda ná, ar ealve yesse şanda ná, Yondorya Yésus Hristonen. Sé ná i nanwa Aino ar oira coivie.
My children, keep yourselves from idols!	Hinyar, hepa inde cordonillon!
Peter, apostle of Jesus Christ, to the exiles scattered in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia – to the chosen ones	Péter, Yésus Hristo apostel, i etyannar vintaine mi Pontus, Alatia, Capparocia, Ásia ar Viºinia – i cílinnar
that were known beforehand by God the Father, by sanctification by the spirit, by their doing according to God's will and for them to be purified by the blood of Jesus Christ: May you have grace and peace in abundance!	i náner sinwe nóvo lo Eru i Atar, airitiénen lo i Faire, carieltan ve Eruo indóme ar náveltan poitaine Yésus Hristo sercenen: Nai samuvalde Erulisse ar raine úvesse!
Blessed be God, the Father of Jesus Christ our Lord, for by his great grace he has given us a new birth to a living hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,	Aistana na Eru, Yésus Hristo Herulvo Atar, an túra óravieryanen ven-antanes vinya nónie coirea estelenna i enortiénen Yésus Hristova qualinillon,
to an inheritance that is not stained or fading. It is reserved in heaven for you	aryonienna ya ua vahtaina hya fífírula. Nas sátina menelde len
that are protected by God's power, by faith, for a salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last time.	i nar varyaine lo Eruo túre, saviénen, rehtien ya ná manwa náven apantaina i métima lúmesse.
By means of this even now you have great joy, though in this time, if there is need, you have grief in this or that testing.	Sinen yando sí samilde túra alasse, ómu mi lúme sina, qui ea maure, samilde nyére mi sina hya tana tyastie.
Thus your tested faith, far more valuable than gold that is corruptible though it is tested by fire, will be found a cause of praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ.	Sie tyastaina savielda, mirwa ambela malta ya ná hastima ómu nas tyastaina nárenen, nauva hírina ve casta laitaleo ar alcaro ar laitiéno i apantiesse Yésus Hristova.
You did not ever see him, and yet you love him. You do not look at him now, and yet you believe in him and have a joy glorious beyond words,	Ualde oi cenne se, ananta melildes. Ualde yéta se sí, ananta savilde sesse ar samir alasse alcarinqua han quettar,
since you are receiving the goal of your faith, the salvation of your souls.	pan cámalde i met savieldo, i rehtie fealdaivar.
Concerning this salvation the Prophets sought and inquired, who spoke predictions of the grace that you were going to receive.	Pa rehtie sina i Erutercánor cestaner ar cenºer, i quenter apacelli i Erulisseo ya elde camumner.
They tried to understand what is the time that the Spirit in them indicated for the Christ, when it witnessed beforehand about Christ's torments and the glories that were going to come after them.	Névelte hanya mana náne i lúme ya i Faire tesse tenge i Hriston, íre vettanes nóvo pa Hristo ñwalmi ar i alcari yar tulumner apa tai.
 was revealed to them that not to themselves, but to you, they were servants of the things that now are preached to you by that brought to you the gospel, by Holy Spirit sent from heaven. These things angels want to inquire into!	Náne tien apantaina i lá inten, mal elden, anelte núror i nation yar sí nar nyardaine len lo i tuluner lenna i evandilyon, Aire Feanen mentaina menello. Nati sine vali merir ceºe!
Therefore fully keep your keenness of perception, by keeping your mind prepared. Have hope in the grace which will be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.	Etta aqua hepa laicelda, hepiénen sámalda manwaina. Sama estel mí Erulisse ya nauva tulúna lenna i apantiesse Yésus Hristova.
Like obedient children, do not be shaped according to the desires that you formerly had, when you lacked knowledge.	Ve canwacimye híni, áva na cátine ve i íri yar yá sámelde, íre pennelde istya.
But, by the will of the Holy One who called you, be also you holy in all your doings,	Mal, indómenen i Aireo ye le-yalle, na yando elde airi ilye carieldassen,
for is written: «It is necessary for you to be holy, since I am holy.»	an ná técina: «Mauya len náve airi, pan inye aire ná.»
Furthermore, if you are calling to the Father who does not heed who anyone is, but judges as everyone's work is, behave with fear while you dwell as exiles.	Ente, qui yálalde i Atarenna ye ua cime man aiquen ná, mal name ve ilqueno mótie ná, á lenga ruciénen íre marilde ve etyali.
For you know that you were not saved from fruitless behavior by means of corruptible things, by means of silver or by means of gold.	An istalde i únelde rehtaine yávelóra lengiello hastime natalínen, telpenen hya maltanen.
On the contrary, you were saved with precious blood, like that of a lamb without stain or spot – Christ's blood.	Úsie, anelte rehtaine mirwa sercenen, ve ta euleo ú vaxeo hya mordo – Hristo serce.
Indeed he was known beforehand before the founding of the world, but he was revealed at the end of times for your good,	É anes sinwa nóvo nó i tulcie i mardeva, mal anes apantaina i mettasse lúmion márieldan,
you that by him believe in God, who raised him from dead and gave him glory, for you to put your faith and your hope in God.	lé i sénen savir Erusse, ye ortane se qualinillon ar antane sen alcar, panieldan savielda ar estelelda Erusse.
After cleansing your souls by heeding the truth, which gives brotherly love without hypocrisy, love one another profoundly from the heart.	Apa poitie fealdar cimiénen i nanwie, ya anta hánonilme ú etyanetiéno, mela quén i exe tumnave i endallo.
For a new birth is given to you, not by corruptible but by incorruptible seed, by the word of the living and lasting God.	An vinya nónie ná len antaina, lá hastima mal alahastima erdenen, coirea ar vórea Eruo quettanen.
For «all flesh is like grass, and all its glory is like the flower of the grass; the grass withers, and the flower falls away,	An «ilya hráve ná ve salque, ar ilya alcarerya ná ve salqueo lóte; i salque hesta, ar i lóte lanta oa,
but the Lord's saying remains forever.» And this is the saying, the gospel preached to you.	mal i Héruo quetie lemya tennoio.» Ar si ná i quetie, i evandilyon nyardaina len.
Therefore put away all evil and all falsehood and all envies and all harsh answers.	Etta á panya oa ilya ulco ar ilya ñaunie ar ilye hrúceni ar ilye narace hanquentar.
As newborn babies long for the uncorrupt milk of the word, for you to grow into salvation,	Ve vinyanóne lapsar á milya i alahasta ilin i quettava, alieldan mir rehtie,
if you have tasted the Lord's goodness.	qui atyávielde i Heruo márie.
When you come to him, to the rock that was turned away by men, but is chosen and precious to God,	Íre tulilde senna, i ondonna ya náne quérina oa lo atani, mal ná cílina ar mirwa Erun,
you as well are built up as living stones, making a building of spirit, as a holy priesthood, to sacrifice sacrifices of spirit that God wants to receive, through Jesus Christ.	yando elde nar carastaine ama ve coirie ondoli, cárala ataque faireva, ve aire airimosse, yacien yancar faireva yar Eru mere came, ter Yésus Hristo.
For as the Scripture says: «Behold, I put in Sion a chosen stone, a founding corner-stone, precious, and anyone who believes in it shall by no means be shamed.»	An ve i Tehtele quete: «Yé, panyan Sionde cílina ondo, tulcala vincondo, mirwa, ar aiquen ye save sasse laume nauva naityana.»
Therefore he is precious to you who believe, but to those who do not believe, «the same stone that the builders turned away is now head of the corner»,	Etta náse mirwa len i savir; mal in uar save, «i imya ondo ya i ºamnor querner oa ná sí cas i vinco»,
and «a stone of slipping and a stone causing people to fall». They fall because they do not heed the word; so they have been destined.	ar «sar taltiéva ar ondo tyárala queni lanta». Lantalte pan ualte cime i quetta; sie anaielte martyaine.
But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a precious people, for you to be heralds of the goodness of who called you out of darkness into his light of wonder.	Mal elde nar cílina nosse, arna airimosse, aire nóre, mirwa lie, náveldan tercánoli i máriéno yeo le-yalle et morniello mir calarya elmendava.
For there was a time that you were not a people, but now you are God's people; you were the ones that did not receive mercy, but now you are who have indeed received mercy.	An enge lúme ya únelde lie, mal sí nalde Eruo lie; anelde i uar camne óravie, mal nalde sí i é acámier óravie.
Beloved ones, I urge you as exiles and people that dwell in foreign lands: Keep yourselves from the lusts of the flesh, that make war against the soul. Behave well among the nations!	Meldar, hortan le ve etyali ar quelli i marir ettelie nóressen: Hepa inde i hráveo mailellon, yar ohtacarir i feanna.
Then who now speak evil of you, as of evildoers, will be witnesses of your good deeds, and will give glory to God on the day that he examines them.	Á lenga mai imíca i nóri! Tá i sí quetir ulco pa le, ve pa ulcarindor, nauvar astarmor máre cardaldaron, ar antuvar alcar Erun i auresse ya ceºis te.
For the good of the Lord put yourselves under every creation of men – perhaps under the king, as a superior person,	I Heruo márien á panya inde nu ilya ontie atanion – cé nu i aran, ve inga quén,
perhaps under governors sent from him to punish who do evil, but to praise who do good.	cé nu cánor mentaine sello pamietien i carir ulco, mal laitien i carir márie.
For this is God's will: By doing good stop the witless talk of people that lack knowledge!	An si ná Eruo indóme: Cariénen márie á pusta i úhandea carpie quenion i penir istya!
Be like free people, but use your freedom, not to hide evil, but as God's slaves.	Na ve lére queni, mal á yuhta lérielda, lá nurtien ulco, mal ve Eruo móli.
Give glory to all, love the brotherhood, fear God, give glory to the king!	Á anta alcar illin, mela i otornasse, ruca Erullo, á anta alcar i aranen!
Let servants put themselves under their lords with all fear, not under the good ones and the gentle ones alone, but also under the difficult ones.	Nai núror panyuvar inte nu herultar ilya caurenen, lá nu i mani ar i moicar erinque, mal yando nu i hrangar.
For it is a beautiful thing if a person, perceiving what is his debt to God, endures griefs and has difficulty unjustly.	An ná vanima nat qui quén, tuntala mana rohtarya Erun, perpere nyéri ar same urdie úfailave.
For if, after sinning, you are beaten and you endure it, how is that praiseworthy? But if you have difficulty when you do good, and you endure it, that is a beautiful thing to God.	An qui, apa úcarie, nalye palpaina ar perperilyes, manen ta ná laitima? Mal qui samil urdie íre caril márie, ar perperilyes, ta ná vanima nat Erun.
To this thing you were indeed called, for also Christ endured torments for you, for you to follow behind him in his path.	Nat sinanna é anelde yáline, an yando Hristo perpére ñwalmeli elden, hilieldan ca se tieryasse.
He did not do sin, and lie was not found in his mouth.	Uas carne úcare, ar huru úne hírina antoryasse.
When others spoke to him with scorn, he did not speak with scorn to them. When he was tormented, he did not threaten, but put his case before who judges justly.	Íre exeli caramper senna yaiwenen, uas carampe yaiwenen téna. Íre anes ñwalyaina, uas ordane, mal panyane nattorya epe ye name failave.
He bore our sins in his own body on the cross, for us to move beyond sins and for us to have life by righteousness. For «by his wounds you were healed».	Sé colle úcarelvar véra hroaryasse i tarwesse, levielvan han úcari ar samielvan coire failiénen. Ar «nahteryainen anelde nestaine».
For you were like sheep, straying; but now we have returned to who oversees our souls.	An anelde ve mámar, ranyala; mal sí enutúlielve i mavarenna ye ortire fealvar.
In the same manner, let the women that have married subject themselves to their husband. Thus, if any people do not heed the word, maybe they will be gained without a word, by the conduct of their wives,	Mi imya lé, nai i nissi i evérier panyuvar inte nu verulta. Sie, qui aiqueni uar cime i quetta, cé nauvalte ñétine ú quetto, veriltaron lengiénen,
after watching your pure conduct and the awe that you show.	apa tirie poica lengielda ar i áya ya tanalde.
And do not adorn yourselves on the outside, by arrangements of hair, or by putting trinkets of gold on yourselves, or by carrying raiments,	Ar áva netya inde i ettesse, partiénen findeléva, hya paniénen neteli maltava indesse, hya coliénen larmar,
but adorn yourselves with the hidden person of the heart, with the incorruptible raiment of the the quiet and gentle soul, which is most precious in God's eyes.	mal á netya inde i endo nulda quennen, i quilda ar moica feo alahastima larmanen, ya ná ammirwa Eruo hendusse.
For so also the holy women that had hope in God adorned themselves, subjecting themselves to their husbands,	An sie yando i airi nissi i sámer estel Erusse netyaner inte, panyala inte nu verultar,
like Sarah did what Abraham said, calling him lord. And you have been made Sarah's children, if you do good and are not timid about anything fearful.	ve Sara carne ya Avraham quente, estala se heru. Ar elde anaier cárine Saro híni, qui carilde márie ar uar caurie pa aiqua rúcima.
You husbands, dwell with your wives with understanding, giving them glory as to a weaker vessel, the feminine, since you are also heirs with them to the grace of life – or your prayers will be hindered.	A veruvi, mara as verildar handenen, antala tien alcar ve ambe milya venen, i inya, pan nalde yando aryoni aselte i Erulisseo coiviéva – hya hyamieldar nauvar hampe.
Finally, be of a single mind and have sympathy, having love for your brothers and a warm heart, humbling yourselves.	Teldave, á na erya sámo ar sama ofelme, arwe melmeo hánoldaiva ar lauca endo, nucúmala inde.
Do not pay back with evil for evil or with harsh words for harsh words; on the contrary, you are to bless, for to this thing you have been called, for you to be heirs of a blessing.	Áva nampaitya ulcunen ulcun hya narace quettainen narace quettain; úsie, alde aista, an nat sinanna anaielde yáline, náveldan aistiéno aryoni.
For «who wants to love life and see good days, may he keep his tongue from evil and his lips from speaking a lie,	An «ye mere mele coivie ar cene máre aureli, nai hepuvas lambarya ulcullo ar péryat quetiello huru,
but let him turn himself from evil and do good; may be seek peace and pursue it!	mal lava sen quere inse ulcullo ar care márie; nai cestuvas raine ar roituva sa!
For the eyes of the Lord are turned against just ones, and his ears to their petitions, but the Lord has set his face against who do evil things .»	An i Héruo hendu nát quérine failannar, ar hlaryat arcandeltanna, mal i Héru apánie cendelerya ana i carir ulqui.»
For who is the person who will do evil to you if you burn for which is good?	Ar man ná i quén ye caruva ulco len qui uryalde yan mára ná?
But if you will indeed have difficulty because of doing good, happy you are! Do not fear from them, and do not be terrified,	Ono qui é samuvalde urdie carieldanen márie, valime nalde! Ávalde ruce tello, ar áva na ruhtaine,
but you sanctify the Christ as Lord in your heart. Always have your answer ready for everyone who demands a reason for the hope that dwells in you, but do so in a mild manner and having awe .	mal alde airita i Hristo ve Heru endaldasse! Illume sama hanquentalda manwa ilquenen ye cane casta i estelen ya mare lesse, ono cara sie mi milya lé ar arwe áyo.
Keep your conscience clean! . Thus, when you receive hostile words, the people that speak evil about your good behavior in Christ will be shamed.	Hepa immotuntielda mára! Sie, íre camilde cotye quettali, i queni i quetir ulco pa mára lengielda Hristosse nauvar naityaine.
For having difficulty since you are doing good, if God's will wishes it, is to you better than having difficulty since you are doing evil.	An samie urdie pan cáralde márie, qui Eruo indóme mere sa, ná len arya epe samie urdie pan cáralde ulco.
Christ as well died a single time concerning sins, a righteous person on behalf of unrighteous ones, for it to be possible for him to bring you to God, after he saw death in the flesh, but was made alive by the spirit.	Yando Hristo qualle erya lú pa úcari, faila quén rá úfailain, ecien sen le-tulya Erunna, apa cennes qualme i hrávesse, mal náne carna coirea i fairenen.
Thus he also went away and preached to the spirits in custody,	Sie yando oantes ar nyardane i fairennar mandosse,
that did not heed their orders when God in his patience waited in the days of Noah, in the building of the ark, in which some few, that is, eight persons, were carried in safety through the water.	i uar cimne canwaltar íre Eru cóleryasse lartane Nóho auressen, i carastiesse i marciryava, yasse mancali, tá ná, queni tolto, náner cóline mi varnasse ter i nén.
What answers to this, baptism, now saves you. It does not put away the filth of the flesh, but it is a petition to God about a good conscience , by the resurrection of Jesus Christ.	Ya hanquete ana si, tumyale, sí rehta lé. Uas panya oa i hráveo soa, mal nas arcande Erunna pa mára immotuntie, i enortiénen Yésus Hristova.
He is sitting by God's right hand, for he went away to heaven, and angels and authorities and powers have been put under him .	Háras ara Eruo forma, an oantes menelenna, ar vali ar héri ar túri anainer panyaine nu se.
Therefore, since the Christ was tormented in the flesh, take as your weapon the same kind of mind – for who has had grief in the flesh is beyond sins. Thus he can use the time that remains of his life in the flesh, no more for the wishes of men, but for God's will.	Etta, pan i Hristo náne nwalyaina i hrávesse, mapa ve carmalda i imya nostale sámo – an ye asámie nyére i hrávesse ná han úcari. Sie polis yuhta i lúme ya lemya coivieryo i hrávesse, lá ambe atanion írin, mal Eruo indómen.
For you have had sufficient time in the past having such a life that people of the nations choose, walking in loose behavior, in lust, drinking wine in abundance, having wild parties, overdrinking, and worshiping idols.	An asámielde fárea lúme i vanwiesse arwe taite coiviéno ya queni i nórion cilir, vantala lehta lengiesse, mailesse, súcala limpe úvesse, arwe hravani merendion, accasúcala, ar tyérala cordoni.
Now they are filled with wonder, since you do no more run with them in this stream of filthy behavior, and they talk to you with scorn.	Sí nalte quátine elmendanen, pan ualde ambe nore aselte celume sinasse vára lengiéva, ar carpalte lenna yaiwenen.
But these people will answer concerning this to that is ready to judge the living and the dead.	Mal queni sine hanquetuvar pa si yen ná manwa namien coirear ar qualini.
Therefore the gospel was brought also to dead ones, for them to be judged in the flesh, in the manner of Men, but for them to have life in the spirit, in the manner of God.	Etta i evandilyon náne tulúna yando qualinnar, náveltan námine i hrávesse, mi Atanion lé, mal samieltan coivie i fairesse, mi Eruo lé.
But the end of all things has come near. Therefore be in health of mind and keep your keenness of perception, in order to pray.	Mal ilye nation metta utúlie hare. Etta na málesse sámo ar hepa laicelda, hyamien.
Above all things, love one another with a profound love, since love covers a host of sins.	Or ilye nati, mela quén i exe tumna melmenen, pan melme tupe liyúme úcariva.
Receive others into your houses, not grumbling.	Cama exeli mir coaldar, lá nurrula.
Since everyone among you has received a gift, use it while you serve one another, in various graces.	Pan ilquen mici le acámie anna, ása yuhta íre veuyalde quén i exe, mí alavéle Erulissi.
If anyone speaks, may he speak as if his sayings were God's words. If anyone serves, may he serve as if by the strenght that God gives; thus Gud will receive glory in all things, by Jesus Christ, who has the glroy and the might forever and ever. Amen!	Qui aiquen quete, nai quetuvas ve qui quetieryar náner Eruo quettar. Qui aiquen veuya, nai veuyuvas ve i poldorénen ya Eru anta; sie Eru camuva alcar ilye natissen, Yésus Hristonen, ye same i alcar ar i melehte tennoio ar oi. Násie!
Beloved ones, do not be in wonder about the fire that happens among you to test you, as if a strange thing has happened to you.	Meldar, áva na elmendasse pa i ruive ya marta mici le tyastien le, ve qui ettelea nat amartie len.
On the contrary, have joy since you have a part in the torments of the Christ, for you to be happy beyond measure also at the revelation of his glory.	Úsie, sama alasse pan samilde ranta i Hristo ñwalmessen, náveldan valime han lesta yando i apantiesse alcareryava.
If you receive scorn because of Christ's name, happy you are, since the spirit of glory, indeed the spirit of God, lies upon you!	Qui camilde yaiwe Hristo essenen, valime nalde, pan i faire alcaro, é i faire Eruo, caita lenna!
But may no one among you have difficulty because he has done murder or theft or evil or has troubled others concerning their own affairs.	Mal nai úquen mici le samuva urdie pan acáries nahtie hya pilwe hya ulco hya atarastie exeli pa vére nattoltar.
But if he has difficulty since he is a Christian, may he not be shamed, but may he praise God about this name!	Ono qui samis urdie pan náse Hristondur, nai uas nauva naityana, mal nai laituvas Eru pa esse sina!
For the time has come when the judgement will be begun from God's house. If it is begun from us, what will be the end of those who are not obedient to the gospel of God?	An utúlie i lúme yasse i namie nauva yestaina coallo Eruva. Qui nas yestaina vello, mana nauva i tyel ion uar canwacimye Eruo evandilyonen?
«For if the righteous man is saved with difficulty, what will happen to the one hostile to God and to the sinner?»	«Ar qui i faila nér ná rehtaina urdave, mana martuva i Erucotyan ar i úcarindon?»
Thus, may those who have difficulty since they heed God's will, put their souls in his hand while they do good.	Sie, nai i samir urdie pan cimilte Eruo indóme panyuvar fealtar máryasse, íre carilte márie.
Therefore, to the elders among you I give this urging – for I as well am an older man together with you, and a witness to the torments of the Christ, a person who has a share in the glory that will be revealed:	Etta, i amyárain mici le antan hortale sina – an yando inye ná amyára nér aselde, ar astaro i ñwalmion i Hristo, quén ye same ranta i alcaresse ya nauva apantaina:
Be shepherds of the flock of God under your patronage, not by compulsion, but by will, not in order to receive unjust gain, but with a burning spirit,	Na mavari i lámáreo Eruo nu ortírielda, lá maustanen, mal nirmenen, lá camien úfaila ñéte, mal úruva ºúlenen,
not as if you rule the people under your patronage, but by being examples to the flock.	lá ve qui turilde i queni nu ortírielda, mal návenen epemmali i lámáren.
And when the Chief Shepherd shall be revealed, you will receive the glorious crown which is not fading.	Ar íre i Héra Mavar nauva apantaina, camuvalde i alcarinqua ríe ya ua fifírula.
In the same manner, you young ones, subject yourselves to the elders. But carry as your belt, all among you, lowliness of mind, one towards the other, for God stands against the haughty ones, but to people that humble themselves he gives grace.	Mí imya lé, a nessar, á panya inde nu i amyárar. Mal á cole ve quilta, illi mici le, naldie sámo, quén i exenna, an Eru tare i turquimannar, mal quenin i nucumixer antas lisse.
Therefore humble yourselves under God's mighty hand, for him to make you exalted when the time comes.	Etta nucuma inde nu Eruo taura má, carieryan le arte íre i lúme tule.
Throw your every fear at him, for you are important to him.	Hata ilya caurelda senna, an nalde valde sen.
Your enemy, the Devil, walks to and from seeking people that he can devour.	Hepa laicelda, na cuive! Ñottolda, i Arauco, vanta sir yo tar cestala quelli i polis ammate.
But stand against him, firm in the faith, knowing that your brotherhood endures the same difficulties in the whole world.	Mal tara senna, tulce i saviesse, istala i perpere otornasselda i imye urdier i quanda mardesse.
But, when you have had difficulty for a short time, the God of all grace, who called you to his everlasting glory by Christ, will himself renew you. He will make you firm, he will make you strong.	Mal, íre asámielde urdie ter ºinta lúme, i Aino ilya Erulisseva, ye le-yalle oialea alcareryanna Hristonen, immo envinyatuva le. Le-caruvas tulce, le-caruvas polde.
To him be the might forever, amen!	Na sen i melehte tennoio, násie!
Through Silvanus, whom I count as a faithful brother, I have written in few words, urging and witnessing that this is the true grace of God; stand firm in it.	Ter Silváno, ye notin ve voronda háno, etécien mance quettalissen, hortala ar vettala i si ná i nanwa lisse Eruo; tara tulce sasse.
 who is in Babel , chosen with yourselves, greets you, and so does Mark my son.	Ye ea Vavelde, cílina aselde, suila le, ar sie care Marco yondonya.
Greet one another with a kiss of love! May all among you have peace in Christ!	Á suila quén i exe miquenen melmeva! Nai illi mici le samuvar raine Hristosse!
Paul and Silvanus and Timothy to the congregation in Thessalonica, in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: May you have grace and peace!	Paulo ar Silváno ar Timoşeo i ocombenna Şessalonicasse, mi Eru i Atar ar i Heru Yésus Hristo: Nai samuvalde lisse yo raine!
We always give thanks to God when we recall you in our prayers, ever	Antalme illume hantale Erun íre enyalilme le hyamielmassen, oi
recalling your faithful work and your loving toil and your steadfastness in the hope that you have in our Lord, Jesus Christ, before our God and Father.	enyalila voronda molielda ar melila mótielda ar voronwielda mí estel ya samilde mi Herulva, Yésus Hristo, epe Ainolva ar Atarelva.
For we know, brothers loved by God, how you are chosen,	An istalme, hánor méline lo Eru, manen nalde cíline,
and among you the gospel that we brought was not only by words, but it came with power and Holy Spirit and made you fully certain about it, as you know how we behaved among you for your good.	an mici elde i evandilyon ya tallelme úne rie quettainen, mal túles túrenen ar Aire Feanen ar carne le aqua tulce pa sa, ve istalde manen lenganelme mici le márieldan.
For you followed in our path and in the Lord's path, receiving the word in harsh tribulation, having joy by Holy Spirit.	Ar hilyanelde tielmasse ar i Heruo tiesse, camila i quetta mi naraca şangie, arwe alasseo Aire Feanen.
Thus you were made an example for all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia.	Sie anelde cárine epemma illin i savir Maceroniasse ar Acaiasse.
For from you the Lord's word has been made known, not in Macedonia and Achaia alone, but to every place your faith in God has gone out, and so we not not have need of saying a single thing.	An lello i Heruo quetta anaie carna sinwa, lá rie Maceroniasse ar Acaiasse, mal ilya nómenna savielda Erusse eteménie, ar sie ualme same maure quetiéva erya nat.
For they themselves are telling how we first came to you, and how you turned yourselves to God from the idols, to be servants for a living and true God,	An té inte nyárar manen minyave túlelme lenna, ar manen quernelde inde Erunna ho i cordoni, náven núror coirea ar nanwa Ainon,
and to look forward to the coming from heaven of his Son, whom he raised from dead: Jesus, who delivers us from the coming wrath.	ar yétien ompa i tulienna menello Yondoryo, ye ortanes qualinallon: Yésus, ye vi-etelehta i tuluvaila rúşello.
For you know, brothers, how our coming to you was not for nothing.	An elde istar, hánor, manen tulielma lenna úne muntan.
But after suffering violence in Philippi, as you know, we received boldness from God to speak to you God's gospel, although by a difficult fight.	Mal apa perperie orme Filippisse, ve istalde, camnelme verie Erullo quetien lenna Eruo evandilyon, ómu urda mahtiénen.
For the encouragement which we give does not come from errror or from uncleanness or by a lie,	An i hortale ya antalme ua tule loimallo hya úpoiciello hya hurunen,
but as we have been tested by God and found worthy to receive the gospel into our keeping, so we speak, not to please men, but God who tests our heart.	mal tambe anaielme tyastane lo Eru ar hírine valde camien i evandilyon mir hepielma, síve quetilme, lá fastien atani, mal Eru ye tyasta endalma.
For as you know, we have not ever spoken with smooth words, or with a hidden greedy desire; God is witness!	An ve istalde, ualme oi equétie passe quettainen, hya nurtana milca írenen: Eru astarindo ná!
Furthemore, we have not sought glory from men, not from you or from others,	Ente, ualme ecestie alcar atanillon, lá eldello hya exellon,
though it would have been possible for us to be a heavy burden as Christ's apostles.	ómu éciévane men náve lunga cólo ve Hristo aposteli.
On the contrary, we were gentle among you, as when a nursing mother behaves lovingly towards her own children.	Úsie, anelme moice imíca le, ve íre tyetila amil lenga mélave vére hínaryain.
Therefore, since you are dear to us, we thought well about giving you a part, not in God's gospel alone, but also in our own soul, since you have become dear to us.	Etta, pan nalde melde men, sannelme mai pa antave len ranta, lá rie mi Eruo evandilyon, mal yú mi véra fealma, pan olólielde melde men.
For you recall, brothers, our work and our toil. Working night and day, not to be a burden upon anyone among you, we made known to you God's gospel.	An enyalilde, hánor, molielma ar mótielma. Molila lómisse yo auresse, lá náven cólo aiquenna mici le, carnelme sinwa len Eruo evandilyon.
You are witnesses, like God is, how holy and just and perfect we were among you who believe.	Nalde astarmor, ve Eru ná, manen airi ar faile ar ilvane anelme mici elde i savir.
Thus you know well how we encouraged everyone among you, like a father encouraging his children,	Sie istalde mai manen hortanelme ilquen mici le, ve atar hortala hínaryar,
comforting you and witnessing to you, for you to walk worthily for God who calls you into his own kingdom and his glory.	tiutala le ar vettala len, vantieldan valdave Erun ye le-yale mir véra aranierya ar alcarerya.
And therefore we also give God thanks continually, for when you got God's word which you heard from us, you received it not like men's word, but like that which truly it is: as God's word, which also works in you that believe.	Ar tanen yú elme antar Erun hantale voro, an íre ñentelde Eruo quetta ya hlasselde mello, camneldes lá ve atanion quetta, mal ve ta ya nanwave nas: ve Eruo quetta, ya yú mole lesse i savir.
For you have followed, brothers, in the path of the congregations of God which are in Judea in Jesus Christ, for you as well have suffered from people of your own nation the same things that also they suffer from the Jews,	An ihílielde, hánor, i tiesse i ocombion Eruo yar ear Yúreasse mi Hristo Yésus, an yú elde eperpérier quenillon véra nóreldo i imye nati yar yú té perperir i Yúrallon,
that killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets alike, and persecuted us. Furthermore, they fail to please God, but they stand against the good of all men,	i nacanter i Heru Yésus ar i Erutercánor véla, ar roitaner mé. Ente, loitalte fasta Erun, mal tarilte i márienna ilye atanion,
since they stop us from speaking to people of the nations for their salvation, and so they always fill the measure of their sins. But in the end the wrath has come upon them.	pan pustalte me carpiello queninnar i nórion rehtieltan, ar sie illume quatilte úcareltaron lesta. Mal i mettasse i rúşe utúlie téna.
But we, brothers, when you were away from us for a short time – in person, not in heart – we tried with still greater vigour to see your face, by a great desire.	Ono elme, hánor, íre anelde oa mello şinta lúmesse – mi quén, lá mi enda – névelme en ambe túra veassenen cene cendelelda, túra írenen.
For this reason we wanted to come to you – indeed I, Paul – at one time and two alike, but Satan stopped us.	Sina castanen mernelme tule lenna – é inye, Paulo – mi lú er ar atta véla, mal Sátan pustane me.
And what is our hope or our joy or the crown by which we praise ourselves? Is that not you, before our Lord, Jesus, at his return?	An mana estelelma hya alasselma hya i ríe yanen laitalmexer? Ma ta ua elde, epe Herulva, Yésus, mi entulesserya?
For you are our glory and our joy!	An elde nar alcarelma ar alasselma!
Therefore, when it was not possible for us to bear it more, we made the choice of being left in Athens, alone.	Etta, íre ua ence men cole sa ambe, carnelme i cilme náveva hehtana mi Aşen, erinque.
For we sent Timothy, who is our brother and who with us is God's servant in the gospel of Christ, for him to make you firm and to urge you concerning your faith,	Ar mentanelme Timoşeo, ye hánolma ná ar ye aselme Eruo núro ná mi Hristo evandilyon, carieryan le tulce ar hortaven le pa savielda,
to stop anyone from being pulled away by these tribulations. For you know that this thing is destined for us .	pustien aiquen návello túcina oa lo şangier sine. An elde istar i nat sina ná ven martyana.
Indeed also when we were with you we told you beforehand that we were going to suffer tribulation, as has also happened and you know.	É yú íre anelme aselde nyarnelme len nóvo i perperumnelve şangie, ve yú amartie ar istalde.
Indeed for this reason, when for me it was not possible to bear it more, I sent to know your faithfulness. My fear was that perhaps the Tempter has tempted you in this or that manner, and our toil was for nothing.	É sina castanen, íre inyen ua ence cole sa ambe, mentanen istien voronwielda. Caurenya náne i cé i Şahtando le-aşahtie mi sina hya sana lé, ar mótielma náne muntan.
But now Timothy has come to us from you, and he has given us the god news about your faithfulness and your love, and about how you have a good memory of ourselves, always longing to see us, like we long for you.	Mal sí Timoşeo utúlie menna lello, ar ánies men i máre sinyar pa voronwelda ar melmelda, ar pa manen samilde mára enyalie elmeva, illume milyala cene me, ve elme milyar lé.
Therefore, brothers, we have been comforted concerning you by your faithfulness, in all our need and our tribulation.	Etta, hánor, anaielme tiutana pa le voronweldanen, mi ilya maurelma ar şangielma.
For now we are alive, if you stand firm in the Lord.	An sí nalme coirie, qui tarilde tulce i Herusse.
For what thanks is it possible for us to give to God about you, about the whole joy by which we are happy on your behalf before our God,	An mana hantale ece men anta Erun pa elde, pa i quanda alasse yanen nalme valime rá elden epe Ainolva,
when at night and at day, with the greatest vigour, we are making petitions to see your face and to fill which your faith lack?	íre lómisse yo auresse, i antúra veassenen, cáralme arcandeli cenien cendelelda ar quatien yar savielda pene?
Now may our God and our Father himself grant us a straight path to you!	Sí nai Ainolya ar Atarelva inse antauva men téra tie lenna!
Furthermore, may the Lord cause you to grow and have abundant love one for the other and for all, as also we have love for you,	Ente, nai i Heru tyaruva le ale ar same úvea melme quén i exeva ar illiva, ve yú elme samir melme eldeva,
to make your heart firm, without spot in holiness before our God and our Father at the return of our Lord, Jesus, with all his holy ones. Amen!	carien endalda tulca, pen motto airesse epe Ainolva ar Atarelva mí entulesse Herulvo, Yésus, as ilye airiryar. Násie!
Finally, brothers, we ask of you and encourage you by the Lord Jesus: As you received from us the knowledge about how it is necessary for you to behave and to please God, so you indeed behave, but do it more fully.	Teldave, hánor, arcalme lello ar hortar le i Heru Yésunen: Tambe camnelde mello i istya pa manen mauya len lenga ar fasta Eru, síve é lengalde, mal cara sa ambe aqua.
For you know the exhortations that we gave you through the Lord Jesus.	An istalde i hortaler yar antanelme len ter i Heru Yésus.
For so is God's will: That you will be hallowed – that you will keep yourselves away from fornication.	An sie Eruo indóme ná: I nauvalde airinte – i hepuvalde inde oa hrupuhtiello.
Thus it is necessary for everyone among you to possess his own vessel, in sanctification and in glory,	Sie mauya ilquenen mici le harya véra venerya, mi airitáve ar mi alcar,
not in greedy lust, as have also the nations that do not know God.	lá mi milca maile, ve samir yú i nóri yar uar ista Eru.
It is necessary that no one crosses the line and does unjustice to his brother in this matter, for the Lord shall avenge all such things, as we have told you previously and have witnessed to you.	Mauya in úquen lahta i tea ar care úfailie hánoryan mi natto sina, an i Heru ahtaruva ilye taiti nati, ve anyárielme len nóvo ar evettielme len.
For God did not call us to uncleanness, but in sanctification.	An Eru ua vi-yalde úpoicienna, mal airitávesse.
Therefore, who does not give heed does not fail to give heed to man, but to God, who also sets his Holy Spirit in you.	Etta, ye ua cime ua loita cime atan, mal Eru, ye yú panya Aire Fearya lesse.
But concerning brotherly love you do not have need that I will write to you, for you are instructed by God that you are to love one another,	Mal pa hánomelme ualde same maure i tecuvalme lenna, an elde nar peantane lo Eru i meluvalde quén i exe,
and indeed you do so, loving the brothers in all of Macedonia. But we encourage you, brothers, that you will do so more fully,	ar é carilde sie, melila i hánor quanda Maceroniasse. Mal hortalme le, hánor, i caruvalde sie ambe aqua,
and that you will make your goal that you will have a quiet life, heeding your own matters and working with your own hands , as we commanded you.	ar i caruvalde ennelda i samuvalde quilda coivie, cimila vére nattoldar ar molila vére máldanten, ve cannelme len.
Thus you can walk in a proper manner, as seen by people on the outside, and in need of nothing.	Sie polilde vanta mi vanima lé, ve cénaina lo i queni mí ette, ar mi maure muntava.
But brothers, we do not wish that you are to be ignorant about the slumbering ones . Thus would will not have the same grief that the others have, they that do not have hope.	Mal hánor, ualme mere i nauvalde laistie pa i lornar. Sie ualde samuva i imya naire ya i exi samir, té i uar same estel.
For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, God will also bring with him in the same manner that have died through Jesus.	An qui savilve i Yésus qualle ar enoronte, Eru yú taluva óse mí imya lé i aquálier ter Yésus.
For this matter we speak to you by God's word: We, the living ones that remain until the Lord's coming, will by no means come before that have died,	An natto sina quetilve lenna Eruo quettanen: Elve, i coirear i lemyar tenna i Heruo entulesse, laume tuluvar epe i aquálier,
for the Lord himself will come down from heaven with a cry, with the voice of a chief angel and having the trumpet of God, and the dead ones in Christ will rise first.	an i Heru inse tuluva undu menello as yello, as i óma héra valo ar arwa i hyólo Eruo, ar i qualinar Hristosse ortuvar minyave.
Thereafter we, the living ones who remain, will be snatched away with them into the coulds to meet the Lord in the air, and thus we will always be with the Lord.	Epeta elve, i coirear i lemyar, nauvar rapane oa aselte mir i fanyar velien i Heru i vilyasse, ar sie nauvalve illume as i Heru.
Therefore comfort one another with these words.	Etta á tiuta quén i exe sine quettainen.
But concerning the times and moments, brothers, you do not have need that anyone writes to you.	Mal pa i lúmi ar i lúr, hánor, ualde same maure in aiquen tece lenna.
For you know well that the Lord's day will come like a thief in the night.	An elde istar mai in i Héruo ré tuluva ve arpo i lómisse.
When they say: “Peace and security!”, then destruction will with a sudden twist come upon them, just as when the sharp pain seizes a woman heavy with child before she bears her child, and they will by no means escape.	Íre quetilte: “Raine yo varnasse!”, tá nancarie rincenen tuluva téna, aqua ve i aice mapa lapselunga nís nó colis hínarya, ar laume uşuvalte.
But you, brothers, are not in the dark, and so the day will not fall upon you like a thief,	Mal elde, hánor, uar i morniesse, ar sie i ré ua lantuva lenna ve arpo,
for all among you are sons of light and sons of day. We are not of the night or of darkness.	an illi mici le nar yondor calo ar yondor aureo. Ualve i lómio hya morniéno.
Therefore, let us not be asleep like the others, but let us be awake and keep our keenness of perception.	Etta, ávalve na lorne ve i exi, mal alve na coivie ar hepe laicelva.
For the slumbering ones are slumbering at night, and that fill themselves with wine drink wine at night.	An i lornar nar lorne lómisse, ar i quatir inte limpenen sucir limpe lómisse.
But we that are of the day, let us keep our keenness of perception, bearing the breastplate of faith and of love, and as a helmet, the hope of salvation.	Mal elve i nar i aureo, alve hepe laicelva, colila i ambasse saviéva ar melmeva, ar ve cassa, i estel rehtiéva.
For God did not reserve us for anger, but for our receiving salvation through our Lord, Jesus Christ	An Eru ua me-sante rúşen, mal camielvan rehtie ter Herulva, Yésus Hristo
who died for us. Thus, living ones or dead ones, we shall live with him.	ye qualle ven. Sie, coirear hya qualinar, coituvalve óse.
Therefore comfort one another with these words, and build up one another, as indeed you are doing.	Etta á tiuta quén i exe sine quettainen, ar á carasta ama quén i exe, ve é cáralde.
But we ask of you, brothers, give heed to those that toil among you and and lead you and show you the way.	Mal arcalme lello, hánor, cima i mótar mici le ar tulyar le ar tanar len i tie.
Have great awe for them, in love, because of their work. Keep peace among yourselves.	Sama túra áya tien, melmesse, molieltanen. Hepa raine mici inde.
But we urge you, brothers: Show the right path to the errant ones, speak with comfort to that lack courage, help the ones that are weak, have patience towards all.	Mal hortalme le, hánor: Á tana i téra tie i ráneain, queta tiutalénen innar penir huore, á manya i nar milye, sama cóle illin.
See that nobody pays for evil with evil, but always pursue what is good, one for the other, and for all.	Cena i uquen paitya ulcun ulcunen, mal illume á roita ya mára ná, quén i exen, ar illin.
Always have joy.	Illume sama alasse.
Pray ever.	Hyama oiale.
About everything give thanks, for that is God's will in Jesus Christ for you.	Pa ilqua á anta hantale, an ta ná Eruo indóme Yésus Hristosse elden.
Do not extinguish the Spirit.	Áva luhtya i Faire.
Do not look down on speaking like a prophet.	Áva nattire quetie ve Erutercáno.
Test all things; keep that are good.	Á tyasta ilye nati; hepa yar máre nar.
Keep yourselves away from every kind of evil.	Hepa inde oa ilya nostalello ulcuo.
May the God of peace himself sanctify you completely! May your spirit and your soul and your body be kept in a perfect manner at the return of our Lord, Jesus Christ.	Nai i Aino raineva immo airitauva le aqua! Nai fairelda ar fealda ar hroalda nauvar hépaine mi ilvana lé mí entulesse Herulvo, Yésus Hristo.
He who calls you is faithful – who will also do it.	Isse ye le-yale voronda ná – ye yú caruvas sa.
Brothers, pray also for us!	Hánor, hyama yú elmen!
Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss!	Á suila ilye i hánor aire miquenen!
I command you by oath, in the Lord: Read out this letter to all the brothers.	Canin len vandanen, mí Heru: Á et-henta tecetta sina ilye i hánoin.
May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.	Nai Yésus Hristo Herulvo lisse euva aselde.
Paul – apostle of Jesus Christ, as commanded by God our Father and Christ Jesus our hope,	Paulo – Yesus Hristo apostel, ve cánina lo Eru Rehtolva ar Hristo Yésus estelelva,
to Timotheus, true child in the faith: May be grace, mercy, peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.	Timoşeonna, nanwa hína i saviesse: Nai euvar lisse, oravie, raine ho Eru i Atar ar Hristo Yésus Herulva.
As I exhorted you to remain in Ephesus when I was to go to Macedonia, so I do now, for you to command some people that they are not to teach strange teaching	Ve hortanenye lye lemya Efesusse íre lelyumnen Maceronianna, sie carin sí, canielyan quenelin i ávalte peanta ettelea peantie
and that they are not to heed fables and genealogies without end, which lead to inquiries before they lead to a distribution of anything by God in the faith.	ar i ávalte cime nyarier ar ontaleparmar ú metto, yar tulyar minaşúriennar nó tulyalte i etsatienna aiquava lo Eru i saviesse.
The aim of this charge is love out of a pure heart and out of a good conscience without hypocrisy.	Canie sino met ná melme et poica endallo ar et mára immotuntiello ar saviello ú imnetyaleo.
But turning themselves from these things some have been turned to empty speaking ,	Mal quérala inte sine natillon quelli anaier quérine cumna quetienna,
wishing to be teachers of law, but failing to understand both the things of which they are speaking and the ones of which they talk with bold words.	mérala náve peantari şanyeo, mal loitalte hanya yúyo i nati pa yar quétalte ar tai pa yar carpalte verye quettalínen.
We know that the Law is good, if one uses it in a regular manner,	Istalve in i Şanye mára ná, qui mo yuhta sa mi şanya lé,
having this knowledge: It does not stand against a righteous person, but against people lawless and rebellious, godless and sinners, without love and unholy, that kill fathers and mothers, manslayers,	arwa istya sino: Uas tare faila quenenna, mal queninnar şanyelóre ar amortala, ainolóre ar úcarindor, ú melmeo ar úairi, i nahtar atari ar amilli, atannahtari,

according to the glorious gospel of the happy God, which was placed in my keeping.	ve i alcarinqua evandilyon i valima Aino, ya náne panyaina hepienyasse.
I thank Christ Jesus, who gave me strength , since he counted me faithful and reserved me for servant-work,	Hantan Hristo Yésun, ye antane nin antoryame, pan nontesen voronwa ar ni-sante núromolien,
though formerly I was a person who blasphemed and persecuted and was violent. And yet I received mercy, since in ignorance I did so, lacking faith.	ómu yá anen quén ye naiquente ar roitane ar náne naraca. Ananta camnen oravie, pan laistasse carnen sie, pénala savie.
But our Lord's grace was extremely abundant, with faith and love in Christ Jesus.	Mal Herulvo lisse náne ita úvea, as savie ar melme mi Hristo Yésus.
This saying is faithful, and worthy of being fully received: Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners. Among them I am the most prominent.	Quetie sina vórima ná, ar valda náveo aqua cámina: Hristo Yésus túle mir i mar rehtien úcarindor. Mici té inye i amminda ná.
But the reason by which I received mercy was that by me it was possible for Christ Jesus to show his patience first, making me an example of who will believe in him, thus getting eternal life.	Mal i casta yanen camnen oravie náne i inyenen ence Hristo Yésun tana quanda cólerya minyave, cárala ní epemma ion savuvar sesse, sie ñetala oira coivie.
To the king of eternity, incorruptable, invisible, to the sole God, be honor and glory forever and ever! Amen.	Aranen oialeo, alahastima, alacénima, i erya Ainon, na laitie ar alcar tennoio ar oi! Násie.
This overseership I put on you, Timothy my child, by the predictions which led to you; thus you can by them fight in the good fight,	Ortírie sina panyan lyesse, Timoşeo hínanya, i apaceninen yar tulyaner lyenna; sie polil tainen mahta i mára mahtiesse,
having faith and a good conscience, which some have thrown away, and the ship of their faith has been destroyed.	arwa saviéno ar mára immotuntieno, ya queneli ahátier oa, ar savielto cirya anaie nancarna.
Among them are Hymenaeus and Alexander, and I have given them into Satan's power, for them to learn by chastisement that they are not to blaspheme.	Mici té nar Himenaio ar Alexander, ar ánien tu mir Sátano túre, pariettan paimestanen i ávatte naiquete.
Therefore, firstly, I exhort that you make petitions, prayers, intercessions , thanksgivings, concerning all men,	Etta, minyave, hortan i carilde arcandi, hyamier, mánacestier, hantaler, pa ilye atani,
concerning kings and all that are in prominent places, for them to have a life which is quiet and in peace, in all reverence and seriousness.	pa arani ar illi i ear mi minde meni, samielvan coivie ya ná quilda ar rainesse, mi ilya ainocimie ar sanwelungie.
That is good and acceptable to God our Savior,	Ta ná mára ar maicámima Eru Rehtolvan,
who wishes that all men will be saved and will come to knowledge of the truth.	ye mere i ilye atani nauvar rehtaine ar tuluvar istyanna i nanwiéno.
For there is one God, and one intermediary between God and men, Christ Jesus the man,	An ea Eru er, ar er enelmo imbi Eru ar atani, Hristo Yésus i atan,
who gave himself as a ransom for all: Of that it is necessary to witness in the times that we have.	ye antanexe ve nanwere illin: Pa ta mauya vetta mi lúmi yar samilve.
For that purpose I was appointed a preacher and an apostle – I tell the truth, I do not lie – teacher of nations, in faith and truth.	Tana mehten anen sátina nyardar ar apostel – nyarin i nanwie, uan húra – peantar nórion, mi savie ar nanwie.
Therefore I wish that in every place men will pray, raising faithful hands, turning themselves from wrath and quarrelings.	Etta merin i mi ilya nóme atani hyamuvar, ortala sarte mát, quérala inte rúşello ar costiellon.
In the same manner I wish that the women will adorn themselves with well-arranged garments, in a humble manner and having soundness of mind, not arranging their hair, or with gold or with pearls or with costly garment,	Mi imya lé merin i netyuvar i nissi inte maipartaine larmainen, mi nucumna lé ar arwe máleo sámo, lá partala findilelta, hya maltanen hya marillainen hya mirwa larmanen,
but in the manner worthy of women that say about themselves that they are reverential, that is, by good deeds.	mal mi lé valda nission i quetir pa inte i nalte ainocimye – ta ná, máre cardainen.
A woman is to learn in quiet, fully submitting herself to authority.	Nís paruva quildesse, aqua panyala inse nu hére.
I do not allow that a woman teaches, or has authority over a man; a woman will be silent.	Uan lave i nís peanta, hya same hére or nér; nís nauva quilda.
For Adam was created first, then Eve.	An Atan náne ontaina minyave, tá Éve.
Furthermore, Adam was not seduced, but the woman was seduced and fell into law-breaking.	Ente, Atan úne úşahtaina, mal i nís náne úşahtaina ar lantane mir şanyeracie.
But she will be saved by bearing children, if they remain in faith and love and sanctification, with soundness of mind.	Mal nauvas rehtaina coliénen híni, qui lemyalte mi savie ar melme ar airitie, as mále sámo.
Faithful the word: If anyone desires an office of overseer, he desires a good work.	Vórima i quetta: Qui aiquen mere ortírie, meris mára molie.
Therefore it is necessary that an overseer will be beyond suspicion, husband of a single wife, lowly in his habits, having soundness of mind, arranged , friendly to strangers, knowing instruct,	Etta mauya i nauva ortirindo napsa pella, erya verio veru, nalda haimassen, arwa máleo sámo, partaina, nilda etteleain, istala peanta,
not given to wine, not beating, but gentle, not a money-lover,	lá antaina limpen, lá palpala, mal moica, lá tyelpendil,
a man leading his own family, having reverent childer with every seriousness	nér tulyala véra nosserya, arwa canwacimye hínion ilya sanwelungiesse
(if a person does not know lead his own family, how will he oversee God's congregation?),	(qui quén ua ista tulya véra nosserya, manen ortiruvas Eruo ocombe?),
not a person newly-turned , or maybe he will become proud and will fall under the same judgement as the Devil.	lá quén vinquerna, hya cé nauvas valatea ar lantuva mir i imya námie ve i Arauco.
Therefore, it is necessary that he has a good witness from people on the outside, to stop him from falling into rebuke and the Devil's snare.	Ente, mauya i samis mára vettie quenillon i ettesse, pustien se lantiello mir tulcarpie ar i Arauco remma.
In the same manner it is necessary that congregation-servants will be serious, not speaking with two tongues, not giving themselves to much wine, not greedily seeking unjust gain,	Mi imya lé, mauya i nauva ocombenduri sanwelunge, lá quetila lamba attanen, lá antala inte olya limpen, lá milcave cestala úfaila ñetie,
having the mystery of the faith with a pure conscience.	arwe i fóleo i saviéno poica immotuntiénen.
May they be tested first; thereafter let them be servants, being beyond suspicion.	Nai té nauvar tyastaine minyave; epeta lava tien náve núror, nála napsa pella.
May women in the same manner be serious, not speaking evil about others, lowly in habits, faithful in all things.	Nai nissi mi imya lé nauvar sanwelunge, lá quétala ulco pa exeli, nalda haimassen, voronwe ilye natissen.
May congregation-servants be husbands of a single wife, leading their own families well.	Nai ocombenduri nauvar veruvi erya nisso, tulyala vére nosseltar mai.
For men that serve well as congregation-servants receive a good standing and great freedom of speech as concerns Christ Jesus.	An neri i molir mai ve ocombenduri ñetir mára tarie ar túra lérie quetiéva pa Hristo Yésus.
I write to you these things, though I have hope that I will come to you soon.	Tecin lyen nati sine, ómu samin estel i tuluvan lyenna rato.
But if I am hindered, you will know how it is necessary for you to behave in God's house, which is the congregation of the living God, pillar and support of the truth.	Mal qui nauvan hampa, istuval manen mauya lyen lenga Eruo coasse, ya ná i coirea Eruo ocombe, i nanwiéno tarma ar tulco.
Indeed the secret of reverence is great: He was revealed in the flesh, pronounced righteous in the spirit, showed himself to angels, was preached in the nations, believed in the world, received up in glory.	É i fóle ainocimiéva ná hoa: Anes apantaina i hrávesse, quétina faila i fairesse, tannexe valalin, náne nyardaina i nóressen, sávina i mardesse, cámina ama alcaresse.
But the spirit says in straight words that in last times some will fall away from the faith, heeding spirits that cause others to stray, and the teachings of demons,	Mal i Faire quete tére quettalínen i mí métime lúmi queneli lantuvar oa i saviello, címala faireli i tyarir exi ranya, ar i peantier raucoron,
by the hypocrisy of people that speak lies, having a mark on their own conscience as if made by a hot iron.	i imnatyalénen quenion i quetir huruvi, arwe tehto véra immotuntieltasse ve qui carna lauca anganen.
They forbid that one marries and command that one turns away edibles that God created to be received with thanks by that have faith and knowledge of the truth.	Váquetilte i mo verya ar canir i mo quere oa mastimar yar Eru ontane náven cámine hantalénen lo i samir savie ar istya i nanwiéno.
For every creature of God is good, and there is no need to turn away anything if it is received with thanksgiving,	An ilya onna Eruo mára ná, ar ua ea maure quere oa aiqua qui nas cámina hantalénen,
for it is hallowed by God's word and by prayer.	an nás airinta Eruo quettanen ar hyamiénen.
Giving these orders to the brothers you will be Christ Jesus's good servant, who thrives on the words of faith and of the good teaching which you have followed.	Antala canwar sine i hánoin nauval Hristo Yésuo mára núro, ye ale i quettainen i saviéno ar i mára peantiéno ya ihíliel.
But turn away the unholy fables of old women. But seek to be skilled in reverence!	Mal quera oa i úairi nyarier yáre nission. Ono á cesta náve finwa ainocimiesse!
For making the body skilled is beneficial for a few things, but reverence is beneficial for all things, since it has a promise for this life for and the coming life alike.	An carie i hroa finwa ná aşea nótime natalin, mal ainocimie ná aşea ilye natin, pan samis vanda coivie sinan ar i túlala coivien véla.
Faithful and worthy of being fully received is that saying!	Vórima ar valda náveo aqua cámina tana quetie ná!
For for this purpose we labour and toil, since we have put our hope in a living God, who is a Savior of all men, of the faithful ones above all.	An met sinan molilve ar mótalve, pan apánielve estelelva coirea Ainosse, ye ná Rehto ilye atanion, i vorondaron or illi.
Command them so, and teach!	Cana tien sie, ar á peanta!
Do not let anyone despise your youth. On the contrary, be an example for the faithful ones in speech, in behavior, in love, in faith, in purity.	Áva lave aiquenen nattire néşelya. Úsie, na epemma i vorondain quetiesse, lengiesse, melmesse, saviesse, poiciesse.
Until I shall come, give heed to the reading, the comfort, the teaching.	Tenna tuluvan, cima i hentie, i tiutie, i peantie.
Do not fail to use the grace that is in you, given you by a prediction and by the elder's putting their hands on you.	Áva loita yuhta i lisse ya ea lyesse, antaina lyen apacennen ar i amyáraron paniénen máltat lyesse.
Think about these things, fill your mind with them; thus all will see how you go forward.	Á sana pa nati sine, quata sámalya tainen; sie nauva aşcene illin manen lelyal ompa.
Keep your mind on yourself and on your teaching! Remain in these things, for so doing you save yourself and that listen to you alike.	Hepa sámalya imlesse ar peantielyasse! Á lemya sine natissen, an sie cárala rehtal imle ar i lastar lyenna véla.
Do not speak to an elderly man with harsh words. On the contrary, make an entreaty to him as to a father, to young men as to brothers, to old women as to mothers, to young women as to sisters, in all purity .	Amyáranna áva quete narace quettainen. Úsie, cara arcande sen ve ataren, nesse nerin ve hánoin, yáre nissin ve amillin, nesse nissin ve néşain, ilya poiciesse.
Honor widows that truly are widows.	Á anta alcar verulórain i nanwave nar verulórar.
But if there is a widow with whom there are children or children's children, let them first learn to behave with godly reverence in their own house and give a proper recompensation to their parents , for that is good in God's eyes.	Mal qui ea verulóra as ye ear hínali hya hínali hínaron, lava tien minyave pare lenga ainocimiénen véra coaltasse ar anta vanima nampaityale nostarultant, an ta ná mára Eruo hendusse.
But who indeed is a widow and has become destitute, has put her hope in God and remains in petitions and prayers at night and at day.	Ono ye é verulóra ná ar olólie úna, apánie estelya Erusse ar lemya arcandessen ar hyamiessen lómisse yo auresse.
But she who seeks her lusts is dead, though she lives.	Mal ye cesta maileryar ná qualina, ómu coitas.
Therefore give these orders, to stop anyone from speaking evil about them.	Etta á anta canwar sine, pustien aiquen quetiello ulco pa te.
But if anyone does not give to his own – and above all to those that are in his house – their needs, he has denied the faith and is worse than a person who does not believe.	Mal qui aiquen ua anta véraryain – ar or illi tien i nar coaryasse – maureltar, alálies i savie ar ná faica lá quén ye ua save.
Put a widowed woman on the list if she has years not under sixty , wife of a single husband,	Á panya verulóra nís i témasse qui samis loar lá nu enequean, veri erya veruo,
a woman of whom one tells about her good deeds, if she raised children, if she received foreigners, if she washed the feet of the holy ones, if she helped persecuted ones, if she followed every good deed.	nís pa ye mo nyare pa máre cardaryar, qui ortanes híni, qui camnes ettelear, qui sóves i airion talu, qui manyanes roitainar, qui hilyanes ilya mára carda.
But turn away younger widows, for when their sexual desire draws them away from Christ, they wish to marry	Mal quera oa ambe nesse verúlórar, an íre yérelta tuce te oa Hristollo, merilte verya
and fall under judgement since they abandoned their first steadfastness.	ar lantar nu námie pan hehtanelte minya voronwielta.
At the same time they also learn to be without labor, wandering from house to house, not only failing to labor, but also gossiping and inserting themselves into the affairs of others, talking about things of which there is no need to talk.	Mí imya lú yando parilte náve ú moliéno, vantala coallo coanna, lá eryave loitala mole, mal yando nyátala ar mittala inte mir exelion nattor, carpala pa nati pa yar ua ea maure carpa.
Therefore I wish that these younger widows are to marry, and that they bear children and manage a home; thus who stands against us will not have a reason for speaking mockery.	Etta merin i sine ambe nesse verulórar veryuvar, ar i colilte híni ar mahtar mar; sie ye tare venna ua samuva casta quetien yaiwe.
Even now some are turned to follow Satan.	Yando sí queneli anaier quérine hilien Sátan.
If there are some widows with a believing woman, it compels for her to help them, not putting a burden on the congregation. Then the congregation can help those that indeed are widows.	Qui ea verulórali as sávala nís, mauya sen manya te, lá panyala cólo i ocombenna. Tá i ocombe pole manya i é nar verulórar.
Let the elders that stand before the congregation in a good manner, be counted worthy of double honor, above all the ones that toil in speaking and teaching.	Lava i amyárain i tarir epe i ocombe mi mára lé náve nótaine valde atwa laitiéno, or illi i mótar carpiesse ar peantiesse.
"For the scripture says: ""Do not stop a bull trampling out grain, from eating"", also: ""He who works is worthy of his reward."""	"An i tehtele quete: Áva pusta mundo etevattala ori, matiello,"" yando: ""Ye mole ná valda paityaleryo."""
Do not count an accusation against an elder as true, if there are not two or three witnesses.	Áva note ulquetie amyáranna ve nanwa, qui uat ea astarindor atta hya nelde.
Rebuke sinners while all are watching, to cause also the others to fear.	Á naitya úcarindor íre illi tírar, tyarien yando i exi ruce.
I witness before God and Jesus Christ and the chosen angels: Stick to these things without judging beforehand, doing nothing heeding faces .	Vettan epe Eru ar Hristo Yésus ar i cíline vali: Á himya nati sine ú namiéno nóvo, cárala munta címala cendeler.
Do not put your hands on anyone too soon; furthermore, do not have a share in the sins of others; keep yourself pure.	Áva panya mályat aiquende acca rongo; ente, áva same ranta i úcarissen exion; hepa imle poica.
Do not drink water more, but use a small amount of wine, for your belly and for the illnesses that you frequently suffer.	Áva ambe suce nén, mal á yuhta pitya lesta limpeva, cumbalyan ar i hlívin yar rimbave perperil.
Some men's sins are easy to see, and go before them to judgement. The sins of some other ones also follow.	Atallion úcari nar aşceni, ar menir epe te námienna. Exelion úcari yando hilyar.
In the same manner the good deeds are easily seen, and that are not so, are still impossible to hide.	Mí imya lé yando i máre cardar nar aşceni, ar yar uar sie, nar en úfantime.
Concerning all that are servants under a yoke: Let them count their lords worthy of every honor, to stop anyone from speaking mockery about God's name and the teaching.	Pa illi i nar móli nu yanta: Á notir herultar valde ilya laitiéno, pustien aiquen quetiello yaiwe pa Eruo esse ar i peantie.
Furthermore, may those that have believing husbands not despise them since they are brothers. On the contrary, it is necessary for them to be better servants, since the ones that are helped by their good labor are people that believe and are beloved.Teach these things and so urge!	Ente, nai i samir sávala heruvi uar nattiruva te pan nalte hánor. Úsie, mauya tien náve arye núror, pan i nar manyaine mára molieltanen nar queni i savir ar nar melde.Á peanta nati sine ar á horta sie!
If anyone teaches another teaching and does not receive the healthful words of Jesus Christ our lord or the reverent teaching,	Qui aiquen peanta hyana peantie ar ua came i málie quettar Yésus Hristo Herulvo hya i ainocimya peantie,
he has a swollen mind, understanding nothing, but being sick about questions and quarrels about words. From these things come envies, disputes, mockeries, wicked suspicions,	samis palúna sáma, hanyala munta, mal nála hlaiwa pa maquetier ar costier pa quettar. Sine natillon tulir hruceni, costi, yaiwi, olce napsar,
continual fights among men corrupted in their minds, from whom the truth has been stolen, since they think about reverence as a path to gain.	vórie mahtier mici neri hastaine sámaltassen, illon i nanwie anaie &pílina, pan sanalte pa ainocimie ve tie ñetienna.
Reverence is indeed a path to great gain, together with sufficiency .	Ainocimie é ná tie hoa ñetienna, as fáre.
For we have brought nothing into the world; in the same manner we can carry nothing out of it.	An atálielve munta mir i mar; mi imya lé polilve cole munta et sallo.
Therefore, if we have food and clothes, let them suffice for us.	Etta, qui samilve matta ar larmar, lava tain farya ven.
But those who want to be rich fall into temptation and a snare and many insensible and hurtful desires, which pull men down into undoing and downfall.	Mal i merir náve láre lantar mir úşahtie ar remma ar rimbe úhande ar harnala íreli, yar tucir atani undu mir nancarie ar atalantie.
For the love of money is a root of all evil things, and seeking this love some have been caused to stray from the faith and have pierced themselves with many pains.	An i melme telpeva ná şundo ilye ulce nation, ar cestala melme sina queneli anaier tyárine ranya i saviello ar etérier inte rimbe naicelínen.
But you, man of God, flee from these things! But pursue righteousness, reverence, love, steadfastness, gentleness!	Mal elye, Eruo atan, uşa ho nati sine! Mal á roita failie, ainocimie, savie, melme, voronwie, moicie!
Fight the good fight of faith, seize the eternal life to which you were called and of which you made a good confession before many witnesses.	Á mahta i mára mahtie i saviéno, á mapa i oira coivie yanna anel yálina ar pa ya carnelye mára etequenta epe rimbe astarmoli.
Before God, who gives life to all, and before Jesus Christ, who witnessed to Pontius Pilate the good testimony, I command you:	Epe Eru, ye anta coivie illin, ar epe Yésus Hristo, ye vettane Pontio Piláton i mára vettie, canin len:
Keep you the commandment in a perfect manner of which nobody can speak evil, until the revelation of Jesus Christ our Lord.	Alde himya i axan mi ilvana lé pa ya úquen pole quete ulco, tenna i apantie Yésus Hristo Herulvava.
This relevation the happy and sole Majesty will show in his proper time, the King of who rule as kings and the Lord of who rule as lords,	Apantie sina i valima ar erya Meletya tanuva véra lúmeryasse, i Aran ion turir ve arani ar i Heru ion turir ve heruvi,
the sole Person having immortal life, who dwells in a light that no one can come to, whom no one aming men has seen or can see. To him be the honor and power forever! Amen.	i erya Quén arwa ilfirin coiviéno, ye mare calasse yanna úquen pole tule, ye úquen mici atani ecénie hya pole cene. Sen na i laitie ar túre tennoio! Násie.
Command who are rich in this age: Do not be haughty and do not put hope in riches, which are not steadfast, but in God, who gives us a rich measure of all things for our joy,	Cana in nar láre randa sinasse: Áva na turquime ar áva panya estel mi lar, ya ua tanca, mal mi Eru, ye anta ven lára lesta ilye nativa alasselvan.
Let them labour for good, for them to be rich in good deeds, happy in giving, ready to distribute what they have,	Á molir márien, náveltan láre máre cardassen, valime antiesse, manwe satien ya samilte,
gathering for themselves a good foundation for the time that shall come, in order to seize the real life.	comyala inten mára talma i lúmen ya tuluva, mapien i anwa coivie.
"O Timothy, watch which has been given into your custody, and turn yourself away from the unholy and empty chattings, and from the contrary sayings of the ""knowledge"" called so falsely ."	"A Timoşeo, tira ya anaie antaina mir mandolya, ar quera imle oa i úairi ar cumne nyatiellon, ar i cotye quetiellon i ""istyo"" estaina sie hurunen."
"For saying that they have such ""knowledge"", some have turned themselves away from the faith.May the grace of God be with you!"	"An quétala i samilte taite ""istya"", queneli equérier inte oa i saviello.Nai i Erulisse euva aselde!"
Paul, apostle of Jesus Christ through God's will, and Timothy our brother, to God's congregation which is in Corith, with all the holy ones that are in all of Achaia:	Paulo, Yésus Hristo apostel ter Eruo indóme, ar Timoşeo hánolma, Eruo ocombenna ya ea Corintesse, as ilye i airi i ear mí quanda Acaia:
Grace to you, and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.	Lisse len, ar raine ho Eru Atarelva ar ho i Heru Yésus Hristo.
May God and the Father of Jesus Christ our Lord be blessed, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort,	Nai Eru ar Yésus Hristo Herulvo Atar nauva aistana, i Atar oraviéron ar Aino ilya tiutaleo,
who comforts us in our tribulation. Therefore it is possible for us to comfort the people that suffer every kind of tribulation, with the comfort with which we are comforted by God.	ye vi-tiuta şangielvasse. Etta ece ven tiuta i queni i perperir ilya nostale şangiéno, i tiutalénen yanen elve nar tiutaine lo Eru.
For as the Christ's sufferings are abundant in us, so the comfort that we receive is also abundant by the Christ.	An ve i Hristo perperier nar úvie vesse, sie i tiutale ya camilve ná yando úvea i Hristonen.
If we have tribulation, that is for our comfort and for our salvation; or if we are comforted, that is for our comfort that is working to cause you to be steadfast in the same sufferings which we as well suffer.	Qui samilve şangie, ta ná tiutaleldan ar rehtieldan; hya qui nalve tiutaine, ta ná tiutaleldan ya móla tyarien le náve voronde i imye perperiessen yar yando elme perperir.
For thus our hope for you is firm, since we know that as you have a part in the tribulations, so you will also have a part in the comfort.	Ar sie estelelma len ná tanca, pan istalme i síve samilde ranta i şangiessen, tambe samuvalde yando ranta i tiutalesse.
For we do not wish that you lack knowledge, brothers, about the tribulation that happened to us in Asia – that we were broken by a burden beyond our strength, until we thought that there was no way of saving our life.	An ualve mere i penilde istya, hánor, pa i şangie ya martane men Asiasse – i anelme rácine cólanen han poldorelma, tenna sannelme i ua enge lé rehtiéva coivielma.
Indeed we felt in our heart that we were under a judgement of death, but that happened to cause us to seek our safety, not in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead.	É fellelme endalmasse i anelme nu námie qualmeva, mal ta martane tyarien me cesta varnasselma, lá immesse, mal Erusse ye orta i qualini.
From death-peril that great he delivered us and will he deliver us. In him we have placed our hope that he will deliver us again.	Ho qualmeraxe ta túra etelehtanes me ar etelehtuvas me. Sesse apánielme estelelma i etelehtuvas me ata.
You as well can help with your petition for us, and so numerous ones will give thanks on our behalf, for the grace given us as answer to many prayers.	Yando elde polir manya arcandeldanen men, ar sie rimbali antuvar hantale rámen, i Eruannan antaina men ve hanquenta rimbe hyamiélin.
For concerning this we praise ourselves: Our conscience witnesses that in a holy manner and sincerely to God, not with wisdom of flesh but by grace, we have behaved in the world – above everything to you.	An pa si laitalmexer: Immotuntielma vetta i mi aire lé ar holmo Erun, lá sailiénen hráveva mal Erulissenen, elengielme i mardesse – or ilqua elden.
For we write to you nothing except the things that you can read and understand. I have the hope that you will fully understand them until the end,	An tecilme lenna munta hequa i nati yar polilde henta ar hanya. Samin i estel i aqua hanyuvaldet tenna i metta,
as you have understoood in part, allowing you to praise yourselves concerning us, as we can do concerning you, on the day of the Lord Jesus.	ve ahánielde mi ranta, lávala len laita inde pa elme, ve ece elmen care pa elde, i Heru Yésuo auresse.
Being certain of this I wished beforehand to come to you, to give you a second reason for joy.	Nála tanca pa si mernen nóvo tule lenna, antien len attea casta alassen.
After pausing with you I wished to go to Macedonia, and returning from Macedonia, to be helped by you at the start of my journey to Judea.	Apa hautie aselde mernen lelya Maceronianna, ar nanwénala Maceroniallo, náve manyaina lo elde i yestasse lendanyo Yúreanna.
Wishing that, surely I was not too free? Or the things that I make my goal, did I wish to do them in the manner of the flesh, and so was with me 'Yes, Yes' and 'No, no'?	Mérala ta, lau anen acca léra? Hya i nati yar carin mehtinya, ma mernen caritat mi lé i hráveo, ar sie enger asinye 'Ná, Ná' ar 'Ui, ui'?
But as God is trusty, our speech to you is not Yes and yet No.	Mal ve Eru ná sarta, questalma lenna ua Ná ananta Ui.
For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was made known among you through us – that is, through me and Silvanus and Timothy – was not made Yes and yet No, but Yes has remained in him.	An i Eruion, Yésus Hristo, ye náne carna sinwa mici le ter elme – ta ná, ter inye ar Silváno ar Timoşeo – úne carna Ná ananta Ui, mal Ná teramárie sesse.
For not heeding how many God's promises are, in him they have their Yes. Therefore also through him the Amen is spoken to God by us, for his glory.	An lá címala manen rimbe Eruo vandar nar, sesse samilte Nálta. Etta yando ter sé i Násie ná quétina Erunna lo elve, alcareryan.
But who has made you and us firm for the Christ, and who has annointed us, is God –	Mal ye acárie lé ar mé tance i Hriston, ar ye ilívie vi, ná Eru –
he who also has put his seal on us and has given us security of the spirit in our heart.	sé ye yando apánie lihtarya vesse ar ánie ven varnasse i faireo endalvasse.
But I call God as witness against my own life: to save you from grief that I did not come to Corinth.	Ono inye yale Eru ve astarmo véra cuilenyanna: Rehtien le nyérello uan utúlie Corintenna.
Not that we are lords of your faith, but we work with you for your joy, for by the faith you stand.	Lá i nalme heruvi savieldo, mal molilme aselde alassedan, an i saviénen tarilde.
Fot this thing is my choice: that I will not come to you again in grief.	An nat sina ná cilmenya: i uan tuluva lenna ata nyéresse.
For if I cause grief to you, who will give me joy expect the person to whom I have caused grief?	An qui tyarin nyére len, man antuva nin alasse hequa i quén yen inye atyárie nyére?
And therefore I wrote as I did, that when I came I was not going to have grief from the people for whom compelled to bring me joy. For I was sure about you all, that in my joy all among you were going to have a part.	Ar etta tencen ve carnen, i íre túlen uan samumne nyére i quenillon in mauyane tala nin alasse. An anen tanca pa elde illi, i alassenyasse illi mici le samumner ranta.
And out of great tribulation, being afflicted in my heard and having many tears, I wrote to you – not to cause you grief, but to allow you to know the abundant love that I have for you.	An et hoa şangiello, moiala endanyasse ar arwa rimbe nírion, tencen lenna – lá tyarien len nyére, mal lavien len ista i úvea melme ya samin len.
For if anyone has caused grief, he has not caused it to me, but in a measure – not to speak in too harsh a manner – to all among you.	Mal qui aiquen atyárie nyére, uas atyárie sa inyen, mal mi lesta – lá carpien mi acca naraca lé – illin mici le.
When he has so been shamed by the majority , that is enough for such a man.	Íre sie anaies naityana lo i amarimbar, ta farya taite neren.
Therefore turn yourselves and instead forgive him and confort him, or such a man will perhaps be consumed by too deep a grief.	Etta quera inde ar i mende ásen apsene ar áse tiuta, hya taite nér cé nauva ammátina acca tumna nyérenen.
Thus I urge you that you will show your love of him.	Sie hortan le i tanuvalde melmelda séva.
For for that purpose I write also to test you, to know if you heed the commands in all things.	An tana mehten tecin yando tyastien le, istien qui cimilde i canwar ilye natissen.
Everything that you forgive, I also forgive. Everything that I have forgiven – if I have forgiven anything – has been for your good before Christ,	Ilqua ya apsenilde, yando inye apsene. Ilqua ya inye apesénie – qui apesénien aiqua – anaie márieldan epe Hristo,
to stop Satan from reaching over you; for we do not lack knowledge about his plans.	pustien Sátan rahtiello or vi; an ualve pene istya pa panoryar.
Now when I came to Troas to make the gospel known, and a door was opened for me in the Lord,	Sí íre túlen Troasenna carien i evandilyon sinwa, ar fenna náne nin latyaina i Herusse,
I did not have rest in my spirit since I did not find Titus my brother; but I said farewell to them and went away to Macedonia.	uan sáme sére fairenyasse pan uan hirne Títo hánonya; mal quenten namárie téna ar oante Maceronianna.
But thanks be to God, who always leads us in victory with the Christ, and through us he spreads in every place the scent of the knowledge about him!	Mal hantale na Erun, ye illume tulyar me apairesse as i Hristo, ar ter elme vintas mi ilya nóme i ne i istyo pa sé!
For to God we are Christ's sweet scent, among that will be saved and that will be destroyed	An Erun nalme Hristo lisse ne, imíca i nauvar rehtaine ar i nauvar nancarne
– to the last ones , a scent of death which brings death, but to the first ones , a scent of life that brings life. And who is sufficient for these things?	– i teldain, qualmeo ne ya tala qualme, mal i minyain, coiviéno ne ya tala coivie. Ar man farya sine natin?
For we do not make trade with God's word, as numerous ones do, but we speak sincerely, as sent by God and watched by God, in Christ.	An ualme care mancale Eruo quettanen, ve rimbali carir, mal quetilme holmo, ve mentaine lo Eru ar tírine lo Eru, i Hristosse.
Do we again give a good witness to ourselves? Or perhaps we have need of good witness to you, or for us to receive it from you?	Ma ata antalme mára vettie immen? Hya cé samilme maure mára vettiéva len, hya camielman sa lello?
Our letter is you, written in our heart and known and read by all men.	Mentalma elde ná, técina eldalmasse ar sinwa ar cendaina lo ilye atani.
For is easily seen that you are a letter from Christ, a fruit of our ministry, written not with ink but by the spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone, but on tablets of flesh – on hearts.	An ná aşcénima i nalde menta Hristollo, yáve núromolielmo, técina lá moronen mal i coirea Eruo fairenen, lá palmassen ondova, mal palmassen hráveva – endassen.
And this is the firm faith that we have in God through the Christ.	Ar si ná i tanca savie ya samilme Erusse ter i Hristo.
Not that we, in ourselves, are sufficient to count anything as if it came from ourselves, but our sufficiency comes from God.	Lá i elme, mi imme, faryar notien aiqua ve qui túles immello, mal fárelma tule Erullo.
He made us sufficient servants of a new covenant, not of a written law, but of the spririt; for the written law kills, but the spirit gives life.	Sé carne me fárie núror vinya véreo, lá técina şanyeo, mal i faireo; an i técina şanye nahta, mal i faire anta coivie.
But if the ministry of death by the written law was established in a glory so great that it was impossible for the Children of Israel to look at the face of Moses, because of the glory that was in his face – a glory that was going to fade –	Mal qui i núromolie qualmeva i técina şanyenen náne tulcaina mi alcar ta túra i náne úcárima i Israelindin yéta Móseo cendele, i alcarnen ya enge cendeleryasse – alcar ya firumne –
will not the ministry of the spirit be glorious far beyond that?	ma ua i núromolie i faireva nauva alcarinqua ambela ta?
For if the ministry by which people were judged evil was glorious, the ministry that makes people righteous has a glory much more abundant.	An qui i núrumolie yanen queni náner námine ulce náne alcarinqua, i núromolie ya care queni faile same alcar ole ambe úvea.
For in this matter, that which formerly had glory now does not have glory at all, by reason of the glory that surpasses it.	An mi natto sina, ta ya yá sáme alcar sí ua same alcar aqua, castanen i alcaro ya lahta sa.
For if that which was going to fade was established in glory, much more will that which remains have glory.	An qui ta ya firumne náne tulcaina mi alcar, ole ambe ta ya lemya samuva alcar.
Therefore, since we have such hope, we are very bold,	Etta, pan samilve taite estel, nalve ita canye,
and we do not do like Moses, who put a veil on his face, to stop the Children of Israel from seeing the end of the fading glory.	ar ualve care ve Móses, ye panyane vaşar cendeleryasse, pustien i Israelindi ceniello metta i fifírula alcaro.
But their mind was made hard. For until this day the same veil remains and is not lifted at the reading of the old covenant, since it is put away by means of the Christ.	Mal sámalta náne cárina hranga. An tenna aure sina i imya vaşar lemya ar ua ortaina i hentiesse i yára véreva, pan nas panyaina oa i Hristonen.
Indeed until this day, whenever Moses is read, a veil lies upon their heart.	É tenna aure sina, quiquie Móses ná hentaina, vaşar caita endaltanna.
But when they turn to the Lord, the veil is taken away.	Mal íre querilte inte i Herunna, i vaşar ná mapaina oa.
But the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Lord's spirit is, is freedom.	Mal i Heru ná i Faire, ar yasse i Heruo faire ea, ea lérie.
And when all among us, without veil covering our face, give back the Lord's glory like a mirror, we are changed into his appearance, from glory to glory – as is done by the Lord, the Spirit.	Ar íre illi mici vi, ú vaşaro tópala cendelelva, nanantar i Heruo alcar ve cilintilla, nalve vistaine mir ilcerya, alcarello alcarenna – ve ná cárina lo i Heru, i Faire.
Therefore, since we have this ministry by the grace given us, we do not abandon our courage.	Etta, pan samilme núromolie sina i Erulissenen antaina men, ualme hehta huorelma.
But we have abandoned the hidden things that cause humiliation , for we do not behave with cunning. Furthermore, we do not falsify God's word, but by showing the truth we give ourselves good witness before the face of God, to the conscience of all men.	Mal ehehtielme i nurtaine nati yar talar nucumie, an ualme lenga curunen. Ente, ualme ñauta Eruo quetta, mal taniénen i nanwie antalme immen mára vettie epe Eruo cendele, ilye atanion immotuntien.
If our gospel is indeed veiled, it is veiled from that will be destroyed.	Qui evandilyonelma é ná halda, nas halda ho i nauvar nancarne.
For the god of this age has made blind the mind of who do not believe, to stop from shining the light from the gospel of Christ's glory, he who is God's image.	An randa sino aino acárie cénelóra i sáma ion uar save, pustien caltiello i cala ho i evandilyon pa i Hristo alcar, sé ye ná Eruo emma.
For we do not make ourselves known, but Christ Jesus as Lord, while we are your thralls, for the good of Jesus.	An ualme care imme sinwe, mal Hristo Yésus ve Heru, íre elme nar mólildar, Yésuo márien.
"For God is who commanded: ""Let light shine out of darkness"", and he has shone upon our heart, illuminating the knowledge about God's glory in the face of Jesus Christ."	"An Eru ná ye canne: ""Cala á calta et i morniello"", ar sé acaltie endalmanna, calyala i istya pa Eruo alcar mi Yésus Hristo cendele."
But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, causing the abundant power to be from God and not from ourselves.	Mal samilme harma sina cemne venessen, tyárala i úvea túre náve Erullo ar lá elmello.
We are pressed from every direction, but we are not in a place that narrow that we cannot move; we do not know what we are to do, but we are not wholly without escape;	Nalme nírine ilya tiello, mal ualme nómesse ta náha i ualme pole leve; ualme ista mana caruvalme, mal ualme aqua ú uşweo;
we are persecuted, but not without hope; we are thrown down, but we are not undone.	nalme roitaine, mal lá ú estelo; nalme hátine undu, mal ualme nancarne.
Always we suffer in our body the killing of Jesus, that also Jesus' life will be shown in our body.	Illume perperilme hroalmasse i nahtie Yésuva, i yando Yésuo coivie nauva tanaina hroalmasse.
For we that are alive are ever given over to death by reason of Jesus, for the purpose that also Jesus' life will be shown in our mortal flesh.	An elme i nar coirie nar oi antaine olla qualmen castanen Yésuo, i mehten i yando Yésuo coivie nauva tanaina fírima hrávelmasse.
Thus death is at work in us, but life in you.	Sie qualme móla messe, mal coivie lesse.
"But since we have the same spirit of believing – as is written, ""I believed, therefore I spoke"" – we as well believe, and therefore we also speak,"	"Mal pan samilme i imya faire saviéva – ve ná técina, ""Sáven, etta quenten"" – yando elme savir, ar etta yando quetilme,"
knowing that he who raised Jesus will also raise us and will make us stand among you.	istala i sé ye ortane Yésus yando ortuva mé ar tyaruva me tare imíca le.
For everything is for your good, and so the grace, reaching to people ever more numerous, will bring more thanksgiving, to the glory of God.	An ilqua ná márieldan, ar sie i Erulisse, rahtala queninnar oi ambe rimbe, taluva amba hantalenna, Eruo alcaren.
Therefore we do not abandon our courage, but although our outer man is wearing out, our inner man is renewed from day to day.	Etta ualme hehta huorelma, mal ómu etya atanelma yeryea, mitya atanelma ná envinyanta aurello aurenna.
For though the persecution is passing and is not heavy, it is preparing for us an eternal measure of glory ever more abundant,	An ómu i roitie ná autala ar ua lunga, manweas men oira lesta alcaro oi ambe úvea,
while we look not at the visible , but at the invisible. For the things which one sees shall pass, but the invisible ones are eternal.	íre yétalme lá i cénimar, mal i úcénimar. An i nati yar mo cene autuvar, mal i úcénimar nar oire.
For we know that if our house of dwelling on earth will be destroyed, we shall receive a building from God, a house not made with hands, everlasting in heaven.	An istalme i qui coalma mariéva cemende nauva nancarna, camuvalme ataque Erullo, coa lá cárina mainen, oialea mi menel.
For in this our home we do groan, longing to put on ourselves our heavenly home.	An marelma sinasse é ñonalme, milyala panya immesse meneldea marelma.
Thus, after putting that on ourselves, we will not be found naked.	Sie, apa panie sa immesse, ualme nauva hírine helde.
When we exist in this tent we indeed groan under the burden, for we wish, not to put it away, but to put on ourselves the other, causing which is mortal to be devoured by life.	Íre ealme lancoa sinasse é ñonalme nu i cóla, an merilme, lá panya sa oa, mal panya messe i exe, tyárala ya ná fírima náve ammátina i coiviénen.
But that has made for us this thing is God, who has given us the spirit as a security that we will receive it.	Mal ye acárie men nat sina ná Eru, ye ánie men i faire ve varnasse i camuvalmes.
Therefore, always having courage, we know that when we dwell in the body, we are away from the Lord –	Etta, illume arwe huoreo, istalme i íre marilme i hroasse, nalme oa i Herullo –
for we walk by faith, not by seeing.	an vantalme saviénen, lá ceniénen.
But we have courage and wish more to be away from the body and to dwell with the Lord.	Mal samilme huore ar merir ambe náve oa i hroallo ar mare as i Heru.
Therefore our goal is that if we will be pleasing to him, not heeding if we dwell with him or away from him.	Etta mehtelma ná i nauvalme írime sen, lá címala qui marilme óse hya oa sello.
For all among us shall stand before the judgement seat of the Christ, and so everyone will receive his reward for the things done in the flesh, good or bad.	An illi mici vi taruvar epe i námohamma i Hristova, ar sie ilquen camuva paityalerya i natin cárine i hroanen, máre hya ulce.
Therefore, knowing the fear of the Lord we lead men to our beliefs, but we have been made manifest to God. But we have the hope that we will also be manifest to your conscience.	Etta, istala i rucie i Herullo tulyalme atani savielmannar, mal anaielme cárine úfanwie Erun. Ono samilme i estel i nalme yando úfanwie immotuntieldan.
We do not give ourselves good witness before you, but we give you an opportunity to praise yourselves by means of us, for you to have an answer to that praise themselves for outer appearance, but not for the heart.	Ualme anta immen mára vettie epe le, mal antalme len ecie laitien inde elmenen, samieldan hanquenta in laitar inte etya ilcen, mal lá i endan.
For if we were out of our mind, that was for God; if we had health of mind, that is for you.	An qui anelme ettesse sámalmo, ta náne Erun; qui sámelme mále sámo, ta ná elden.
For the Lord's love compels us, for so we have judged: One died for numerous ones, indeed all died,	An i Hristo melme mauya men, an sie anámielme: Er qualle rimbalin, é illi qualler,
and for all he died, wishing that they that are alive will not more have life for themselves, but for him that died for them and was raised.	ar illin qualles, mérala i té i nar coirie uar ambe samuva coivie inten, mal sen ye qualle tien ar náne ortaina.
Therefore from now we do not know anybody by the flesh. Also if we have known the Christ by the flesh, we do not know him so more.	Etta ho sí ualme ista aiquen i hrávenen. Yando qui isintielme i Hristo i hrávenen, ualme ista se sie ambe.
Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creature; the old have gone away; behold! new ones have come.	Etta, qui aiquen ná i Hristosse, náse vinya onna; i yárar avánier; yé, utúlier vinyali!
But everything is from God, who made peace between himself and us through Christ and gave us the ministry of peace-making.	Mal ilqua ná i Ainollo, ye carne raine imbi inse ar elme ter Hristo ar antane men i núromolie rainecariéva.
Thus it is possible for God by the Christ to make peace between himself and the world, not counting against them their crimes, and he gave the word of peacemaking to us.	Sie ece Erun i Hristonen care raine imbi inse ar i mar, lá nótala téna ongweltar, ar antanes i quetta rainecariéno men.
Therefore we are representatives on behalf of Christ, as if God made request through us. In Christ's place we urge: Make peace between you and God!	Etta nalme ráqueni rá Hriston, ve qui Eru carne arcande ter me. Hristo mende hortalme: Cara raine imbi lé ar Eru!
He that did not know sin he made sin for us, for us to be God's righteousness through him.	Sé ye ua sinte úcare carnes úcare elven, návelvan Eruo failie ter sé.
Laboring with him we also urge you: Do not receive God's grace for nothing! 	Mólala óse yando hortalme le: Áva came Eruo lisse muntan!
"For he says: ""In a desirable time I heard you, and on the day of salvation I helped you!"" Behold, now is the desirable hour! Behold, now is the day of salvation!"	"An quetis: ""Írima lúmesse lye-hlassen, ar i auresse rehtiéva lye-manyanen."" Yé, sí ea i írima lúme! Yé, sí ea i aure rehtiéva!"
We do not do anything at all which will turn people away, not wishing that our ministry will be stained.	Laume carilme aiqua ya queruva queni oa, lá mérala i núromolielma nauva vahtaina.
But in every manner we get good witness as God's servants – in great steadfastness, in tribulations, in needs, in difficulties,	Mal mi ilya lé ñetilme mara vettie ve Eruo núror – túra voronwiesse, şangiessen, mauressen, hrangiessen,
in beatings, in disturbances, in toilings, in nights without sleep, in lacking food,	palpiessen, mandossen, perestiessen, mótiessen, lómissen ú húmeo, peniessen matsova,
in purity, in knowledge, in patience, in gentleness, in holy spirit, in love without hypocrisy,	poiciesse, istyasse, cólesse, moiciesse, aire feasse, melmesse ú imnetiéno,
in truthful speech, in God's power, having the weapons of judice in right hand and left hand,	nanwa questasse, Eruo túresse, arwe i carmar failiéva mi forma yo hyarma,
in glory and shape, having a good name and an evil name, as people who make others err and yet are trusty,	alcaresse ar naityalesse, arwe mára esseo hya ulca esseo, ve queni i tyarir exi ranya ananta nar sarte,
as unknown and yet well known, as dying and behold! we are alive, as receiving chastisement and yet not slain,	ve úsinwe ananta mai sinwe, ve quálala ar yé! nalme coirie, ve cámala paimesta ananta lá nance,
as having grief, but ever full of joy, as poor, but making numerous ones rich, as if we have nothing and yet have everything.	ve arwe nyéreo, mal oi quante alasseo, ve penye, mal cárala rimbali lárie, ve qui samilme munta ananta samir ilqua.
Our mouth is open to you, Corinthians, our heart is widened!	Antonya ná láta len, Corintyar, endanya ná palyaina!
You are not in a narrow place with us, but your own heart is narrow.	Elde uar mi náha nóme aselme, mal véra endalda náha ná.
Therefore, in order to give us the same that we give to you, widen your heart!	Etta, antien men i imya ya elme antar len, á palya endalda!
Do not be put under an uneven yoke with the people that do not believe. For what is that justice and lawlessness have together? Or what is the community between light and darkness?	Áva na panyaina nu alavéla yanta as queni i uar save. An mana ná ya failie ar şanyelórie samir uo? Hya mana i uome imbi cala ar mornie?
"And how can Christ and Belial be of one mind? Or what part does a person who believe have with a person that does not believe? For we are a temple of the Living Deity, as God has said: ""I shall dwell with them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they will be my people."	"Ar manen polir Hristo ar Vélial náve er sámo? Hya mana ranta same quén ye save as quén ye ua save? An elve nar corda i Coirea Ainova, ve Eru equétie: ""Maruvan aselte ar vantuvan imíca te, ar inye nauva Ainolta, ar té nauvar lienya."
"Therefore pass away from them and leave,"" says the Lord, ""and do not touch the unclean, and I shall receive you."	"Etta á auta tello ar á lenweta,"" quete i Héru, ""ar áva appa i úpoica, ar inye camuva le."
"For I shall be for you a Father, and you shall be for be sons and daughters,"" says the Lord Almighty."	"Ar inye nauva len Atar, ar elde nauvar nin yondoli ar yeldeli,"" quete i Héru Ilúvala."
Therefore, since we have these promises, beloved ones, let us cleanse ourselves from every stain of flesh and of spirit, seeking perfect holiness, in the fear of God.	Etta, pan samilve vandar sine, meldar, alve poita inwe ilya vaxello hráveo ar faireo, cestala ilvana aire, ruciesse Erullo.
Widen your heart to us! To no one have we done evil, no one have we marred, by no one have we received profit!	Ámen palya endalda! Úquenen acárielme ulco, úquen ahastielme, úquennen acámielme ñetie!
So I do not speak in order to judge you evil, for I have spoken beforehand that you are in our heart, together for death and for life.	Sie uan quete namien le ulce, an equétien nóvo i nalde endalmasse, uo qualmen ar coivien.
I have great freedom of speech toward you, great boasting by you. I am filled with comfort, I have abundant joy in all our persecution.	Samin túra lérie quetiéva len, túra immolaitie eldenen. Nanye quátina tiutalénen, samin úvea alasse mi ilya roitielma.
Indeed we did not have rest for the body when we came to Macedonia – were outer quarrels, internal fears.	É ualme sáme sére i hroan íre túlelme Maceronianna – enger etye costiéli, mitye ruciéli.
And yet God, who comforts the lowly ones, comforted us by the coming of Titus,	Ananta Eru, ye tiuta i naldar, tiutane mé Títo tuliénen,
and yet not by his coming alone, but also by the comfort with which he was comforted concerning you, when he told how you long, how you have grief, how your spirit burns for me – which caused me to have joy still greater.	ananta lá tulieryanen erinqua, mal yando i tiutalénen yanen anes tiutaina pa elde, íre nyarnes manen milyalde, manen samilde nyére, manen şúlelda urya nin – ya tyarne ni same alasse en ambe túra.
And yet if I gave you grief with my letter , I do not have second thoughts about it. I had second thoughts formerly – for I see that my letter caused you grief, though for a short time only –	An yando qui antanen len nyére mentanyanen, uan same attie sanweli pa sa. Sámen attie sanweli yá – an cenin i mentanya tyarne len nyére, ómu şinta lúmen eryave –
and yet I am happy now, not since you had grief, but since the grief led you to a change of mind . For the grief that you had was of God, that nothing will be lost to you because of us.	ananta nanye valima sí, lá pan sámelde nyére, mal pan i nyére le-tulyane inwistenna. An i nyére ya sámelde náne Eruo, i munta nauva len vanwa elmenen.
For the grief that is of God causes a mind-change concerning which no one can have second thoughts, but the world's grief causes death.	An i nyére ya ná Eruo tyare inwis pa ya úquen pole same attie sanwi, mal i mardo nyére tyare qualme.
For behold! this thing itself – that you had grief which is of God – how great is the urgency that it has caused! How you stood up for yourselves! How you are provoked! How you long! How your spirit burns! How you wish to punish evil! In everything you have shown yourselves clean in this matter.	An yé! nat sina imma – i sámelde nyére ya náne Eruo – manen túra ná i horme ya atyáries! Manen atárielde ama inden! Manen horyalde! Manen milyalde! Manen şúlelda urya! Manen merilde paimeta ulco! Ilquasse atánieldexer poice natto sinasse.
Though I wrote to you I indeed did not do so for the good of the person who did evil, or for the person who suffered the evil, but I wrote to make your urgency for us easily seen among you, before God.	Ómu tencen lenna é uan carne sie márien i queno ye carne ulco, hya i quenen ye perpére i ulco, mal tencen carien hormelda elmen aşcénima imíca le, epe Eru.
Therefore we have been comforted.But added to our comfort we have also joy still more abundant by the joy of Titus, for his spirit has been renewed by you all.	Etta anaielme tiutaine.Mal napánina tiutalelman sámelme alasse en ambe úvea Títo alassenen, an fairerya anaie envinyanta lo le illi.
For if I have praised him before you, I have not been shamed, but as we have said all things to you in truth, so also our praise before Titus has been shown true.	An qui alaitien le epe se, uan anaie naityana, mal ve equétielme ilye nati len nanwiesse, sie yando laitalelma epe Títo anaie tanaina nanwa.
Furthermore, he has still more profound feelings towards you when he recalls how you heeded his commands, how you received him in fear and trembling.	Ente, samis en ambe tumne felmeli lenna íre enyalis manen cimnelde canwaryar, manen camneldes ruciesse ar paliesse.
I find joy in the knowledge that in every manner I can have courage by means of you.	Hirin alasse i istyasse i mi ilya lé polin same huore eldenen.
Now we are making known to you, brothers, the grace that God has given to the congregations of Macedonia.	Sí cáralme sinwa len, hánor, i lisse ya Eru ánie Maceronio ocombin.
For when they suffered a great test by tribulation, their abundance of joy and their profound poverty made abundant the rich desire of giving that they had.	An íre perpérelte túra tyastie şangiénen, úvelta alasseva ar tumna penielta carnet úvea i lárea merie antiéva ya sámelte.
For they gave as was possible to them; indeed I am a witness that they gave beyond what was possible for them, and by their own will.	An antanelte ve ence tien; é nanye astarmo i antanelte han ya ence tien, ar véra nirmeltanen.
They petitioned us with many petitions, wishing to receive the grace of having a part in the service for the holy ones.	Arcanelte me rimbe arcandelínen, mérala came i lisse samiéva ranta i núromoliesse i airin.
They did not gave only according to the hope that we had, but firstly they gave themselves to the Lord and to us, by God's will.	Ualte antane eryave ve i estel ya sámelme, mal minyave antanelte inte i Herun ar elmen, Eruo indómenen.
Therefore we urged Titus that he was going to complete the gift that he formerly started to collect among you.	Etta hortanelme Títo i telyumnes i anna ya yá yestanes hosta imíca le.
Like you are abundant in everything – in faith and word and knowledge and all urgency, and in the love that we have for you – may you also be abundant in your giving!	Ve nalde úvie mi ilqua – mi savie ar quetta ar istya ar ilya horme, ar mí melme ya samilme len – nai nauvalde yando úvie mi antielda!
I do not say that as a command, but by the urgency of others I want to test if your love is also true.	Uan quete ta ve canwa, mal exion hormenen merin tyasta qui melmelda ná yando nanwa.
For you know the grace of Jesus Christ our Lord – that although he was rich he was made poor for your good, for you to be made rich by his poverty.	An istalde Yésus Hristo Herulvo lisse – i ómu anes lárea anes cárina penya márieldan, náveldan cárine lárie penieryanen.
And concerning that I give my thoughts, for that will be beneficial for you who began, not the doing alone, but also your wishing to do it, one year ago.	Ar pa ta antan sanwenyar, an ta nauva aşea elden i yestaner, lá i carie erinqua, mal yando merielda caritas, er loa yá.
Now, then, complete also the doing! As you were willing to do it, so is also good if you complete it, out of which you have.	Sí, tá, á telya yando i carie! Tambe anelde mérala caritas, síve yando mára ná qui telyaldes, et yallo samilde.
For if is the will, it is desirable by which one has, not by which one does not have.	An qui ea i nirme, nas írima yanen mo same, lá yanen mo ua same.
For my goal is not that others will be helped, while things are difficult for you,	An mehtinya ua i exi nauvar manyaine, íre nati nar urde len,
but that all will be equal. At this time you have abundance and can help who suffer need. At another time they will have abundance and can help you, when you suffer need. Thus all will be equal,	mal i illi nauvar vávie. Lú sinasse elde samir úve ar polir manya i perperir maure. Mi hyana lú té samuvar úve ar polir manya lé, íre elde perperir maure. Sie illi nauvar vávie,
"as is written: ""The person having much did not have too much, and the person having little did not have too little."""	"ve ná técina: ""I quén arwa olyo ua sáme acca olya, ar i quén arwa pityo ua sáme acca pitya."""
Thanks to God, since he put the same urgency for you in the heart of Titus,	Hantale Erun, pan panyanes i imya horme elden Títo endasse,
for he received the urgency, and since he set out with great vigor , he is going to you by his own choice.	an camnes i hortale, ar pan horyanes ole, ménas lenna véra cilmeryanen.
But we are sending with him a brother whose praise has spread through all the congregations because of his work for the gospel.	Mal mentealme óse háno yeo laitale ivintie ter ilye i ocombi molieryanen i evandilyonen.
Not that alone, but he was also placed by the congregations as my companion, going with us while we carry the collection that we oversee, to the glory of God and to show our good will.	Lá ta erinqua, mal anes yando panyaina lo i ocombi ve sartonya, lelyala aselme ire colilme i hostie ya ortirilme, Eruo alcaren ar tanien mára nirmelma.
We want to stop anyone from speaking evil about us concerning the gift that we have in our keeping,	Merilme pusta aiquen quetiello ulco pa me pa i anna ya samilme hepielmasse,
for our goal is that we will do which is good, not in the Lord's eyes alone, but also in men's eyes.	an mehtelma ná i caruvalme ya mára ná, lá mí Heruo hendu erinque, mal yando mi atanion hendu.
Furthermore, we send with them our brother, whom we frequently have tested in numerous matters and have found that he shows urgency in his work. He firmly believes that you are trusty, and therefore he works with still greater urgency.	Ente, mentalme aselte hánolma, ye rimbave atyastielme rimbe nattolissen ar ihírier i tanas horme molieryasse. Savis tancave i nalde sarte, ar etta molis en ambe túra hormenen.
Concerning Titus: His share is with me, and he works with me for your good. Concerning the other brothers, they are sent by the congregtaions and are Christ's glory.	Pa Títo: Masserya ná asinye, ar molis asinye márieldan. Pa i hyane hánor, nalte mentaine lo i ocombi ar nar Hristo alcar.
Therefore show them your love and let them know that I praised you before the congregations for a good reason.	Etta á tana tien melmelda ar lava tien ista i le-laitanen epe i ocombi mára castanen.
Now concerning the ministry for the holy ones: I do not have real reason to write to you,	Sí pa i núromolie i airin: Uan same anwa maure tecien len,
for I know that you are willing. Therefore I praise you in Macedonia, saying that Achaia was ready one year ago, and your burning spirit has spurred the majority .	an istan i nalde mérala. Etta le-laitan Maceroniasse, quétala i Acaia náne manwa er loa yá, ar uryala şúlelda avaltie i amarimbar.
But I am sending the brothers, that my praise concerning you will not be empty in this matter, but as I have said you will indeeed be ready.	Mal mentean i hánor, i laitalelma pa elde ua nauva lusta pa natto sina, mal ve equétien é nauvalde manwe.
I do not wish that people are to come from Macedonia with me and will find you unprepared, for so we – not to say you – will be humiliated because we were so sure.	Uan mere i tuluvar quelli Maceroniallo asinye ar hiruvar le úmanwaine, ar sie elme – lá quetien elde – nauvar nucumne pan anelme ta tance.
Therefore I thought that it was necessary to send the brothers before me to you, to make ready beforehand the blessed gift of which you gave promise formerly. Thus it will indeed be ready as a blessed gift, and not by compulsion.	Etta sannen i mauyane menta i hánor epe ni lenna, carien manwa nóvo i aistana anna pa ya antanelde vanda yá. Sie é nauvas manwa ve aistana anna, ar lá maustanen.
What I am saying is this: He who sows little will also have a small harvest, and he that sows an abundance will also have an abundant harvest.	Ya quétan ná si: Sé ye rere pitya yando samuva pitya yávie, ar sé ye rere úve yando samuva úvea yávie.
Let everyone do as he has chosen in his heart, not grumbling or by compulsion, for God loves that is happy to give.	Lava ilquenen care ve icílies endaryasse, lá nurrula hya maustanen, an Eru mele ye ná valima antien.
And God can give you every grace in abundance, to case you to always have everything in sufficiency and an abundance for every good deed,	Ar Eru pole anta len ilya lisse úvesse, tyarien le illume same ilqua fáresse ar úve ilya mára cardan,
"as has been written: ""He has scattered, he has given to poor ones; his righteousness remains forever."""	"ve anaie técina: ""Ivinties, ánies penyain; failierya lemya tennoio."""
But who gives seed to who sows and bread for eating will give you your seed and will make it abundant, and the fruits of your righteousness he will make rich.	Mal ye anta erde yen rere ar masta matien antuva len erdelda ar caruva sa úvea, ar failieldo yávi caruvas lárie.
In everything you are made rich, allowing you to give freely in every manner, and so God will receive thanksgiving by means of you.	Mi ilqua nalde cárine lárie, lávala len anta lérave mi ilya lé, ar sie Eru camuva hantale elvenen.
For this ministry is not done solely to fill the needs of the holy ones, but it also causes an abundance of thanksgiving to God.	An núromolie sina ua carna eryave quatien i airion mauri, mal tyaris yando úve hantaléva Erun.
This ministry shows your faithfulness when you are tested. Therefore you give glory to God, since you subject yourselves the gospel of Christ, as you openly say that you do, and you give freely to them and to all.	Núromolie sina tana voronwelda íre nalde tyastaine. Etta antalte alcar Erun, pan panyaldexer nu i Hristo evandilyon, ve pantave quetilde i carilde, ar antalde lérave tien and illin.
They pray for you and long for you, by reason of the surpassing grace that you have.	Hyamilte len ar milyar le, castanen i lahtala Erulisseo ya samilde.
Thanks to God for his gift beyond words!	Hantale Erun annaryan quettar pella!
"In the quiet and gentle manner of Christ I, Paul, beg of you – I who am ""timid"" when I see you face to face, but ""bold"" towards you when I am not there with you."	"Mí Hristo quilda ar moica lé inye, Paulo, ique lello – inye ye ná ""caurea"" íre cenin le cendelello cendelenna, mal ""canya"" lenna íre uan tasse aselde."
Indeed I beg of you that when I shall come it will not be necessary for me to behave in the bold manner that I foresee, against who think that we walk by the flesh.	É iquin lello i íre tuluvan ua mauyuva nin lenga mí canya lé ya apacenin, innar sanar i vantalme i hrávenen.
For though we walk in the flesh, we do not make war by the flesh.	An ómu vantalme i hrávesse, ualme ohtacare i hrávenen.
For the weapons of our war-making are not of flesh, but they are mighty by God to overturn fortresses.	An ohtacarielmo carmar uar hráveva, mal nalte túrie Erunen nuquerien artar.
We overturn thought-constructions and every lofty thing that is raised against the knowledge of God, and we put every thought in gaol to cause it to adhere to the commands of the Christ.	Nuquerilme sanweataqui ar ilya varanda nat ya ná ortaina i istyanna Eruo, ar panyalme ilya sanwe mandosse tyarien sa himya i Hristo canwar.
For we shall be ready to punish every deed which is not obedient, after you have been made wholly obedient.	Ar nauvalme manwe paimetien ilya carda ya ua canwacimya, apa elde anaier cárine aqua canwacimye.
You look at things by their appearance. If anyone is certain that he is of the Christ, may he recall that as he is of the Christ, so are also we.	Yétalde nati ilceltanen. Qui aiquen ná tanca i náse i Hristova, nai enyaluvas i tambe sé i Hristova ná, síve yando elme nar.
For also if I praise myself too much concerning the power that the Lord gave to us – to build you up and not to tear you down – I shall not be humbled.	An yando qui laitanyexe acca ole pa i túre ya i Heru antane men – carastien le ama ar lá narcien le undu – uan nauva nucumna.
I do not wish to be perceived as trying to terrify you with my letters.	Uan mere náve tuntaina ve névala ruhta le mentanyainen.
"For, say they: ""His letters are strong and mighty, but when he himself comes, he is weak, and his speech despicable."""	"An, quetilte: ""Mentaryar nar torye ar túrie, mal íre sé immo tule, náse milya, ar questarya nattírima."""
May such people understand that as we are in our letters when we are away, so we are also in deeds when we are with you.	Nai taiti queni hanyuvar i tambe nalme mentalmassen íre nalme oa, síve nalme yando cardassen íre nalme aselde.
For we do not dare to count ourselves among those that speak well of themselves, or compare ourselves with them. When they are their own measure, and compare themselves with themselves, they are not wise.	An ualme verya note imme imíca i quetir mai pa inte, hya sesta imme as té. Íre nalte véra lestalta, ar sestar inte as inte, ualte saile.
But we do not praise ourselves beyond the measure, but by the measure that God has put for us: that we have reached also to you.	Mal elme uar laituvar imme han i lesta, mal i lestanen ya Eru apánie men: i arahtielme yando eldenna.
We have not gone too far praising ourselves, as we were going to do if we did not come to you. But indeed we have come to you bringing the gospel of the Christ.	Ualme eménier acca hairave laitala imme, ve carumnelme qui ualme túle lenna. Mal é utúlielme lenna tálala i Hristo evandilyon.
We do not go beyond our borders by praising ourselves about work done by others, but we have the hope that when your faith grows, we as well will be made mighty among you, by the measure given us. Then we will reach still further,	Ualme mene han rénalmar laitiénen imme pa molie cárina lo exi, mal samilme i estel i íre savielda ale, yando elme nauvar cárine taure imíca le, i lestanen antaina men. Tá rahtuvalme en ambe hairave,
making the gospel known in the countries beyond you. Thus I will not praise myself about work done in another's region, where things are prepared beforehand.	cárala i evandilyon sinwa i nóriessen han le. Sie uan laituva imne pa molie carna exeo ménasse, yasse nati nar manwaine nóvo.
"""But he that praises himself, may he praise himself in the Lord."""	"""Mal ye laitaxe, nai laituvas inse i Hérusse."""
For that gives himself a good witness is not the one that will pass at the test, but he to whom the Lord gives good witness.	An ye anta insen mára vettie ua ye lahtuva i tyestiesse, mal sé yen i Héru anta mára vettie.
I wish that you will allow a small measure of unwisdom from me. But indeed you allow it from me!	Merin i lavumnelde pitya lesta alasailiéva nillo. Mal é lavilde sa nillo!
For my spirit burns for you with a divine burning, for I united you with one husband, for me to lead you to the Christ as a pure virgin.	An şúlenya urya len valaina uriénen, an ertanenye le as er veru, talienyan le i Hristonna ve poica vende.
But now I fear that in this or that manner – like the serpent seduced Eve with its cunning – your minds will be marred and led away from loving the Christ sincerely and with purity.	Mal sí rucin ho i mi sina hya sana lé – ve i leuca şahtane Éve cururyanen – sámaldar nauvar hastaine ar talaine oa meliello i Hristo holmo ar poiciénen.
For you well allow it if a person comes to you and speaks of another Christ – not the same that we made known – or you get a spirit which is not the same that you got formerly, or a gospel which is not the same that you have received.	An lavilde sa mai qui quén tule ar quete pa hyana Hristo – lá i imya ye elme carner sinwa – hya ñetilde faire ya ua i imya ya eñétielde yá, hya evandilyon ya ua i imya ya acámielde.
For I judge that in nothing I fall short of the most lofty apostles.	An namin i muntasse loitan i antare aposteli.
Also if I am unskilled concerning words, I am not so concerning knowledge, but in every manner I have showed that to you.	Yando qui nanye úfinya pa quettar, uan sie pa istya, mal mi ilya lé atánielme ta len.
Surely I did not do a sin when I maked myself lowly in order to elevate you, since unpaid I made God's gospel known?	Lau carnen úcare íre carnenyexe nalda ortien lé, pan úpaityana carnen Eruo evandilyon sinwa?
"From other congrations I ""stole"", receiving support from them to do ministry for you."	"Hyane ocombellon ""pílen"", cámala tulco tello carien núromolie elden."
For when I was with you and had need, I was not a burden for anyone, for my needs were filled by the brothers that came from Macedonia. In every manner I kept myself and shall I keep myself from being a burden to you.	Ar íre engen aselde ar sáme maure, únen cóla aiquenen, an maurenyar náner quátine lo i hánor i túler Maceroniallo. Mi ilya lé hempenyexe ar hepuvanyexe návello cólo len.
As the truth of Christ exists in me, I shall not be stopped from so praising myself in the congrations of Macedonia.	Ve Hristo nanwie ea nisse, uan nauva pustaina sie laitiello imne Maceronio ocombessen.
And how so? Since I do not love you? God knows that I do!	Ar manen sie? Pan uan mele le? Eru ista i carin!
And what I am doing I shall also do, not to give an opportunity to those that desire an opportuniy, for them to be found equal with us in that of which they praise themselves.	Ar ya cáran yando caruvan, lá antien ecie in merir ecie, náveltan hírine vávie aselme mi ta pa ya laitaltexer.
For such men are false apostles, lying workers, changing themselves into Christ's apostles.	An taiti neri nar úanwe aposteli, húrala mólindor, vistala inte mir Hristo aposteli.
And that is not a wonder, for Satan himself changes himself into an angel of light.	Ar ta ua elmenda, an Sátan immo vistaxe mir vala calava.
Therefore it is not a great thing if his servants change themselves into servants of righteousness. But their end shall be that which follows from their deeds.	Etta ua túra nat qui núroryar vistar inte mir núror failiéno. Mal mettalta nauva ta ya hilya cardaltallon.
I say again: Let nobody think that I am a fool! But if you indeed think so, receive me also as if I am a fool, allowing me as well to praise myself in a small measure!	Quetin ata: Lava úquenen sana i nanye auco! Mal qui é sanalde sie, cama ni yando ve qui nanye auco, lávala yando nin laita imne pitya lestasse!
What I say I do not say from the Lord, but like in the manner of a fool, when I praise myself so surely!	Ya quetin uan quete i Herullo, mal ve lénen auco, íre laitanyexe ta tancave!
Since numerous ones praise themselves by the flesh, I as well will praise myself!	Pan rimbali laitar inte i hrávenen, yando inye laituvaxe!
For with joy you allow fools to do their things – you who are so wise!	An mi alasse lavilde aucoin care natiltar – elde i nar ta saile!
You allow it when a person makes you thralls, or devours what you have, or seizes your goods, or raises himself above you, or strikes you to the face!	Lavilde sa íre quén care le móli, hya ammate ya samilde, hya mapa armaldar, hya ortaxe or elde, hya pete le i cendelenna!
I am humbled saying that we have been too weak to do that!	Nanye nucumna quétala i elme anaier acca milye carien ta!
But everyting of which anyone dares to praise himself – I am speaking as a fool – I as well dares to praise myself of himself!	Mal ilqua pa ya aiquen verya laita inse – quétan ve auco – yando inye verya laita inse pa ta!
Are they Hebrews? I as well am! Are they Abraham's seed? I as well am!	Ma nalte Heveryar? Yando inye ná! Ma nalte Avrahámo erde? Yando inye ná!
Are they Christ's servants? I speak as if I am out of my mind: I am so still more! I have toiled more, I have been in prison more frequently, I have received more numerous blows, I have been near to death frequently.	Mal nalte Hristo núror? Quetin ve qui nanye ettesse sámanyo: Inye ná sie en ambe! Omótien ambe, anaien mandosse ambe rimbave, acámien ambe rimbe petiéli, anaien hare qualmenna rimbave.
On five occasions I have received from Jews forty blows except one.	Mi lúr lempe acámien Yúrallon petier canaquean hequa er.
Thrice I have been beaten with rods; one time I have been stoned. Thrice the ship on which I was went down; for a night and a day I have been in the deep waters,	Nel anaien palpaina vandillínen; lú er anaien saryaina. Nel i cirya yasse anen lende undu; ter lóme yo aure anaien i núre nenissen,
on numerous journeys, in danger from rivers, in danger from robbers, in danger from my own people, in danger from the other nations, in danger in the city, in danger in the wilderness, in danger at sea, in danger from false brothers,	rimbe lendalissen, raxesse sírellon, raxesse pilullon, raxesse véra lienyallo, raxesse i hyane nórellon, raxesse mí osto, raxesse mí ravanda, raxesse earesse, raxesse úanwe hánollon,
in toiling and difficulty, frequently without sleep, in hunger and thirst, frequently lacking food, being cold and without clothes.	mi mótie ar urdie, rimbave ú húmeo, maitiesse ar soiciesse, rimbave pénala matso, nála ringa ar ú lannion.
And added to the things on the outside is also the daily pressure upon me, the anxiety for all the congregations.	Ar napánina i natin i ettesse ea yando i ilaurea nirie ninna, i quárele ilye i ocombin.
Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is caused to fall and I do not burn?	Mal ná milya, ar inye ua milya? Man ná tyarna lanta ar inye ua urya?
If it is necessary that I shall praise myself, I will praise myself concerning the things in which I am weak.	Qui mauya i laituvanyexe, laituvanyexe pa i nati yassen nanye milya.
The God and Father of Jesus Christ our Lord, indeed who shall be blessed forever, knows that I am not lying.	Yésus Hristo Herulvo Aino ar Atar, é ye nauva laitana tennoio, ista i uan húra.
In Damascus the governor under king Aretas watched the city of the Damascenes to seize me,	Lamascusse i nóretur nu aran Aretas tirne i Lamascearon osto ni-mapien,
but through a hole in the wall I was sent down in a box and escaped out of his hands.	mal ter assa i rambasse anen mentaina undu colcasse ar úşe et máryalto.
It is necessary for me to praise myself. It is not beneficial, but now I shall come to visions and revelations of the Lord.	Mauya nin laita imne. Uas aşea, mal sí tuluvan ceniennar ar apantiennar i Heruva.
I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago – in the body or outside of the body I do not know, God knows – was taken away to the third heaven.	Istan nér mi Hristo ye loar canaque yá – i hroasse hya ettesse i hravo uan ista, Eru ista – náne mapaina oa i nelya menelenna.
Indeed I know such a man – in the body or outside of the body I do not know, God knows –	É istan taite nér – i hroasse hya ettesse i hravo uan ista, Eru ista –
he was taken away to paradise and heard unutterable words, which a man may not speak.	anes mapaina oa Erumanna ar hlasse avaquétime quettali, yar atan ua lerta quete.
Concerning such a man I will praise myself, but not concerning myself, except concerning my weak state.	Pa taite nér laituvanyexe, mal lá pa inye, hequa pa milya sómanya.
For if I indeed want to praise myself, that was not going to make me a fool, for I would speak the truth. But I do not, to stop anyone from thinking about me more highly than which he sees that I am, or he hears from me.	An qui é merin laita imne, ta ua carumne ni auco, an quetumnen i nanwie. Mal laian, pustien aiquen saniello pa ni tárave lá ya cenis i nanye, hya hlaris nillo.
To stop me from being haughty by the abundance of revelation I have received a thorn in the flesh, an angel of Satan, for it to strike me; thus I will not be too haughty.	Pustien ni návello turquima i úvenen apantiéva acámien necel i hrávesse, Sátan vala, petieryan ni; sie uan nauva acca turquima.
Concerning that I requested of the Lord thrice that it would go away from me,	Pa ta arcanen i Herullo nel i autumnes nillo,
"but the Lord said to me: ""My grace suffices for you, for my power is made perfect in a weak state."" With greatest joy, therefore, I praise myself about my weak state, causing the Christ's power to lie upon me."	"mal i Heru quente ninna: ""Lissenya farya lyen, an túrenya ná carna ilvana milya sómasse."" Mi antúra alasse, etta, laituvanyexe pa milya sómanya, tyárala i Hristo túre caita ninna."
Therefore I am happy when I am weak, when I suffer violence, when I have need, when I am persecuted or in difficulties, for Christ. For when I am weak, then I am strong.	Etta nanye valima íre nanye milya, íre perperin orme, íre samin maure, íre nanye roitaina hya urdiessen, Hriston. An íre nanye milya, tá nanye torya.
I have been a fool! You compelled me to be so, for what you owed me was to speak well about me. For in nothing I fall short of the loftiest apostles, though I am nothing.	Anaien auco! Elde mauyaner nin náve sie, an rohtalda nin náne quete mai pa ni. An mi munta loitan i antare aposteli, ómu nanye munta.
The signs of a true apostle was done among you with all patience, with signs and wonders and powerful deeds.	Nanwa apostelo tanwar náner cárine mici le ilya cólenen, tanwalínen ar elmendalínen ar túrie cardar.
For in what were you made less than the other congrations, except that I was not a burden to you? Forgive me this injustice!	An mi mana anelde cárine pitye lá i hyane ocombi, hequa i inye úne cólo len? Ánin apsene úfailie sina!
Behold, this is the third occasion that I am ready to come to you. And I will not be a burden, for I do not seek what you have, but I seek you. For children do not have a debt to make store for their parents, but parents for their children.	Yé, si ná i neldea lú yasse nanye manwa tulien lenna. Ar uan nauva cólo, an uan cesta ya samilde, mal cestan lé. An híni uar same rohta care haura ontarultant, mal ontaru hínaltain.
And with joy I will use what I have, and will I be used, for your souls. If I love you the more, will I be loved the less?	Ar mi alasse yuhtuvan ya samin, ar nauvan yuhtaina, fealdain. Qui melin le i ambe, ma nauvan mélina i mis?
But even if that is so, I was not a burden to you – but being foxy perhaps I seized you by a trick?	Mal yando qui ta ná sie, inye úne cólo len – mal nála ruscuite cé nampen le fintalénen?
Surely I did not make profit out of you by anyone that I sent to you?	Lau carnen ñetie et lello aiquennen ye mentanen lenna?
I urged Titus and sent the brother with with. Surely Titus did not make profit out of you? Did we not walk in the same spirit, in the same path?	Hortanen Títo ar mentane i háno óse. Lau Títo oi carne ñetie et lello? Ma uamme vantane i imya fairesse, i imya tiesse?
Did you for this whole time think that to you we stand up for ourselves? to God, in Christ, we speak! But everything, my beloved, is in order to build you up.	Ma ter quanda lúme sina asánielde i elden tarilme ama inwen? Erunna, i Hristosse, quetilme! Mal ilqua, meldanyar, ná carastien le ama.
For I fear that when I shall come, I will not find you as I can wish, and I will not be to you like you can wish, but instead will be in this or that manner quarrelings, envies, angry feelings, strifes, evil speaking about others, whisperings, pride, a disordered state.	An rucin ho i íre tuluvan, uan hiruva le ve polin mere, ar inye ua nauva len ve elde polir mere, mal i mende euvar mi sina hya sana lé costier, hrúceni, rúşie felmi, costi, ulca quetie pa exi, hlustier, valatie, rúcina sóma.
Perhaps, when I shall return, my God will humiliate me among you, and it will be necessary for me to have grief concerning numerous ones that sinned formerly and have not found repentance concerning the uncleanness and the fornication and the loose conduct with which they have behaved.	Cé, íre entuluvan, Ainonya nucumuva ni mici le, ar mauyuva nin same nyére pa rimbali i úcarner yá ar uar ihírie inwis pa i úpoicie ar i hrupuhtie ar i lehta lengie yainen elengielte.
This is the third time that I am coming to you. By the mouth of two or three witnesses every matter will be established.	Si ná i nelya lú yasse túlan lenna. Astarmo atta hya neldeo antonen ilya natto nauva tulcaina.
I have said formerly, when I was with you after I came to you for the second time, and now when I am away I say beforehand to those that have sinned formerly and to all the others: If I ever return I will not show mercy,	Equétien yá, íre engen aselde apa túlen lenna mí attea lú, ar sí íre nanye oa quetin nóvo innar úacárier yá ar ilye i exennar: Qui oi nanwenuvan uan tanuva oravie,
since you seek a sign establishing that by me Christ speaks, he who is not weak towards you but powerful among you.	pan cestalde tanwa tulcala i inyenen Hristo quete, sé ye ua milya lenna mal túrea mici lé.
Indeed he was crucified owing to his weak state, but he is alive by God's power. And indeed we are weak with him, but we shall be alive with him by God's power towards you.	É anes tarwestaina milya sómaryanen, mal náse coirea Eruo túrenen. Ar é elme nar milye óse, mal nauvalme coirie óse Eruo túrenen lenna.
Test yourselves if you are in the faith; be sure about what you are. Or do you not keep in mind that Jesus Christ exists in you? If you have not failed at the test.	Á tyasta inde qui nalde i saviesse; na tance pa mana nalde. Hya ualde hepe sámasse i Yésus Hristo ea lesse? Qui ualde oloitie i tyastiesse.
But I have the hope that you will understand that we have not failed at the test.	Mal samin i estel i hanyuvalde i elme uar oloitie i tyastiesse.
We pray to God that you will do nothing evil, not to show that we have passed when we were tested, but for you to do good, even if will seem that we have failed.	Hyamilme Erunna i caruvalde munta ulca, lá tanien i elme alahtier íre anelme tyestaine, mal carieldan márie, yando qui şéyuva i elme oloitier.
For we can do nothing against the truth; we can solely help the truth.	An polilme care munta i nanwienna; polilme eryave manya i nanwie.
For we are happy when we are weak but you are strong, for for this thing we pray: that you will be made perfect.	An nalme valime íre elme nar milye mal elde nar torye, an nat sinan hyámalme: i nauvalde cárine ilvane.
Therefore I am writing these things when I am away, to stop myself from behaving in a harsh manner when I shall be with you, by the power that the Lord gave me – to build up and not to tear down.	Etta técan nati sine íre nanye oa, pustien imne lengiello mi naraca lé íre euvan aselde, i túrenen ya i Heru antane nin – carastien ama ar lá narcien undu.
Finally, brothers: Farewell! Be made perfect, be comforted, be of one mind, dwell in peace; and the God of love and of peace will be with you.	Teldave, hánor: Namárie! Na cárine ilvane, na tiutaine, na er sámo, mara rainesse; ar i Aino melmeva ar raineva euva aselde.
Greet one another with a holy kiss!	Á suila quén i exe aire miquenen!
All the holy ones greet you!	Ilye i airi suilar le!
May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and God's love and your share in the Holy Spirit be with all among you!	Nai i Heru Yésus Hristo lisse ar Eruo melme ar masselda i Aire Feasse euvar as illi mici le!
The elder to the chosen lady and to her children, whom I love in truth, and not I alone, but also all who know the truth,	I amyára i cílina herinna ar hínaryannar, i melin nanwiesse, ar lá inye erinqua, mal yando illi i istar i nanwie,
by the truth that is in us, and it shall be with us forever.	i nanwiénen ya ea vesse, ar euvas aselve tennoio.
 will be with us grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Father’s Son, by truth and by love.	Euvar aselve lisse, óravie ar raine ho Eru i Atar ar ho Yésus Hristo, i Ataro Yondo, nanwiénen ar melmenen.
I have the greatest joy because I have found that some of your children walk in the truth, according to the commandent that we received from the Father.	Samin i antúra alasse pan ihírien i queneli hínalyaron vantar i nanwiesse, ve i axan ya camnelve i Atarello.
And now I ask of you, o lady, not as if I am writing to you a new commandment, but that which we had from the beginning: that we love one another.	Ar sí arcan lyello, a heri, lá ve qui técan lyen vinya axan, mal ta ya sámelve i yestallo: i melilve quén i exe.
And this is the love: that we walk according to his commandments. That is the commandment, as you heard from the beginning, in order to walk in it.	Ar si ná i melme: i vantalve ve axanyar. Ta ná i axan, ve ahlárielde i yestallo, vantien sasse.
For many deceivers have gone forth into the world, the ones that do not confess Jesus Christ come in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the Antichrist.	An rimbe útulyandoli eteménier mir i mar, i uar etequenta Yésus Hristo túlienwa i hrávesse. Si ná i útulyando ar i Anahristo.
Watch yourselves, that the we have done will not be lost to you, but you will receive full reward.	Tira inde, i yar acárielve uar nauva len vanwe, mal camuvalde quanta paityale.
Everyone who does not remain in Christ’s teaching, but goes beyond it, does not have God. who remains in the teaching, he has the Father and the Son.	Ilquen ye ua lemya Hristo peantiesse, mal mene han sa, ua same Eru. Ye lemya i peantiesse, sé same i Atar yo i Yondo.
If anyone comes to you not bringing this teaching, do not receive him into your houses, and do not greet him.	Qui aiquen tule lenna lá túlula peantie sina, ávase came mir coaldar, ar áva suila se.
For who greets him has a part with him in his evil deeds.	An ye se-suila same ranta óse ulce cardaryassen.
I have many things to write to you, but I do not want to do so with paper and ink. But I have the hope that I will come to you and speak with you face to face, that your joy will be perfect.	Samin rimbe natali tecien lenna, mal uan mere care sie hyalinnen ar móronen. Ono samin i estel i tuluvan lenna ar quetuva aselde cendelello cendelenna, i alasselda nauva ilvana.
Your chosen sister’s children greet you 	Cílina néşalyo hínar suilar lye.
Simon Peter, slave and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have received a faith as precious as our own, by the righteousness of our God and of our Savior, Jesus Christ.	Símon Péter, Yésus Hristo mól ar apostel, innar acámier savie ve mirwa ve véralma, i faliénen Ainolvo ar Rehtolvo, Yésus Hristo.
May you have grace and peace in abundance, by the knowledge about God and Jesus Christ our Lord,	Nai samuvalde Erulisse ar raine úvesse, i istyanen pa Eru ar Yésus Hristo Herulva,
since by his divine power he has given us everything that leads to life and to piety , by the knowledge about who called us by glory and by goodness.	pan valaina túreryanen ánies ven ilqua ya tulya coivienna ar ainocimienna, i istyanen pa ye vi-yalle alcarnen ar mariénen.
By these things he has given us the precious and greatest promises, for us to have a part in divine nature , after fleeing the marring that is in the world by lust.	Sine natinen ánies ven i mirwe ar antúre vandar, samieldan ranta valaina nasseo, apa uºie i hastie ya ea i mardesse mailenen.
For this reason, with every urgency, you add to your faith goodness, to your goodness knowledge,	Sina castanen, ilya hormenen, alde napane savieldan márie, márieldan istya,
to your knowledge self-control, to your self-control endurance, to your endurance piety,	istyaldan immoturie, immoturieldan voronwie, voronwieldan ainocimie,
to your piety brotherly affection , to your brotherly affection love.	ainocimieldan hánonilme, hánonilmeldan melme.
For if these things exist in you in abundance, they will stop you from being without deeds or fruit after knowing Jesus Christ our Lord.	An qui nati sine ear lesse úvesse, pustuvalte le návello ú cardaron hya yáveo apa istie Yésus Hristo Herulva.
For if these things do not exist in a person, he is blind or short-sighted, and has slipped from his recall how he was cleansed from his sins long ago.	An qui nati sine uar ea mi quén, náse cénelóra hya ºintacénea, ar ataltie enyalieryallo manen anes poitaina úcareryallon andanéya.
Therefore, brothers, do everything that you can to make firm your calling and your choosing, for so doing you shall by no means fall.	Etta, hánor, cara ilqua ya polilde carien tulca yalielda ar cilmelda, an sie cárala laume lantuvalde.
In this way a broad door will be opened to you into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and of our Savior, Jesus Christ.	Sinen landa fenna nauva len letyaina mir i oira aranie Herulvo ar Rehtolvo, Yésus Hristo.
Thus I will always cause you to recall these things, though you know them and are firm in the truth that exists in you.	Etta illume le-tyaruvan enyale nati sine, ómu istaldet ar nar tulce i nanwiesse ya ea lesse.
But when I still exist in this tent I count proper to urge you, by causing you to remember.	Mal íre en ean mi lancoa sina notin vanima hortie le, tyariénen le enyale.
For I know that my tent soon will be put away, as also Jesus Christ our Lord made known to me.	An istan i lancoanya rato nauva panyaina oa, ve yando Yésus Hristo Herulva nin-carne sinwa.
Therefore, with every urgency, I will do what is possible for me, for you to be able to recall these things after my passing.	Etta, ilya hormenen, caruvan ya ece nin, polieldan enyale nati sine apa autienya.
When we told you about the power and the coming of Jesus Christ our Lord, we did not repeat cleverly invented fables; on the contrary, we were bystanders and saw his majesty with our own eyes.	Íre nyarnelme len pa i túre ar i tulie Yésus Hristo Herulvo, ualme enquete fincave autaine nyariéli; úsie, anelme astarmoli ar cenner melehterya vére hendulmanten.
For from God Father he received honor and glory, when words like this were carried to him by the Majestic Glory: «This is my son, my beloved, of whom I have thought well.»	An Eru Atarello camnes laitie ar alcar, íre síti quettali náner cóline senna lo i Meletya Alcar: «Si ná yondonya, meldanya, pa ye inye asánie mai.»
For these words we heard carried to him when we were with him on the holy mountain.	Ar quettar sine hlasselme cóline menello íre anelme óse i aire orontesse.
Therefore we have the word of the Prophets made more firm, and you are doing well in heeding it, as one heeds a lamp shining in a dark place, until day comes and a day-star rises in your heart.	Etta samilve i quetta i Erutercánoron carna ambe tulca, ar cáralde mai cimiesse sa, ve mo cime calma caltala morna nómesse, tenna aure tule ar auretinwe orta endaldasse.
For above everything you know that does not exist prophecy in the Scriptures that comes from anyone's own insight.	An or ilqua istalde i ua ea apacen i Tehtelesse ya tule aiqueno véra tercenello.
For a prophecy was not ever brought by man's will, but some men spoke from God, being carried by Holy Spirit.	An apacen úne oi tulúna atano nirmenen, mal atalli caramper Erullo, nála cóline Aire Feanen.
But there were also some false prophets among the people, as there will be false teachers among you. They will quietly bring in destructive false teachings and deny even the Lord that traded them to himself, bringing a swift destruction upon themselves.	Mal enger yando hurutercánoli imíca i lie, ve euvar hurupeantalli mici lé. Té quildave tulúvar minna nancárala hurupeantiéli ar laluvar yando i Heru ye mancane te insen, túlula linta nancarie intenna.
Furthermore, numerous ones will follow their deeds of loose conduct, and because of them the road of truth will be blasphemed.	Ente, rimbali hilyuvar cardaltar lehta lengiéva, ar ténen i malle nanwiéva nauva naiquétina.
Being greedy, they will use you for their own gain, with lying words. But their judgement from of old does not move slowly, and their destruction is not asleep.	Nála milce, le-yuhtuvalte véra ñételtan, húrala quettalínen. Mal námielta vanwiello ua leve lencave, ar nancarielta ua lorna.
For God did not refrain from punishing the angels that sinned, but threw them into the abyss and gave them over to pits of gloom to be reserved for judgement.	An Eru ua pustanexe paimetiello i vali i úcarner, mal te-hante mir i undume ar antane te olla saptalin huinéva náven sátine námien.
Furthermore, he did not refrain from punishing the ancient world, but kept Noah, herald of righteousness, in safety with seven others when he brought a flood upon a world of wicked people. Furthermore, he judged the cities Sodom and Gomorrah by changing them into dust, making a danger-sign for wicked people in coming ages.	Ente, uas pustanexe paimetiello i enwina mar, mal hempe Noha, tercáno failiéva, mi varnasse as hyane otso ire tulunes oloire mardenna olce quenion. Ente, namnes i ostu Sorom yo Omorra vistiénen tu mir asto, cárala raxetanwa olce quenin túlala randalissen.
But he rescued righteous Lot, who was very troubled by the loose behavior of who stood against law.	Mal etelehtanes faila Lót, ye náne ita tarastaina i lehta lengiénen ion tarner ºanyenna.
For by their lawless deeds, that just man was tormented in his just soul by which he saw and heard when he dwelt among them.	An ºanyelóre cardaltainen, sana faila nér náne ñwalyaina faila fearyasse yainen cennes ar hlasses íre marnes imíca te.
Thus the Lord knows to rescue reverent ones out of trial, but to reserve unjust ones for the day of judgement. Then they will be cut off,	Sie i Héru ista etelehta Erunildar et ºangiello, mal sate úfailar i auren namiéva. Tá nauvalte aucirne,
above everything the people following flesh desiring to stain it, and who despice lordship.	or ilqua i queni hilyala hráve mérala vahta sa, ar i nattirir hére.
Bold, willful, they do not tremble before glorious ones, but blaspheme,	Canye, nirmunque, ualte pale epe alcarinquar, mal naiquetir,
though angels, that are stronger and mightier than them, do not speak harsh words of judgement against them before the Lord.	ómu vali, i nar polde ar taure lá té, uar quete narace quettar namiéva ana te epe i Héru.
But these people, like animals without intellect – born to be seized and destroyed – will be corrupted by their own corruption, by the things of which they know nothing and against which they blaspheme,	Mal queni sine, ve celvar ú handeo – nóne náven mapaine ar nancarne – nauvar hastaine véra hastieltanen, i natinen pa yar istalde munta ar yannar naiquetilte,
doing evil to themselves as a payment for unrighteousness. What they count a joy is to dwell in abundance. They are blots and stains, finding abundant joy in their lying teachings while they make themselves festive with you.	cárala ulco inten ve paityale úfailien. Ya notilte alasse ná marie úvesse. Nalte mordoli ar vaxeli, hírala úvea alasse húrala peantieltassen íre cariltexer merye aselde.
Their eyes always seek a harlot; they cannot keep themselves from sin, and they cause unsteady people to stray. Their heart has learned lust. Accursed children,	Hendultat illume cestat imbacinde; ualte pole hepe inte úcarello, ar tyarilte iltance queni ranya. Endalta apárie maile. Húne hínali,
abandoning the straight road, they have been led into an errant path. They have followed the path of Balaam son of Beor, who loved the reward for wrong-doing,	hehtala i téra malle, anaielte tulyaine mir ránea tie. Ihílielte tierya Valam Veorion, ye méle i paityale uscaren,
but received a rebuke concerning his own law-breaking: A voiceless beast of burden, speaking with a man's voice, stopped the witless journey of the prophet.	mal camne tulcarpie pa véra ºanyeracierya: Ómalóra celva cólava, carpala atano ómanen, pustane i úhandea lenda i Erutercáno.
These men are springs without water, mists carried by storm, and for them the gloom of darkness is reserved.	Neri sine nar ehteléli ú neno, híºiéli cóline raumonen, ar tien i huine morniéva ná sátina.
For they speak big words that do nothing good, and by the desire of the flesh and by loose habits they cause those to stray those that a short time ago fled from the people whose conduct is errant.	An quetilte hoe quettali yar carir munta mára, ar i hráveo írinen ar lehte haimalínen tyarilte ranya i ºintanéya úºer i quenillon ion lengie ná ránea.
Though they give them promises about freedom, they are slaves of corruption. For who is conquered by another, is this other one's slave.	Ómu antalte tien vandali pa lérie, té nar hastaleo móli. An ye ná turúna lo exe, ná sina exeo mól.
For if, after fleeing from the stains of the world, by the knowledge about the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled by these things and are overwon, then the last affairs are more evil to them than the first.	An qui, apa uºie i mardo vaxellon, istyanen pa i Heru ar Rehto Yésus Hristo, nalte ata rembine lo nati sine ar nar turúne, tá i métime nattor nar ulce tien lá i minye.
For if they did not ever know the path of righteousness, that was to them better than turning themselves away from it after knowing the holy commandment given to them.	An qui ualte oi sinte i tie failiéva, tá náne tien arya lá querie inte oa sallo apa istie i aire axan antaina tien.
The saying of the true proverb has happened to them: «The dog has returned to its own vomit, and the pig that was washed, to rolling in the mud.»	I nanwa equesso quetie ten-amartie: «I huo enutúlie véra quamnaryanna, ar i polca ya náne sóvina, pelienna i luxusse.»
Beloved ones, this letter is the second that I am writing to you, in which, as in my first, I stir your heart to a wakeful understanding by reminding you,	Meldar, tenna sina ná i attea ya técan lenna, yasse, ve minyanyasse, valtan sámalda cuiva handenna rentiénen le,
for you to recall the sayings beforehand spoken by the holy prophets and the commandment of the Lord and Savior through the apostles sent to you.	enyalieldan i quetier nóvo quétine lo i airi Erutercánor ar i axan i Heruo ar Rehto ter i aposteli mentaine lenna.
For you know this above everything, that in the last days will come blasphemers speaking mockery, behaving according to their own desires	An istalde si or ilqua, i mí métime auri tuluvar naiquétoli quétala yaiwe, lengala ve vére íreltar
and saying: «Where is this return of which he gave promise? For our fathers are dead, but everything is still as it has been from the beginning of creation.»	ar quétala: «Masse sina entulesse pa ya ánes vanda? An atarilmar nar qualini, mal ilqua ná ena ve anaies ontiéno yestallo.»
By their own desire they do not perceive this, that there existed a heaven and an earth in past, rising out of the waters and in midst of water by God's word,	Véra íreltanen ualte tunta si, i enget menel cemenye vanwiesse, ortala et i nenillon ar endesse neno Eruo quettanen,
and by those waters the ancient world was destroyed, being inundated with water.	ar tane neninen i enwina mar náne nancarna, nála oloiyaina nennen.
But by the same word the heaven and earth that exist now are destined for fire and are reserved for the day of judgement, in which men hostile to God will be destroyed.	Mal i imya quettanen i menel cemenye yat eat sí nát martyaine ruiven ar nát sátine i auren námiéva, yasse atani cotye Erun nauvar nancarne.
But beloved ones, do not fail to perceive this: To the Lord a single day is like a thousand years, and thousand years as a single day.	Mal a meldar, áva loita tunta si: I Hérun erya ré ná ve loar húme, ar loar húme ve erya ré.
The Lord is not slow in fulfilling his promise, as some count slowness, but he shows patience to you, since he does not wish that anyone will be destroyed, but that all will find repentance.	I Héru ui lenca amaquatiesse vandarya, ve quelli notir lencie, mal tanas cóle len, pan uas mere i aiquen nauva nancarna, mal i illi hiruvar inwis.
But the day of the Lord will come as a thief, in which heaven will pass away with a great noice, but the heavenly bodies will melt in a terrible heat, and earth and that have been done in it shall be revealed.	Ono i Heruo aure tuluva ve arpo, yasse menel autuva túra ramesse, mal i meneldie hrondor ticuvar rúcima úresse, ar cemen ar yar anaier cárine sasse nauvar apantaine.
Since all these things will melt away, understand what is the kind of people it is necessary for you to be, by holy deeds and conduct and doings of reverence ,	Pan ilye nati sine ticuvar oa, á hanya mana i nostale quenion ya mauya len náve, airi cardalínen ar lengiénen ar carielínen ainocimiéva,
while you look forward to the Lord's day and speed up the coming of that day, in which heaven, being on fire, melts and the heavenly bodies melt away in a terrible heat.	íre yétalde ompa i Heruo aurenna ar hortar i tulie enta aureo, yanen menel, nála ruivesse, tique ar i meneldie hrondor tiquir oa rúcima úresse.
But by his promise we look forward to a new heaven and a new earth, in which righteousness shall dwell.	Mal vandaryanen yétalve ompa vinya menelenna ar vinya cemenna, yatse failie maruva.
Therefore, beloved ones, since you look forward to these things, do everything that you can to be found without stain or blot, and at peace.	Etta, meldar, pan yétalde ompa sine natinnar, cara ilqua ya polilde náven hírina ú vaxeo hya mordo, ar rainesse.
Furthermore, count our Lord's patience as an opportunity for salvation, just like Paul, our beloved brother, also wrote to you by the wisdom given him,	Ente, nota Herulvo cóle ve ecie rehtiéva, aqua ve Paulo, melda hánolva, yando tence len i sailiénen antaina sen,
speaking of these things as he does in all his letters. But in them are some things that are difficult to understand, which the untaught and the unsteady twist, as they also twist the other Scriptures, to their own undoing.	carpala pa nati sine ve caris ilye tennaryassen. Mal mi tai ear natali yar nar urde hanien, yar i úpeantainar ar i iltancar rícar, ve yando ricilte i hyane tehteler, véra nancarieltan.
Therefore, beloved ones, since you know this beforehand, take heed that you are not led away with them by the error of those who stand against the Law, and fall from your own steadfastness.	Etta, a meldar, pan elde istar si nóvo, cima i ualde tulyaine oa aselte i loimanen ion tarir i ªanyenna, ar lantar véra voronweldallo.
But thrive by the grace and by the knowledge about our Lord and our Savior, Jesus Christ. To him be the glory, now and in the day of eternity alike.	Mal ala i Erulissenen ar i istyanen pa Herulva ar Rehtolva, Yésus Hristo. Na sen i alcar, sí ar oireo auresse véla.
Paul and Silvanus and Timothy to the congregation in Thessalonica, in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.	Paulo ar Silváno ar Timoşeo i ocombenna Şessalonicasse, mi Eru Atarelva ar i Heru Yésus Hristo.
May you have grace and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ!	Nai samuvalde lisse ar raine ho Eru i Atar ar i Heru Yésus Hristo!
We are obliged to always give God thanks concerning you, brothers, as is proper; for your faith is growing extremely quickly, and among you everyone's love of the others is ever more great.	Nalme naute illume anta Erun hantale pa lé, hánor, ve vanima ná; an savielda ála ita lintave, ar mici lé ilqueno melme i exiva oi ambe túra ná.
Therefore we praise ourselves concerning you among God's congregations, by reason of your steadfastness and your faith in all your persecutions and the tribulations that you bear,	Etta elme laitar imme pa lé mici Eruo ocombi, castanen voronwieldo ar savieldo mi ilye roitieldar ar i şangier yar cólalde,
showing forth God's just judgment, for you to be counted worthy of God's kingdom, for which you are indeed suffering.	ettánala Eruo faila namie, náveldan nótine valde Eruo araniéno, yan é perpéralde.
Thus it is just in God's eyes to pay back tribulation to those that cause tribulation to you,	Sie ná faila Eruo hendusse nampaitya şangie in tyarir şangie len,
but to you that suffer tribulation, rest with us when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with his powerful angels	mal elden i perperir şangie, sére aselme íre i Heru Yésus ná apantaina menello as túrie valiryar
in a burning flame, when he brings destruction upon those that do not know God and do not follow the gospel of Jesus our Lord.	mi uryala náre, íre talas nancarie innar uar ista Eru ar uar hilya Yésus Herulvo evandilyon.
They will suffer punishment of eternal undoing away from the Lord and from his glorious strength,	Té perperuvar paime oira nancariéva oa i Herullo ar alcarinqua poldoreryallo,
on the day that he shall come to receive glory among his holy ones and to be watched with wonder by all that believed – for the witness that we gave was believed by yourselves.	i auresse ya tuluvas camien alcar mici airiryar ar náven tíraina elmendanen lo illi i sáver – an i vettie ya antanelme náne sávina lo elde.
For this goal we are indeed always praying for you, praying that our God will count you worthy of his calling and will complete everything that he wants – goodness and deeds of faith – in power,	Tana mehten é hyámalme len illume, arcala i Ainolva notuva le valde yalieryo ar telyuva ilqua ya meris – márie ar cardar saviéno – túresse,
in order to bring glory to Jesus our Lord's name among you.	talien alcar Yésus Herulvo essen mici le.
But, brothers, concerning the return of your Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered to him, we ask of you:	Mal, hánor, pa Yésus Hristo Herulvo entulesse ar návelva comyaine senna, arcalme lello:
Do not be quickly shaken from your wits or stirred, by a spirit's revelation or by a word or by a letter said to come from us, saying that the Lord's day has come.	Áva na lintiénen páline handeldallo hya valtaine, faireo apantiénen hya quettanen hya tecettanen quétina tule mello, quétala in i Heruo aure utúlie.
Let no one so seduce you, since it will not come before the apostasy has come first, and the man of lawlessness will be revealed, the son of destruction .	Lava úquenen sie şahta le, pan uas tuluva nó i oatarie utúlie minyave, ar i nér şanyelóriéva nauva apantaina, yondo nancariéno.
He stands against us and elevates himself over everyone called god or to whom one prays; thus he will sit down in God's temple, showing himself as a god.	Taris venna ar ortaxe or ilquen estaina aino hya yenna mo hyame; sie hamúvas Eruo cordasse, tánala inse ve aino.
Do you not recall that while I was with you, I told you these things?	Ma ualde enyale i lan engen aselde, nyarnen lenna nati sine?
And now you know that is keeping him restrained, for him to be revealed at his own time.	Ar sí istalde ya hépa se hampa, náveryan apantaina véra lúmeryasse.
The secret of lawlessness is working now as well, but solely until who is now standing against it will be taken away.	I fóle şányelóriéva móla yando sí, mal eryave tenna ye sí tára sanna nauva mapaina oa.
And then the lawless person will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will undo with the breath of his mouth, and whom he will bring to nothing when his coming has been made known	Ar tá i şányelóra quén nauva apantaina, ye i Heru Yésus nancaruva antoryo şúlenen, ar ye taluvas muntanna íre tulierya anaie carna sinwa –
– he whose coming is caused by Satan's work, by every mighty deed and sign and lying portent,	sé yeo tulie ná tyárina Sátano moliénen, ilya taura cardanen ar tanwanen ar húrala tengwenen
and every unjust temptation of the ones that will be destroyed , since they did not receive the love of truth, for them to be saved.	ar ilya úfaila úşahtiénen i nancaruvainaiva, pan ualte camne i melme nanwiéva, náveltan rehtaine.
Therefore God gave them over to a powerful error , for them to believe the lie.	Etta Eru antane te olla túrea ranyan, savieltan i huru.
Thus all among them will be judged, since they did not believe the truth, but had joy in unrighteousness.	Sie illi mici te nauvar námine, pan ualte sáve i nanwie, mal sámer alasse úfailiesse.
But for us it is necessary give God thanks concerning you, brothers beloved by the Lord, for God chose you from the beginning for you to be saved, by sanctification of spirit and by faith in the truth	Mal elmen mauya anta Erun hantale pa lé, hánor mélaine lo i Heru, an Eru le-cilde i yestallo náveldan rehtaine, airitiénen faireva ar saviénen i nanwiesse
to which he also called you by the gospel that we bring, for you to have the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ.	yanna yando le-yaldes i evandilyonnen ya talalme, samieldan i Heru Yésus Hristo alcar.
Therefore, brothers, stand firm and abide by the received instructions of which you were instructed – whether by our word or whether by our letter.	Etta, hánor, tara tance ar á himya i cámine peantier pa yar anelde peantaine – qui quettalmanen hya qui tecettalmanen.
Furthermore, may Jesus Christ himself and God our Father, who loved us and gave us eternal comfort and good hope by grace,	Ente, nai Yésus Hristo immo ar Eru Atarelva, ye vi-méle ar antane ven oira tiutie ar mára estel Erulissenen,
comfort your heart and make you firm in every good deed and word.	tiuituva endalda ar caruva le tulce mi ilya mára carda ar quetta.
Finally, brothers, pray on our behalf; thus the Lord's word will still move quickly and will receive glory, as it is doing beside you.	Teldave, hánor, hyama rámen; sie i Heruo quetta levuva lintiénen ar camuva alcar, ve cáras ara lé.
Also pray that you will be delivered from evil and wicked men, for all do not have faith.	Yando hyama i nauvalme etelehtaine ulce ar olce atanillon, an illi uar same savie.
But the Lord is faithful, and he will make you firm and will protect you from the Evil One.	Mal i Heru voronwa ná, ar le-caruvas tance ar le-varyuva i Ulcallo.
Furthermore, we are certain in the Lord concerning you, that you are doing and still will do that we command.	Ente, nalme tance i Herusse pa le, i cáralde ar en caruvar yar canilme.
But the Lord will lead your heart into God's love and the endurance of the Christ.	Nai i Heru tulyulva endalda mir Eruo melme ar i Hristo voronwie.
Now I am commanding you, brothers, by the name of the our Lord Jesus Christ: Keep yourselves away from every brother who walks in an improper manner and not by the custom that you received from us.	Sí cánalme len, hánor, Yésus Hristo Herulvo essenen: Hepa inde oa ilya hánollo ye vanta mi úvanima lé ar lá i situnen ya camnelde mello.
For you know how it is necessary for you to follow in our path, by doing as we did, since we did not behave among you in an improper manner,	An elde istar manen mauya len hilya tielmasse, pan ualme lengane imíca te mi úvanima lé,
or ate anyone's food not paying. On the contrary, by work and by toil, at night and at day, we labored not to put burden on anyone among you.	hya manter aiqueno matta lá paityala. Úsie, moliénen ar mótiénen, lómisse yo auresse, mólelme lá panien cólo aiquenna mici lé.
Not by lacking power, but to make ourselves an example to you, we did so – for you to do as we did.	Lá peniénen túre, mal carien imme epemma len, carnelme sie – carieldan ve elme carner.
For when we were with you, we gave you this command: ”If anyone does not wish to work, he also will not eat.”	"An íre anelme aselde, antanelme len canwa sina: ""Qui aiquen ua mere mole, yando uas matuva."""
For we are hearing that some among you walk in an improper manner, failing to work, but inserting themselves into the matters of others.	An hláralme i queneli mici le vantar mi úvanima lé, loitala mole, mal mittala inte mir i nattor exelion.
To such people we give this command and exhortation by the Lord Jesus Christ: They are to eat their own bread by laboring in silence.	Taiti quenin antalme sina canwa ar hortale i Heru Yésus Hristonen: Á matir véra mastalta moliénen quildesse.
But you, brothers, do not become tired, ceasing to do what is right!	Mal elde, hánor, áva ole lumbe, pustala care ya vanima ná!
But if anyone does not listen to our word through this letter, remember who he is. Stop being with him, for him to be humiliated.	Mal qui aiquen ua lasta quettalmanna ter tecetta sina, rena man náse. Á pusta náve óse, náveryan nucumna.
But do not count him as an enemy, but warn him as a brother.	Ono áva note se ve ñotto, mal ora sen ve háno.
May the Lord of peace himself give you peace always, in every manner. May the Lord be with you!	Nai i Heru raineva immo antuva len raine illume, mi ilya lé. Nai i Heru euva aselde!
This is my greeting by my own hand, which is a sign in every letter: So I write.	Si ná suilienya véra mányanen, ya ná tanwa mi ilya tecetta: Sie tecin.
May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with all among you!	Nai Herulva Yésus Hristo lisse euva as illi mici le!
Paul – apostle of Jesus Christ by God's will, by the promise about the life which is in Jesus Christ –	Paulo – Yesus Hristo apostel Eruo indómenen, i vandanen pa i coivie ya ea Hristo Yésusse –
to Timothy , beloved child: Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.	Timoşeonna, melda hína: Lisse, oravie ar raine ho Eru i Atar ar Hristo Yésus Herulva.
I give thanks to God, to whom I am a servant as were my fathers, having a clean conscience, since I do not ever stop recalling you in my prayers , night and day,	Antan hantale Erun, yen nanye núro ve náner atarinyar, arwa poica immotuntiéno, pan uan oi hauta le-enyale arcandenyassen, lómisse yo auresse,
longing to see you, when I recall your tears, for me to be filled with joy.	milyala cene lye, íre enyalin nírelyar, návenyan quátina alassenen.
For I recall the faith that is in you without hypocricy, and which dwelt first in Lois your grandmother and Eunice your mother, but I am sure that it exists also in you.	An enyalin i savie ya ea lyesse ú imnetyaleo, ar ya marne minyave Lois &harunilyasse ar Eunice amillelyasse, mal nanye tanca i eas yando lyesse.
For this reason I remind you to rekindle like a fire God's gift which is in you, since I put my hands upon you.	Sina castanen rentan lye entinta ve náre Eruo anna ya ea lyesse, pan panyanen mányat to lye.
For God has not given us a timid spirit, but a spirit of power and love and of health of mind.	An Eru ua ánie ven caurea faire, mal faire túreva ar melmeva ar máleva sámo.
Therefore do not be ashamed about the witness of our Lord, or concerning me as his bound one, but have your share in suffering for the gospel, by God's power.	Etta áva na naityana pa i vettie Herulvo, hya pa ni ve nútinarya, mal sama masselya perperiéva i evandilyonen, Eruo túrenen.
He saved us and called us by a holy calling, not by reason of our deeds, but by reason of his own purpose and his grace, given us by Jesus Christ before everlasting times,	Sé vi-rehtane ar vi-yalde aire yaliénen, lá castanen cardanyaron, mal castanen véra &mehtyo ar lisseryo, antaina ven Yésus Hristonen nó oialie lúmeli,
but now it has been made known when our Savior, Jesus Christ, was revealed. He has put an end to death and has shone a light upon life and upon incorruption by the gospel,	mal sí anaies carna sinwa íre Rehtolva, Yésus Hristo, náne apantaina. Sé emétie qualme ar acaltie cala coivienna ar alahastienna i evandilyonnen,
concerning which I have been set aside as a herald and an apostle and a teacher.	pa ya inye anaie sátina ve tercáno ar apostel ar peantar.
For this reason I suffer also these things, but I am not ashamed. For I know the one in whom you have believed, and I am sure that he can guard what is put in my custody until that Day.	Sina castanen perperin yando nati sine, mal uan naityana. An istan i quén yesse asávien, ar nanye tanca i polis tire ya ná panyaina mandonyasse tenna enta Aure.
Be led by the healthy words that you have heard from me, by the faith and love in Jesus Christ.	Na tulyaina lo i quettar máleva ya ahláriel nillo, i saviénen ar melmenen Hristo Yésusse.
Watch the good thing put in your custody, by the holy spirit that dwells in you.	I mána panyaina mandolyasse tira i aire fairenen ya mare vesse.
As you know, all the people from Asia have forsaken me. Among them are Phygellus and Hermogenes.	Ve istal, ilye i queni Asiallo ni-ehehtier. Mici té nar Fihello ar Hermohenes.
May the Lord have mercy on Onesiphorus's house, for frequently he brought me refreshment, and he was not ashamed about my bonds.	Nai i Heru oravuva Onesifóro nossesse, an rimbave talles ninna ceutie, ar únes naityana pa naxenyar.
On the contrary, when he came to Rome, he sought me without rest and found me.	Úsie, íre túles Rómanna, ni-cestanes ú séreo ar hirne ni.
May the Lord let him to find mercy with the Lord on that day. And all the acts of service that he did in Ephesus you know well.	Nai i Heru lavuva sen hire oravie as i Héru enta auresse. Ar ilye i núrocardar yar carnes Efesosse istal mai.
Therefore you be strengthened, my child, by the grace that is by Christ Jesus.	Etta alye na turyaina, hinya, i lissenen ya ea Hristo Yésunen.
And the things that you heard from me through many witnesses, give them to faithful men, for whom it will also be possible to instruct others.	Ar i nati yar hlassel nillo ter rimbe vettoli, á anta tai voronde atanin, in yando ecuva peanta exin.
As a good soldier of Christ Jesus suffer evil with the others.	Ve mára ohtar Hristo Yésuo perpera ulco as i exi.
No one who is a soldier allows himself to be entangled by the commerce of life. Thus he can please the one who made him a soldier.	Úquen ye ná ohtar lave inse náve rembina i mancalenen coiviéva. Sie ece sen fasta ye carne se ohtar.
Furthermore, if anyone runs in a race, he does not receive a crown if he does not run according to the rules.	Ente, qui aiquen nore noriesse, uas came ríe qui uas nore ve i şanyer.
As is necessary, the working farmer is the first who receives a part of the fruits.	Ve mauya, i mólala cemendur ná i minya ye came ranta i yávion.
Fill your mind with my sayings, for the Lord will give you insight concerning all things.	Quata sámalya quetienyainen, an i Heru antuva lyen tercen pa ilye nati.
Recall Jesus Christ, raised from dead, of the seed of David, as made known in my gospel,	Enyala Yésus Hristo, ortaina qualinallon, Laviro erdeo, ve carna sinwa mi evandilinya,
the gospel for which I am suffering and am carrying bonds as an evil-doer. But God's word is not in bonds.	i evandilyon yan perpéran ar cólan naxeli ve ulcarindo. Mal Eruo quetta ua naxessen.
Therefore I am steadfast in everything for the good of the chosen ones, wishing that also they will receive the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory.	Etta nanye voronda ilquasse márien i cílinaron, mérala i yando té camuvar i rehtie ya ea Hristo Yésusse, as oira alcar.
Faithful the word: If we died with him, we will also live with him;	Voronda i quetta: Qui quallelve óse, yando coituvalve óse;
if we are faithful, we will also rule with him; if he deny him, he will also deny us;	qui nalve voronde, yando turuvalve óse: qui lalalves, sé yando laluva vé,
if we are not faithful, he is still faithful, for he cannot deny himself.	qui ualve voronde, sé en voronda ná, an uas pole lala inse.
Make them recall that, and command them before the Lord: Do not quarrel about words, for that is not beneficial, and destroyes who listen.	Áte tyare enyale ta, ar cana tien epe i Heru: Áva costa pa quettar, an ta ua aşea, ar nancare i lastar.
Do everything to put yourself before God as a tested person who works without being ashamed, handling the sword of truth in a skillful manner.	Cara ilqua panien imle epe Eru ve tyastaina quén ye mole ú náveo naityana, mahtala i macil nanwiéva mi finwa lé.
But turn yourself away from empty and unholy sayings, for they lead into ever deeper godlessness,	Mal quera imle oa cumne ar úairi quetiellon, an tulyuvalte mir oi ambe tumna ainolórie,
and their word will spread like rot in flesh. Hymenaeus and Philetus are among them.	ar quettalta vintuva ve quelexie hrávesse. Himenaio ar Fileto nát mici te.
These people have turned themselves from the truth, saying that the resurrection has happened even now, and they make some peoples' faith unsteady.	Queni sine equérier inte i nanwiello, quétala in i enortie amartie yando sí, ar carilte quenelion savie iltanca.
And yet God's firm foundation still stands, having this seal: “The Lord knows his own”, and: “It is necessary for everyone that names the Lord's name to abandon unrighteousness!”	Ananta Eruo tulca talma en tare, arwa lihta sino: “I Héru ista véraryar”, ar: “Mauya ilquenen ye esta i Héruo esse hehta úfailie!”
In a big house there are vessels not only of gold and silver, but also of wood or earthenware, and some vessels for a glorious purpose, but others for a purpose without glory.	Hoa coasse ear veneli lá rie maltava ar telpeva, mal yando toava ar cemne, ar veneli alcarinqua mehten, mal exeli mehten ú alcaro.
Therefore, if anyone purifies himself from them, he will be a vessel for a glorious purpose, hallowed, useful for who has it, prepared for every good deed.	Etta, qui aiquen poita inse ho tai, nauvas vene alcarinqua mehten, airinta, yuhtima yen same sa, manwaina ilya mára cardan.
Therefore, flee from the youthful desires, but pursue righteousness, faith, love, with that call to the Lord out of a pure heart.	Etta, uşa i nessime írellon, mal á roita failie, savie, melme, raine, as i yalir i Herunna et poica endallo.
But turn away foolish and ignorant inquries, knowing that they lead to quarrelings.	Mal quera oa auce ar istyalóre minaşurier, istala i tulyalte costiennar.
But it is necessary that the Lord's slave does not quarrel, but that he is gentle to all, knowing to instruct, restraining himself when he suffers evil,	Ono mauya in i Heruo mól ua costa, mal i náse moica illin, istala peanta, avaleryala inse íre perperis ulco,
gently instructing the hostile ones, for perhaps God will give them a change of mind, leading to knowledge of the truth,	moicave peantala i cotyain, an cé Eru antauva tien inwis, tulyala istyanna i nanwiéva,
and they will return to their keenness of perception out of the Devil's snare, they that were seized by him in order to do his will.	ar entuluvalte laiceltanna et i Arauco remmallo, té i náner mapaine lo sé carien nírarya.
But know this: In the last days difficult times will come.	Mal á ista si: I métime auressen hrange lúmeli tuluvar.
For men will love themselves and will love money , praising themselved – haughty, blaspheming, not heeding parents, thankless, disloyal,	An atani meluvar inte ar meluvar telpe, laitala inte – turquime, naiquetila, lá cimila ontaru, ú hantaleo, úsarte,
without love for their kin, remaining in strife, speaking evil about others, not able to control themselves, wild, without love of good,	ú melmeo nosseltava, lemyala mi cos, quetila ulco pa exi, lá polila ture inte, verce, ú melmeo máriéva,
betrayers, willful, proud, loving their lusts over God,	vartandoli, nirmunque, valatie, melila maileltar or Eru,
having a form of reverence but denying its power; and from such people turn yourself away.	arwe canto ainocimiéva mal váquetila túrerya; ar taiti quenillon quera imle oa.
For from them arise that cleverly enter into houses and snare frail women that carry a burden of sin, led by various desires.	An ho té ortar i fincave tulir mir coar ar rembar nípe nissi i colir cólo úcariva, tulyaine lo alavéle íreli.
They are always learning, but they are not able to ever come to knowledge of the truth.	Illume páralte, mal ualte oi pole tule istyanna i nanwiéno.
As Jannes and Jambres stood against Moses, so also these men stand against the truth, men completely corrupted in their minds, rejected concerning the faith.	Tambe Yannes yo Yambres tarnet Mósenna, síve yando neri sine tarir i nanwienna, atalli aqua hastaine sámaltassen, quérine oa pa i savie.
But they will not come any longer , for their madness will be shown to all, as also was their madness .	Mal ualte tuluva ambe andave, an sámalórielta nauva tanaina illin, ve yando náne sámalórietta.
But you have followed my instruction, my path in life, my aim, my faith, my patience, my steadfastness,	Ono elye ihílie peantienya, tienya coiviesse, mehtinya, savienya, cólenya, melmenya, voronwenya,
my persecutions, my sufferings – like those that happened to me in Antioch, in Iconum, in Lystra – and out of all the Lord has delivered me.	roitienyar, perperienyar – ve tai yar martaner nin mi Antiocía, mi Iconium, mi Listra – ar et ilyallon i Heru etelehtie ni.
Indeed all that wish to have a reverent life in Christ Jesus shall be persecuted.	É illi i merir same ainocimya coivie mi Hristo Yésus nauvar roitaine.
But wicked men and impostors will go into ever deeper evil, causing others to stray and caused to stray.	Mal olce atani ar hurumor menuvar mir oi ambe tumna ulco, tyarila exi ranya ar tyáraine ranya.
But you, remain in the things that you learned and in which you firmly believe, knowing the people from whom you learned them,	Mal elye, á lemya mí nati yar parnel ar yassen tancave savil, istala i queni illon parnel tai,
and that from you were a child you knew the holy scriptures, that can make you righteous for your salvation, by the faith which is by Christ Jesus.	ar i ho anel hína sintel i airi tehteler, yar polir care lye saila rehtielyan, i saviénen ya Hristo Yésunen ná.
All scriptures breathed by God are also beneficial for instruction, for refuting error, for making matters straight, for chastisement in righteousness.	Ilye tehteler şúyaine lo Eru nar yando aşie peantien, querien oa loitie, carien nattor tére, paimestan failiesse.
Thus it is possible for God's man to be wholly able, being prepared for every good deed.	Sie ece Eruo atanen náve aqua polila, nála manwaina ilya mára cardan.
I put upon you the order before God and Christ Jesus, who will judge the living and the dead, and by his apparance and by his kingdom:	Panyan lyesse i canwa epe Eru ar Hristo Yésus, ye namuva i coirear ar i qualinar, ar ilceryanen ar aranieryanen:
Make known the word, stand ready in good times and in times that are not good, turn away error, speak stern words, speak encouragement , having every patience in your teaching.	Á cara sinwa i quetta, tara manwa máre lúmissen ar lúmissen yar uar máre, quera oa loitie, queta narace quettar, queta hortale, arwa ilya cóleo peantielyasse.
For will come a time where they will not tolerate the beneficial teaching, but by their own desires they will gather teachers that tickle their ears,	An tuluva lúme yasse ualte lavuva i aşea peantie, mal vére íreltainen comyuvalte peantari i cityar hlarultat,
and from the truth they will turn themselves away, but they will stray, following lying stories.	ar i nanwiello querulvaltexer oa, mal ranyuvalte, hilyala hurila nyarnar.
But you, keep your keenness of perception in all things, suffer evil, labour as a person making known the gospel, complete your service .	Mal elye, hepa laicelda ilye natissen, perpera ulco, mola ve quén carila sinwa i evandilyon, á telya núromolielya.
For I am also now poured forth as a drink-offering, and the time when I shall be freed is near.	An inye ná yando sí etulyaina ve sucieyanca, ar i lúme yasse nauvan leryaina hare ná.
The good fight I have fought, I have run the race to the end, I have kept the faith.	I mára mahtie amahtien, onórien i norie i mettanna, ehépien i savie.
From now the wreath of righteousnes is reserved for me, that which the Lord shall give to me on that day, but not to me alone, but also all that have loved the revelation of him.	Ho sí i ríe failiéva ná nin sátina, ta ya i Heru antauva nin enta auresse, mal lá inyen erinqua, mal yando illin i emélier i apantie seva.
Do everything that you can to come to me soon!	Cara ilqua ya polil tulien ninna rongo!
For Demas has forsaken me, since he loved this world, and he went away to Thessalonica, Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.	An Lémas ehehtie ni, pan méles Arda sina, ar oantes Şessalonicanna, Hrescens Alatianna, Títo Lalmatianna.
Only Luke remains with me.	Rie Lúcas lemya óni.
Bring Mark and make him come with you, for he is helpful for me in my service .	Á tala Marco ar áse care tule aselye, an náse aşea nin mi núromolienya.
But Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus .	Mal Tihico ementien Efesonna.
When I you come, bring the cloak that I left behind in Troas with Carpus, and the books, above everything the parchments .	Íre tulil, á tala i colla ya hehtanen Troasse as Carpo, ar i parmar, or ilqua i helmaparmar.
Alexander the copper-smith did numerous evils to me – the Lord will pay him back as his deeds are –	Alexander i urustan carne rimbe ulculi nin – i Heru nampaityuva se ve cardaryar nar –
and you as well watch yourself concerning him, for he stood against our words in an extremely hostile manner.	ar yando elye tira imle pa sé, an tarnes quettalmannar mi ita cotya lé.
When I defended myself on the first occasion, nobody helped me, but they abandoend me – may that not be counted against them –	Íre veryanen imne mí minya lú, úquen manyane ni, mal ni-hehtanelte – nai ta ua nauva nótina téna –
but the Lord stood with me and strengthened me, wishing that by me the preaching shall be completed and that all the nations will hear it; and I was delivered from the lion's mouth.	ono i Heru tarne óni ar turyane ni, mérala in inyenen i nyardie nauva telyaina ar in ilye i nóri hlaruvar sa; ar anen etelehtaina i rauro antollo.
The Lord will deliver me from every evil deed and will save me for his heavenly kingdom. To him be the glory forever and ever! Amen!	I Heru ni-etelehtuva ilya olca cardallo ar rehtuva ni meneldea aranieryan. Sen na i alcar tennoio ar oi. Násie!
Greet Prisca and Aquila and the house of Onesiphorus!	Á suila Prisca ar Aquila ar Onesifóro nosse!
Erastus remained in Corinth, but Trophimus I left behind sick in Miletus .	Erasto lemne Corintesse, mal Trofimo hehtanenye hlaiwa Miletosse.
Do everything in order to come before the winter!Eubolus greets you, and so do Pudens and Linus and Claudia and all the brothers.	Cara ilqua tulien nó i hríve!Euvolo suila lye, ar sie cárar Purens ar Lino ar Hlauria ar ilye i hánor.
May the Lord be with your spirit! May his grace be with you! 	Nai i Heru euva as fairelya! Nai lisserya euva aselde!
The elder to Gaius the beloved, whom I love in truth.	I amyára Aio i meldanna, ye inye mele nanwiesse.
Beloved, I pray that in all things you are prosperous and have good health, as your soul is prosperous.	Melda, hyamin i ilye natissen nalye almárea ar samil mále, tambe fealya almárea ná.
For I had the greatest joy when some brothers came and witnessed about the truth that is in you, and how you walk in the truth.	An sámen i antúra alasse íre hánoli túler ar vettaner pa i nanwie ya ea lyesse, ar manen vantal i nanwiesse.
I do not have reason for thanksgiving greater than this: that I hear that my children walk in the truth.	Uan same casta hantalen túra lá si: i hlarin i hínanyar vantar i nanwiesse.
Beloved, you are doing a faithful work in everything that you do for the brothers, also for strangers,	Melda, cáral voronda molie ilquasse ya caril i hánoin, yando etteleain,
who have witnessed about your love before the congregation. Please, send them away in a manner worthy of God.	i evettier pa melmelya epe i ocombe. Iquin, áte menta oa lénen valda Erun.
For on behalf of his name they went forth, not taking anything from people of nations.	An rá esseryan etemennelte, lá mápala aiqua quenillon nórion.
Therefore we must receive such people, that we will work together for the truth.	Etta mauya ven came taiti queni, i moluvalve uo i nanwien.
I wrote some words to the congregation, but Diotrephes, who loves being prominent among them, does not receive anything from us.	Tencen quettali i ocombenna, mal Liotréfes, ye mele náve minda mici te, ua came aiqua mello.
Therefore, if I will come, I will make them remember his deeds that he is doing, chattering about us with evil words. Moreover, since that is not enough for him, he also refuses to receive the brothers, and who want to receive them he tries to stop and to throw them out of the congregation.	Etta, qui tuluvan, tyaruvanyet enyale cardaryar yar cáras, cacarpala pa me ulce quettalínen. Ente, pan ta ui fárea sen, yando váquetis came i hánor, ar i merir camitat nevis pusta ar hatitat et i ocombello.
Beloved, do, not according to what is evil, but according to that which is good. who does good is of God. who does evil has not seen God.	Melda, á care, lá ve ya ulca ná, mal ve ta ya ná mane. Ye care mane Eruo ná. Ye care ulco ua ecénie Eru.
Demetrius has a good witness from all among them, and from the truth itself. Indeed also we are bearing witness, ar you know that our witness is true.	Lemetrius same mára vettie ho illi mici te, ar ho i nanwie imma. É yando elme vettear, ar istalye i menya vettie nanwa ná.
I had many things to write to you , and yet I do not want to write to you with ink and with pen. 	Sámen rimbe natali tecien lyenna, ananta uan mere tece lyenna móronen ar tecilden.
But I have the hope that I will see you personally, and we will speak face to face. Peace be to you! The friends greet you. Greet the friends, each one by name.	Mal samin i estel i cenuvanyel vérave, ar quetuvangwe cendelello cendelenna. Raine na lyen! I meldor lye-suilar. Á suila i meldor, ilya quén essenen.
My first account, glorious Theophilus, I wrote about all the things that Jesus started to do and to teach,	Minya quentanya, alcarinqua Şeofílo, tencen pa ilye i nati yar Yésus yestane care ar peanta,
until the day when he was taken up, after he gave commands to the apostles that he chose.	tenna i aure yasse anes mapana ama, apa antanes canwali i apostelin i cildes.
To them he also showed himself alive with many signs after he suffered, being seen by them through forty days, making known the things that concern God's kingdom.	Tien yú tannes inse coirea rimbe tanwalínen apa perpéres, nála cénaina lo té ter auri canaquean, cárala sinwe i nati yar apir Eruo aranie.
And at his meetings with them he gave them the commands: “Do not go away from Jerusalem, but remain, waiting for that about which the Father gave his promise, and about which you heard from me.	Ar omentieryassen aselte antanes tien i canwar: “Áva lelya oa Yerúsalemello, mal á lemya, hopila tan pa ya i Atar antane vandarya, ar pa ya hlasselde nillo.
For John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with Holy Spirit not many days from now.”	An Yoháno sumbane nennen, mal elde nauvar sumbane Aire Feanen lá rimbe auri ho sí.”
Now when they were assembled, they asked him: “Lord, do you renew the kingdom for Israel at this time?”	Sí íre anelte ocómienwe, maquentelte senna: “Heru, ma envinyatal i aranie Israélen lúme sinasse?”
He said to them: “It is not for you to know the times and moments which the Father has placed in his own power,	Quentes téna: “Ua len ista i lúmi ar lúr yar i Atar apánie véra túreryasse,
but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit shall come to you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and the entire Judea and Samaria alike, and to the farthest part of the earth.”	mal camuvalde túre íre i Aire Fea tuluva lenna; ar nauvalde astarmonyar mi Yerúsalem ar i quanda Yúrea ar Samária véla, ar cemeno anhaira rantanna.”
And after he said these things, while they were watching, he was being lifted up, and a cloud hid him from their eyes .	Ar apa quentes nati sine, lan tíranelte, anes ortaina, ar lumbo se-nurtane hendultalto.
And while they looked up into heaven when he went away, behold! two men in white garments stood by them,	Ar íre yentelte ama mir menel íre oantes, yé! nér atta mi ninqui larmali tarnet ara te,
and they said: “Men from Galilee, how is that you are standing looking at heaven? This Jesus, who was taken up from you into the cloud, shall return so, in the same manner that you watched him go into heaven.”	ar quentette: “Neri Alileallo, manen ná i táralde yétala menel? Yésus sina, ye náne cámina ama lello mir i lumbo, entuluva sie, mí imya lé ya tirneldes lelyea mir menel.”
Then they went back into Jerusalem from the mountain called Mount of Olives, which is near to Jerusalem, around a sabbath's journey away.	Tá nanwennelte mir Yerúsalem i orontello estaina Oron Milloaldaron, ya hare ná Yerúsalemenna, os sendarelenda oa.
Then, after going inside, they went up into the upper hall where they dwelt, Peter and John and Jacob and Andrew, Philip and Thomas and Matthew, Jacob son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zelot, and Judas son of Jacob.	Tá, apa menie minna, lendelte ama mir i oromar yasse marnelte, Péter ar Yoháno ar Yácov ar Andréo, Filip ar Şomas ar Mattéo, Yácov Alféoion ar Símon i Sélot, ar Yúras Yácovion.
All among them were steadfast in prayer, with some women and Mary mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.	Illi mici te náner voronde hyamiesse, as nisseli ar María amil Yésuo, ar as hánoryar.
Now in those days Peter arose out of the middle of the brothers – the crowd was around hundred and twenty persons – and said:	Sí yane auressen Péter oronte et endello i hánoron – i şánga náne os queni yúquean tuxa – ar quente:
“Men, brothers, it was necessary for the Scripture to be made true, that which the Holy Spirit spoke beforehand through David's mouth about Judas, who showed the way for those that seized Jesus.	“Neri, hánor, mauyane i Tehtelen náve carna nanwa, ta ya i Aire Fea quente nóvo ter Laviro anto pa Yúras, ye tanne i tie in namper Yésus.
For he was counted among us and received a part in this ministry.”	An anes nótina mici vi ar camne ranta núromolie sinasse.”
(This man got a field for the reward of unrighteousness, and falling with a headlong movement he burst in the middle, and all his entrails poured out of him.	(Nér sina ñente resta i paityalénen úfailiéno, ar lantala hatsenen rúves i endesse, ar ilye hirdiryar uller et sello.
That became known to all that dwelt in Jerusalem, and therefore that field was called in their tongue Aceldama, which means: Field of Blood.)	Ta olle sinwa illin i marner Yerúsalemesse, ar etta sana resta náne estaina lambeltasse Aceldama, ya tea: Resta Serceva.)
“For has been written in the Book of Psalms: 'May his home be empty, and may no one live there', and: 'His place of oversight let another take.'	“An anaie técina i Parmasse Airelírion: 'Nai mardarya nauva lusta, ar nai úquen maruva tasse', ar: 'Nómerya ortíriéno lava exen mapa.'
Therefore it is necessary for us to choose one of the men that came together with us through the entire time in which the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,	Etta mauya ven cile er i nerion i túler uo aselve ter i quanda lúme yasse i Heru Yésus lende minna ar ettenna mici vi,
from the beginning when John was baptizing and until the day when he was received up from us. For a person among them it is necessary to be a witness with us about his resurrection.”	i yestallo íre Yoháno sumbeáne ar tenna i aure yasse anes cámina ama vello. Quenen mici té mauya náve astarmo aselve pa enortierya.”
And they led forward two, Joseph called Barsabbas, who had the nickname Justus, and Matthias.	Ar tulyanelte ompa atta, Yósef estaina Varsappas, ye sáme i epesse Yusto, ar Mattías.
And they prayed and said: “You, Lord who know the hearts of all, make known who you have chosen	Ar hyamnelte ar quenter: “Elye, Héru ye ista illion endar, cara sinwa man icíliel
to receive the ministry and place as apostle which Judas abandoned to go to his own place.”	camien i núromolie ar nóme ve apostel yar Yúras hehtane menien véra nómeryanna.”
And they threw lots about them, and the lot indicated Matthias, and he was counted among the eleven apostles.	Ar hantelte şanwali pa tu, ar i şanwa tenge Mattías, ar anes nótina imíca i minque aposteli.
When the day of the festival of Seven Weeks was come, they were all together in one place,	Íre i aure aşaro Otsolaron Otso náne tulinwa, anelte illi uo mi er nóme,
and suddenly came from heaven a noice as of a blowing violent wind, and they filled the entire house in which they were.	ar rincanen túle menello ran ve hlápula naraca súrio, ar quantes i quanda coa yasse engelte.
And tongues as of fire being distributed appeared to them, and it settled on everyone among them.	Ar lambali ve etsátaina náreva nemner tien, ar hamunes ilquende mici te.
Then all among them were filled with Holy Spirit and began to speak in various tongues, as the Spirit gave to them to talk.	Tá illi mici te náner quátine Aire Feanen ar yestaner quete alavéle lambelissen, ve i Faire antane tien carpa.
And were in Jerusalem Jews dwelling there, pious men, from every country under heaven.	Ar enger Yerúsalemesse Yúrali márala tasse, ainocimye neri, ilya nórello nu menel.
Thus, when this noise occurred, the host assembled and was confused, for everyone aming them heard them speak in his own tongue.	Sie, íre ran sina martane, i liyúme ocomne ar náne rucina, an ilquen mici te hlasse te quéta véra lamberyasse.
They were startled and in wonder, saying: “Behold, all these people that are speaking are from Galilee, no?	Anelte captaine ar mi elmenda, quétala: “Yé, ilye queni sine i quétar nar Alileallo, lá?
And yet how is that we are hearing, everyone among us, his own tongue that we are born in?	Ananta manen ná i hláralve, ilquen mici vi, véra lamberya yassen anelve nóne?
People from Parthea ar Media and Elam, people that dwell in Mesopotamia, Judea and Capadocia, Pontus and Asia,	Queni ho Parşea ar Meria ar Elam, queni i marir mi Mesopotamia, Yúrea ar Capaprocia, Pontus ar Ásia,
and Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the regions of Libya, near to Cyrene, and that have come from Rome, Jews and converted ones alike,	ar Frihia ar Pamfylia, Mirrandor ar i ménar Livio, hare Cirénenna, ar i utúlier Rómallo, Yúrar ar quérinar véla,
people from Crete and Arabia – we are hearing them speak in our own tongues about God's great deeds!”	queni ho Hréte ar Aravia – hláralvet quéta vére lambelvassen pa Eruo túre cardar!”
They were beside themselves with wonder and understood nothing, saying one to the other: “What is this thing?”	Anelte ara inte elmendanen ar hanyaner munta, quétala quén i exenna: “Mana ná nat sina?”
But others, in mockery against them, said: “They are full of sweet wine!”	Mal exeli, yaiwesse téna, quenter: “Nalte quante lisse limpeo!”
But Peter arose with the twelve and raised his voice and said to them: “Men from Judea and all you that dwell in Jerusalem, may this be known to you, and listen to my sayings:	Mal Péter oronte as i minque ar ortane ómarya ar quente téna: “Neri Yúreallo ar ilye elde i marir Yerúsalemesse, nai si nauva sinwa len, ar á lasta quetienyannar:
These men are not full of wine as you suppose, for this is the third hour of the day.	Queni sine é uar quante limpeo ve intyalde, an si i neldea lúme i aureo ná.
On the contrary, this is which was spoken though Joel the Prophet:	Úsie, si ná ya náne quétina ter Yoel i Erutercáno:
'And in the last days,' God says, 'I will pour of my spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters will speak like prophets, and your young men will see visions, and your old men will dream dreams will be dreamt with dreams],	'Ar i métime auressen,' Eru quete, 'ulyauvan fairenyo ilya hrávenna, ar yondoldar ar yeldeldar quetuvar ve Erutercánor, ar nesse nerildar cenuvar mauri, ar yáre nerildain óluva olollínen,
and also upon my male and female thralls I shall pour of my spirit in those days, and they will speak as prophets.	ar yú hanwe ar inye mólinyannar ulyauvan fairenyo ente auressen, ar quetuvalte ve Erutercánor.
And I will give signs in heaven above you and portents on earth below, blood and fire and mist of smoke;	Ar antauvan tanwali menelde or le ar tannali cemende nún, serce ar náre ar híşie usqueva;
The Sun will become darkness and the Moon will become blood, before the Lord's great and mighty day shall come.	Anar oluva mornie ar Işil oluva serce, nó i Héruo túra ar meletya aure tuluva.
And everyone who calls upon the Lord's name will be saved.	Ar ilquen ye yale i Héruo essenen nauva rehtana.'
Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus from Nazareth, a man that God put before you with mighty deeds and signs and portents which God did by him in your midst, as you know,	Neri Israélo, hlara quettar sine: Yésus Násaretello, nér ye Eru panyane epe le taure cardalínen ar tanwalínen ar tannalínen yar Eru carne sénen endeldasse, ve elde istar,
this man, as a person given over, by God's firm plan and the knowledge that he had beforehand, you fastened on a cross by the hand of lawless ones and killed him.	nér sina, ve quén antana olla, Eruo tanca panonen ar i istyanen ya sámes nóvo, tancelde tarwesse úşanyaron mánen ar nacanter se.
But God raised him by loosening the bonds of death, for it was not possible for death to keep him.	Mal Eru ortane se lehtiénen qualmeo núti, an úne cárima qualmen hepitas.
For David says concerning him: 'I always saw the Lord before my eyes, for he is by my right hand, to stop me from being shaken.	An Lavir quete pa sé: 'Illume cennen i Héru epe hendunyat, an náse ara formanya, ni-pustien návello pálina.
Therefore my heart was glad and my tongue spoke about great joy. Furthermore, also my flesh will dwell in hope,	Etta endanya náne valima ar lambanya quente pa túra alasse. Ente, yú hrávenya maruva estelde,
for you will not abandon my soul in Mandos , also you will not allow your faithful one to see a corrupt state.	an ual hehtuva feanya Mandostosse; yú ual lavuva vorondalyan cene quelexima sóma.
You have made known to me the paths of life; you will fill me with joy from your face.'	Acáriel sinwe nin i tier coiviéva; ni-quantuval alassenen cendelelyallo.'
Men, brothers, it is me allowed to speak freely to you about the patriarch David, that he expired and was brought to his grave, and his tomb is among us until this day.	Neri, hánor, nin ná lávina quete lérave lenna pa i atartur Lavir, i effirnes ar náne talana sapsaryanna, ar noirirya ea mici vi tenna aure sina.
Therefore, since he was a prophet and knew that God gave him a promise about placing on his throne a person of the fruit of his loins,	Etta, pan anes Erutercáno ar sinte i Eru antane sen vanda pa panie mahalmaryasse quén yáveo oşweryo,
he had foresight and spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned in Mandos ; furthermore, his flesh did not see a corrupt state.	sámes apacen ar quente pa i enortave i Hristova, in únes hehtana Mandostosse; ente, hráverya ua cenne quelexima sóma.
This Jesus God resurrected, about which all among us are witnesses.	Yésus sina Eru enortane, pa ya illi mici me nar astarmor.
Therefore, since he was raised to God's right hand and received the Holy Spirit from his Father by the promise he had given, he poured forth this that you are seeing and you are hearing.	Etta, pan anes ortana Eruo formanna ar camne i Aire Fea Ataryallo i vandanen ya hé antanelyane, et-ulyanes si ya cénalde ar hláralde.
For David did not ascend to heaven, but he himself says: 'The Lord said to my lord: Sit by my right hand,	An Lavir ua oronte menelenna, mal isse immo quete: 'I Héru quente herunyanna: Hara ara formanya,
until I shall place your enemies as a support for your feet.'	tenna panyuvan ñottotyar ve tulco talutyant.'
Therefore may the entire kin of Israel know that God made him Lord and Christ, this Jesus that you crucified.”	Etta nai i quanda nosse Israélo istuva in Eru carne se Heru ar Hristo, Yésus sina ye tarwestanelde.”
When they heard that they were cut in their heart, and they said to Peter and to the other apostles: “Men, brothers, what are we to do?”	Íre hlasselte ta anelte círine endaltasse, ar quentelte Péterenna ar i hyane apostelinnar: “Neri, hánor, mana caruvalme?”
Peter said to them: “Find repentance, and may everyone among you be baptized by the name of Jesus Christ for forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of Holy Spirit.	Péter quente téna: “Hira inwis, ar nai ilquen mici le nauva sumbana Yésus Hristo essenen apsenien úcarildaiva, ar camuvalde i anna Aire Feava.
For for you is the promise, and for your children and for that are far away – all that the Lord our God will call to himself.”	An elden i vanda ná, ar hínaldain ar in nar haire – illi i yaluva i Heru Ainolva insenna.”
And with many other words he witnessed for them and urged them, saying: “Be saved from this perverse generation!”	Ar rimbe hyane quettalínen vettanes tien ar hortane te, quétala: “Á na rehtane quarca nónare sinallo!”
Therefore that received his word were baptized, and on that day around three thousand souls were added.	Etta i camner quettarya náner sumbane, ar yana auresse os fear húmi nelde náner napánine.
And they were steadfast in the teaching of the apostles and the brotherhood, in the breaking of the bread and in the prayers.	Ar anelte voronde mí peantie i apostolion ar mí otornasse, i raciesse i massava ar i hyamiessen.
Fear fell upon everyone, and numerous wonders and signs happened through the apostles.	Rucie lantane ilquenna, ar rimbe elmendali ar tanwali martaner ter i aposteli.
All that believed were together in having everything common,	Illi i sáver náner uo samiesse ilqua alasatya,
and they sold their goods and the fields that they possessed and distributed the money to all, by anyone's need.	ar vancelte armaltar ar i restar yar haryanelte ar etsanter i telpe illin, aiqueno maurenen.
And day after day they were in the temple, being of one mind, and they broke bread in the houses, eating their food in joy and having a pure heart,	Ar aure apa aure anelte i cordasse, nála er sámo, ar rancelte massa i coassen, matila mattalta mi alasse ar arwe poica endo,
praising God and having the grace of the entire people, while every day the Lord was adding to them that were saved.	laitala Eru ar arwe i lisseo i quanda lieo, lan ilya auresse i Heru napánane tien i náner rehtane.
Now Peter and John went up into the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour.	Sí Peter ar Yoháno lender ama mir i corda i lúmesse hyamiéno, i nertea lúme.
And a man who was lame from his mother's womb was being carried thither, and they put him every day beside the gate of the temple that was called the Beautiful, for him to ask gifts of mercy from those that were going into the temple.	Ar nér ye náne úlévima amilleryo súmallo náne cólaina tar, ar panyaneltes ilya auresse ara i ando i cordo ya náne estaina i Mairea, arcieryan annar oraviéva ho i ménaner mir i corda.
When he saw Peter and John going towards the temple, he asked from them gifts of mercy.	Íre cennes Péter ar Yoháno lelyea i cordanna, arcanes tullo annar oraviéva.
But Peter, with John, looked at him and said: “Look at us!”	Mal Péter, as Yoháno, yente senna ar quente: “Ámet yéta!”
Therefore he fixed his eyes on them, thinking that he was going to receive something from them.	Etta tances henyat tusse, sánala i camumnes nat tullo.
But Peter said: “Silver and gold I do not possess, but what I do have I give to you: By the name of Jesus Christ from Nazareth, walk!”	Mal Péter quente: “Telpe ar malta uan harya, mal ya é samin antan lyen: Essenen Yésus Hristo Nasaretello, á vanta!”
And he seized him in his right hand and raised him up. In the same moment his soles and the joints between foot and leg became firm,	Ar nampeses formaryasse ar ortane se. Mí imya lú talluniryat ar i oxor imbi tál ar telco oller tulce,
and he jumped up and walked, and he went with them into the temple, walking and jumping and praising God.	ar campes ama ar vantane, ar lendes asette mir i corda, vantala ar cápala ar laitala Eru.
And the entire people saw him walking and praising God.	Ar i quanda lie cenne se vantea ar laitea Eru.
Furthermore, they knew who he was, that he was the man who beforehand sat to receive gifts of mercy by the Fair Gate in the temple, and they were filled with wonder and were beside themselves by which had happened to him.	Ente, sintelte man anes, in isse náne i nér ye nóvo hamne camien annar oraviéva ara i Mairea Ando i cordasse, ar anelte quátine elmendanen ar náner ara inte yanen martanelyane sen.
When the man stuck to Peter and John, the entire people, being startled, ran together to them in the place called the Columnade of Solomon.	Íre i nér himyane Péter ar Yoháno, i quanda lie, nála captaine, norner uo téna i nómesse estaina i Tarmatéma Solomondo.
Seeing that, Peter said to the people: “Men of Israel, how is that you are in wonder about this, and what is your reason for looking at us as if by our own power or by our godliness we have caused him to walk?	Cénala ta, Péter quente i lienna: “Neri Israélo, manen ná i nalde elmendasse pa si, ar mana castalda yétien met ve qui véra melehtemmanen hya ainocimiemmanen atyáriemmes vanta?
The God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has made Jesus his servant glorious, him that you gave over and denied before the face of Pilate, though he wanted to free him.	I Aino Avrahámo ar Ísaco ar Yácovo, atarelvaron Aino, acárie Yésus núrorya alcarinqua, sé ye elde antaner olla ar laquente epe Piláto cendele, ómu hé merne lerya se.
You denied the holy and just , and you requested that you were to receive a man who was a murderer,	Elde laquenter i aire ar faila, ar arcanelde i camumnelde nér ye náne nahtar,
but you killed the Chief of life. But God raised him from dead, of which all among us are witnesses.	mal nacantelde i Turco coiviéva. Mal Eru ortane se qualinallon, pa ya illi mici me nar astarmor.
Therefore, by our faith in his name, his name has made this man strong, him whom you look at and whom you know, and the faith which is through him has given him health before your eyes.	Etta, saviemmanen esseryasse, esserya acárie nér sina polda, sé ye yétalde ar ye istalde, ar i savie ya ea ter se ánie sen mále epe henduldat.
And now, brothers, I know that you did so in lack of knowledge, as your rulers also did.	Ar sí, hánor, istan i carnelde sie peniesse istyava, ve turcoldar yú carner.
But thus God has made true the things that beforehand he made known through the mouth of all his heralds : that his Christ was going to suffer.	Mal sie Eru acárie nanwe i nati yar nóvo carnes sinwe ter ilye tercánoryaron anto: i Hristorya perperumne.
Therefore find repentence and turn yourselves ! Then your sins will be wiped away, allowing times of refreshment to come from the face of the Lord.	Etta hira inwis ar quera inde! Tá úcareldar nauvar aupsárine, lavila lúmin ceutiéva tule i Héruo cendelello.
Thus he will send the Christ appointed to you, Jesus,	Sie mentauvas i Hristo sátina len, Yésus,
whom it is necessary for heaven to keep until the times of renewal of all things, of which God spoke by the mouth of his holy heralds , of old.	ye mauya menelen hepe tenna i lúmi envinyatáveva ilye nativa, pa yar Eru quente antonen airi tercánoryaron, yalúmesse.
Indeed Moses said: “The Lord your God will raise among your brothers, like me.	É Móses quente: “I Héru Ainolda ortauva Erutercáno mici hánoldar, ve ní.
Indeed every person who does to listen to that prophet will be destroyed from his people.”	É ilya quen ye ua lasta sana Erutercáno nauva nancarna lieryallo.”
And all the prophets, from Samuel to those that followed him – all that have spoken – have also made known these days.	Ar ilye i Erutercánor, ho Samuel innar hilyaner se – illi i equétier – yú acárier sinwe auri sine.
You are sons of the prophets and of the covenant that God established with your fathers, saying to Abraham: 'And in your seed all the families of earth will be blessed.'	Elde nar yondor i Erutercánoron ar i véreo ya Eru tulcane as atarildar, quétala Avrahamenna: 'Ar erdelyasse ilye i nossi cemeno nauvar aistane.'
After God raised his Son, to you he first sent him to bless you, by turning everyone away from your wicked deeds.”	Apa Eru ortane Yondorya, eldenna minyave se-mentanes aistien le, queriénen ilquen oa olce cardaldallon.”
While they talked to the people, the chief priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came to them,	Íre carampette i lienna, i hére airimor ar i cordo hesto ar i Sanducear túler túna,
being angry since they instructed the people and made know the resurrection from the dead by Jesus.	nála rúşie pan peantette i lien ar carnet sinwe i enortale qualinallon Yésunen.
And they put their hands on them and put them in gaol until the following day, for evening had come.	Ar panyanelte máltat tusse ar panyaner tu mandosse tenna i hilyala aure, an şinye náne tulinwa.
But numerous ones among that heard the word believed. And the number of the men rose as far as five thousands.	Mal rimbali imíca i hlasser i quetta sáver. Ar i nóte i nerion oronte tenna húmi lempe.
It happened on the following day that the rulers and the elders and the scribes in Jerusalem assembled,	Túle i hilyala auresse i ocomner i turi ar i amyárar ar i parmangolmor Yerúsalemesse,
with Annas the chief priest and Caiaphas and John and Alexander and all that were of the kin of the chief priest.	as Annas i héra airimo ar Caiafas ar Yoháno ar Alexander ar illi i náner i nosseo i héra airimo.
After putting them in their midst they asked: “By what power and by whose name did you do this thing?”	Apa panie tu endaltasse maquentelte: “Mana túrenen hya mano essenen carneste nat sina?”
Then Peter, full of Holy Spirit, said to them: “Rulers of the people and elders,	Tá Péter, quanta Aire Feo, quente téna: “Turcor i lieo ar amyárar,
if we are on this day investigated about a good deed to an ailing man, and you want to know by whom this man has received his health,	qui namme aure sinasse céşaine pa mára carda nimpa neren, ar merilde ista mannen nér sina acámie málerya,
may it be known to all among you and to the entire people of Israel that it happened by the name of Jesus Christ from Nazareth, whom you crucified but God raised out of dead. By him this man is standing here before you in health.	nai nauva sinwa illin mici le ar i quanda lien Israélo i sá martane i essenen Yésus Hristo Nasaretello, ye elde tarwestaner mal Eru ortane et qualinaillon. Issenen nér sina tára sisse epe le málesse.
This is the rock which was counted as nothing by you that built, which has been made the head of the corner.	Si ná i ondo ya náne nótina ve munta lo elde i carastaner, ya olólie i vinco cas.
For is no salvation by anyone else, for also there is not given other name by which it is necessary for us to be saved.”	Ar rehtie ua ea aiquen hyananen, an yú ua antana hyana esse nu menel yanen mauya ven náve rehtane.”
When they saw how freely Peter and John spoke, and knew that they were unlettered and ordinary men, they were filled with wonder, since they also knew them as people that were with Jesus.	Íre cennelte manen lérave Péter ar Yoháno quenter, ar sinter i anette tengwalóre ar senwe neri, anelte quátine elmendanen, pan yú sinteltet ve queni i náner as Yésus.
When they saw the man that stood with them , he who received health, they had nothing to say against them .	Íre cennelte i nér ye tarne asette, sé ye camne mále, sámelte munta quetien ana tu.
Therefore, after commanding them to go out from the council, they made a consideration together,	Etta, apa canie tun lelya et i ocombello, carnelte úvie uo,
saying: “What are we to do to these men? For a sign which people know has happened through them, easy to see to all that dwell in Jerusalem, and it is not possible for us to deny it.	quétala: “Mana caruvalve sine nerin? An tanwa ya queni istar amartie ter tu, aşcénima illin i marir Yerúsalemesse, ar ua ece ven laquete sa.
But to stop it from being spread more widely in the people, let us rebuke them , that they are not to speak more by this name to anyone.”	Mal pustien sa návello vintana ambe palan i liesse, alve naitya tu, in ávatte quetuva ambe esse sinanen aiquenna.”
And after calling them they commanded them that it was necessary for them to completely cease to speak and teach by the name of Jesus.	Ar apa yalie tu cannelte tun i mauyane tun aqua pusta quete ar peanta Yésuo essenen.
But in answer Peter said to them: “If it is just in God's eyes to listen to you and not to God, you judge for yourselves!	Mal hanquentasse Péter quente téna: “Qui faila ná Eruo hendusse lasta lenna ar lá Erunna, alde name inden!
But we cannot cease to speak about that we have seen and we have heard.”	Mal emme uat pole pusta quete pa yar ecéniemme ar ahláriemme.”
After they spoke more to them with sharp words they released them, since they did not find a reason for punishing them , and by reason of the people, for all among them gave glory to God about which had happened.	Apa ambe quentelte túna aice quettalínen lehtaneltet, pan ualte hirne casta paimetien tu, ar castanen i lieo, an illi mici te antaner alcar Erun pa ya martanelyane.
For the man on which this sign of healing had happened had more than forty years.	An i nér yesse tanwa sina nestiéva náne martienwa sáme amba lá loar canaquean.
And after they were released they went to their own and told them about the things which the chief priests and elders had said to them .	Apa anette lehtane lendette vérattannar ar nyarner tien i nati yar i hére airimor ar i amyárar quentelyaner túna.
Hearing that, with one mind they raised their voice to God and said: “Master, you are who made heaven and earth and that are exist in them ,	Hlárala ta, er sámanen ortanelte ómalta Erunna ar quenter: “Hér, elye ná ye carne menel cemenye ar yar ear tusse,
and who by Holy Spirit spoke through the mouth of David our father, your servant: 'How is that nations rise up up and peoples are thinking about empty things?	ar ye Aire Feanen quente ter i anto Lavir atarelmo, núrolya: 'Manen ná i nóreli amortar ar lieli sánear pa luste natali?
The kings of earth have taken stand and the rulers have assembled as one, against the Lord and against his Christ.'	Cemeno arani atárier ar i cánor ócómier ve er, i Hérunna ar Hristoryanna.'
For indeed they assembled in this city, Herod and Pontius Pilate and people of the nations against your holy servant, Jesus, whom you anointed,	An é ocomnelte osto sinasse, Herol ar Pontio Piláto ar ennoli i nórion aire núrolyanna, Yésus, ye lível,
to do that by your hand and by your choice you have beforehand established were going to happen.	carien yar mályanen ar cilmelyanen nóvo utulciel martumner.
And now, Lord, notice their threats, and allow your servants to speak your word with all boldness,	Ar sí, Héru, á tunta lurweltar, ar lava mólilyain quete quettalya ilya veriénen,
when you reach out with your hand to heal, and when signs and portents happen by the name of your holy servant, Jesus.	íre rahtal mályanen nestien, ar íre tanwali ar tannali martar essenen aire núrolyo, Yésus.
And after they said the request, the place where they were assembled was being shaken, and everyone among them was filled by the Holy Spirit and spoke God's word with boldness.	Ar apa quentelte i arcande, i nóme yasse anelte ócómienwe náne pálaina, ar ilquen mici te náne quátina i Aire Feanen ar quente Eruo quetta veriénen.
Furthermore, the multitude of those that believed had one mind and spirit, and no one among them said about anything that he had that that was his own, but they possessed all things in common .	Ente, i liyúme ion sáver sámer er enda ar fea, ar úquen mici te quente pa aiqua ya sámes i ta náne vérarya, mal haryanelte ilye nati uo.
And with great power the apostles gave out their witness about the resurrection of Jesus Christ, and great grace lay upon all among them.	Ar túra túrenen i aposteli et-antaner vettielta pa i enortave Yésus Hristova, ar túra Erulisse caine illinnar mici te.
Indeed was no one having need among them, for all that had fields or houses sold them and brought the money that they got for the sold things	É enge úquen arwa maureo mici te, an illi i sámer restar hya coar vancer tai ar talle i telpe ya ñentelte i vácine natin
and put that before the feet of the apostles. Then one distributed to everyone was their need was.	ar panyaner ta epe i apostelion talu. Tá mo etsate ilquenen ve maurelta náne.
Thus Joseph, who from the apostles received the nickname Barsabba – which means Son of Comfort – one of the Levites, born at Cyprus,	Sie Yósef, ye i apostellon camne i epesse Varsappa – ya tea Tiutaleo Yondo – quén i Leviron, nóna Ciprusse,
who had a field, sold it and brought the money and put it before the feet of the apostles.	ye sáme resta, vance sa ar talle i telpe ar panyane sa epe i apostelion talu.
But a man whose name was Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a field that he had	Mal nér yeo esse náne Ananías, as Saffíra verirya, vance resta ya sámes
and secretly kept a part of the money that he got, as his wife also knew. He brought only a part and put it before the feet of the apostles.	ar nuldave hempe ranta i telpeo ya ñentes, ve yú verirya sinte. Talles eryave ranta ar panyane sa epe i apostolion talu.
But Peter said: “Ananias, how is that Satan has given you boldness to lie to the Holy Spirit and put away for yourself a part of the money that you got for the field?	Mal Péter quente: “Ananías, manen ná i Sátan ánie lyen verie hurien i Aire Fean ar panya oa elyen ranta i telpeo ya ñentel i restan?
While you possessed it, was it not your own? And after it was sold, could you not still choose what you were going to do? What is your reason for doing such a deed? You have lied, not to men, but to God!”	Lan haryanelyes, ma únes véralya? Ar apa anes vácina, ma ual en lertane cile mana carumnel? Mana castalya carien taite carda? Uhúriel, lá atanin, mal Erun!”
When he heard these words, Ananias fell down and expired. And a great fear came upon all that heard it.	Íre hlasses quettar sine, Ananías lantane undu ar effirne. Ar túra rucie túle illinnar i hlasser sa.
But the young men rose up, wrapped him in clothes, and carried him outside to his grave.	Mal i nesse neri oronter, se-vaitaner lannelissen, ar coller se ettenna sapsaryanna.
After three hours his wife came inside, not knowing which had happened.	Apa lúmi nelde verirya túle minna, lá istala ya martanelyane.
Peter said to her: “Tell me, did you sell the field for this sum?” She said: “Yes, that was the sum.”	Péter quente senna: “Ánin nyare, ma vanceste i resta nonwe sinan?” Quentes: “Ná, ta náne i nonwe.”
But Peter said to her: “How is that you were of one mind to test the Lord's spirit? Behold! The feet of that brought your husband to his grave are before the door, and they will carry you outside.”	Mal Péter quente senna: “Manen ná i aneste er sámo tyastien i Héruo faire? Yé! I talu ion taller verulya sapsaryanna nát epe i fenda, ar coluvalte lyé ettenna.”
In the same moment she fell down before Peter's feet and expired. Whent he young men came inside, they found her dead, and they carried her outside and gave her a grave beside her husband.	Mí imya lú lantanes undu epe Pétero talu ar effirne. Íre i nesse neri túler minna, hirneltes qualina, ar colleltes ettenna ar antane sen sapsa ara verurya.
Therefore great fear came upon the entire congregation and upon all that heard about these things.	Etta túra rucie túle or i quanda ocombe ar or illi i hlasser pa nati sine.
Furthermore, through the hands of the apostles numerous signs and portents happened among the people, and all among them assembled in Solomon's columnade, being of one mind.	Ente, ter i apostolion mát rimbe tanwali ar tannali martaner imíca i lie, ar illi mici te ocomner Solomondo tarmatémasse, nála er sámo.
No one of the others dared to join himself to them, and yet the people praised them.	Úquen i exion veryane erta inse téna, ananta i lie laitane te.
Furthermore, persons that belived in the Lord were added, multitudes of men and women alike.	Ente, queneli i sáver i Herusse náner napánine, liyúmeli nelliva ar nisseliva véla.
Therefore they brought the sick ones outside and put them there on small beds and on biers, wishing only that Peter, when he passed by, was going to cast shadow on some people among them.	Etta tallelte i hlaiwar ettenna ar panyaner te tasse pitye caimalissen ar tulmalissen, mérala rie i Péter, íre lahtanes, hatumne leo quenelinnar mici te.
And the multitude from the cities surrounding Jerusalem assembled, carrying sick ones and that were being tormented by unclean spirits, and everyone among them was healed.	Ar i liyúme i ostollon pelila Yerúsalem ocomne, cólala hlaiwali ar i náner nwalyaine lo úpoice fairi, ar ilquen mici te náne nestana.
But the chief priest and that were with him, the order of the Sadducees that existed then, arose and were filled with envy,	Mal i héra airimo ar i enger óse, i heren Sanducearon ya enge tá, oronter ar náner quátine hrúcennen,
and they laid hands upon the apostles and put them in the city gaol.	ar panyanelte mát i apostelinnar ar panyaner te i ostomandosse.
But in the night the Lord's angel opened the gates of the gaol, brought them outside and said:	Mal i lómisse i Héruo vala pantane i mando andor, talle te ettenna ar quente:
“Go, and standing in the temple speak to the people all the sayings about this life!”	“Á lelya, ar tárala i cordasse á quete i lienna ilye i quetier pa coivie sina!”
After they heard that, they went at dawn into the temple and taught.	Apa hlasselte ta, lendelte árasse mir i corda ar peantaner.
When the chief priest and that were with him came, they assembled the High Council and the entire council of the sons of Israel, and they sent them to the gaol to bring them.	Íre i héra airimo ar i enger óse túler, comyanelte i Tára Combe ar i quanda ocombe amyáraron i yondoron Israélo, ar mentaneltet i mandonna talien te.
But when the officers came thither, they did not find them in the gaol. After returning they told:	Mal íre i cánor túler tar, ualte hirne te i mandosse. Apa nanwenie nyarnelte:
“The gaol we found shut with all security, and the guards standing by the doors, but when we opened the gaol we did not find anyone on the inside.”	“I mando hirnelme pahta ilya varnassenen, ar i cundor tárala ara i fendar, mal íre latyanelme i mando ualme hirne aiquen i mityasse.”
When the captain of the temple and the chief priest alike heard these words, they were uncertain about these things and about what was going to happen because of this matter.	Íre i cordo hesto ar i héra airimo véla hlasser quettar sine, anelte útance pa nati sine ar pa mana martumne sina nattonen.
But a man came and told them: “Behold! The men that you put in the gaol are in the temple, standing and instructing the people!”	Mal nér túle ar nyarne tien: “Yé! I neri i panyanelde i mandosse nar i cordasse, tárala ar peantala i lien!”
Then the captain went away with his officers and brought them, but without violence, since they feared to be stoned by the people.	Tá i hesto lende oa as cánoryar ar taller te, mal pen orme, pan runcelte návello sartaine lo i lie.
They brought them and put them before the High Council. And the chief priest said: “We gave you the command: Cease to teach in this name! And yet, behold! you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and you want to bring this man's blood upon us!”	Talleltet ar panyaner te epe i Tára Combe. Ar i héra airimo quente: “Antanelme len i canwa: Á pusta peanta esse sinasse! Ananta, yé! aquátielde Yerúsalem peantieldanen, ar merilde tala ner sino serce menna!”
In answer Peter and the other apostles said: “It is necessary for us to follow God's commands over those of men.	Hanquentasse Péter ar i hyane aposteli quenter: “Mauya men hilya Eruo canwar or tai atanion.
The God of your fathers raised Jesus, whom you killed by hanging him on a tree.	Atarelvaron Aino ortane Yésus, ye elde nacanter lingiénen se aldasse.
God raised him to his right hand as Chief and Saviour, in order to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins.	Eru ortane se formaryanna ve Turco ar Rehto, antaven inwis Israélen, ar apsenie úcariva.
And we are witnesses about these matters, as is the Holy Spirit, that God gave to that listen to his commands.”	Ar elme nar astarmoli pa nattor sine, ve ná i Aire Fea, ya Eru antane in lastar canwaryannar.”
When they heard that, they felt wounded and wished to kill them.	Íre hlasselte ta, fellelte harne ar merner nahta te.
But was a man who arose in the High Council, a Pharisee whose name was Gamaliel, a law-teacher dear to the entire people. He commanded: “Lead the men to the outside for a short time.”	Mal enge nér ye oronte i Tára Combesse, Farisa yeo esse náne Amaliel, şanyepeantar melda i quanda lien. Cannes: “Á tulya i neri i ettenna şinta lúmen.”
Then he said to them: “Men of Israel, give heed to yourselves concerning what you want to do to these men.	Tá quentes téna: “Neri Israélo, cima inde pa ya merilde care sine nerin.
For before these days Theudas arose, saying that he was important, and a number of men, around four hundred, went with him. But he was slain, and all that heeded his commands were scattered and undone.	An nó auri sine Şeuras oronte, quétala i anes valdea, ar nóte nelliva, os tuxar canta, lender óse. Mal anes nahtana, ar illi i cimner canwaryar náner vintane ar nancarne.
After him Judas from Galilee arose, in the days in which the people was counted, and he drew away some people after himself. And yet that man died, and all that heeded his commands were scattered.	Apa sé Yúras Alileallo oronte, mí rí yassen i lie náne nótina, ar tunces oa queneli apa inse. Ananta sana nér qualle, ar illi i cimner canwaryar náner vintane.
And as things stand now, I say to you: Let these men be and do not trouble them, for if this matter or things doing is from men, it will be undone,	Ar ve nati tarir sí, quetin lenna: Lava sine nerin náve ar áva tarasta te, an qui natto sina hya carie sina atanillon ná, nauvas nancarna,
but if it is from God, you will not be able to undo them. Watch yourselves, that you will not be found fighting against God!”	mal qui Erullo nás, ualde poluva nancare te. Tira inde, i ualde nauva hírine mahtala Erunna!”
Then they gave heed to what he said. After summoning the apostles they flayed them and commanded them: “Do not speak in the name of Jesus!” Then they allowed them to go.	Tá cimnelte ya quentes. Apa tultave i aposteli rípeltet ar canner tien: “Ava quete mi esse Yésuo!” Tá lávelte tien mene.
They, therefore, went away from the High Council in joy, since they were counted worthy to suffer mockery for the sake of the name.	Té, etta, oanter i Tára Combello mi alasse, pan anelte nótine valde perperien yaiwe i essen.
And every day, in the temple and in the houses, they did not cease to make known the gospel about Jesus Christ.	Ar ilya auresse, i cordasse ar i coassen, ualte pustane care sinwa i evandilyon pa Yésus Hristo.
But in those days, while the number of disciples rose, the Hellenists were grumbling against the Hebrews, since their widows were not heeded in the daily distribution.	Mal yane auressen, lan i nóte hildoron oronte, i Hellenyar náner nurrula i Heveryannar, pan verulóraltar úner címine i ilaurea etsatiesse.
Therefore the twelve summoned the multitude of the disciples to themselves and said: “It is not good for us to abandon God's word to distribute food at the tables.	Etta i yunque yalder i hildoron liyúme intenna ar quenter: “Ua mára men hehta Eruo quetta etsatien matso i sarnossen.
Therefore, brothers, seek among yourselves seven men that have good witness, full of spirit and wisdom, and we will set them to cover this need,	Etta, hánor, á cesta mici inde neri otso i samir mára vettie, quante faireo ar sailiéno, ar panyuvalmet topien maure sina,
but we will still give yourselves to the praying and to the service of the Word.”	mal elme en antauvar imme i hyamien ar i núromolien i Quetto.”
And what they said was good to the entire multitude, and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of Holy Spirit, and Philip and Procorus and Nicanor and Timon and Parmenas and Nicolaus, a proselyte from Antioch,	Ar ya quentelte náne mára i quanda liyúmen, ar cildelte Stefáno, nér quanta saviéno ar Aire Feo, ar Filip ar Procoro ar Nicanor ar Timon ar Parmenas ar Nicolao, quernamo Antiocello,
and they put them before the apostles, and after praying they placed their hands on them.	ar panyaneltet epe i aposteli, ar apa hyamie panyanelte máltat tesse.
And God's word grew, and the number of the disciples rose quickly in Jerusalem, and a huge crowd of priests subjected themseves the faith.	Ar Eruo quetta alle, ar i hildoron nóte oronte lintave Yerúsalemesse, ar hoa şanga airomolíva panyaner inte nu i savie.
But Stephen, full of grace and of power, made mighty signs and portents among the people.	Mal Stefáno, quanta Erulisseo ar túreo, carne taure tanwali ar tannali imíca i lie.
But arose some men from the synagogue called of Freed Ones, and some people that came from Cyrene and Alexandria, to quarrel with Stephen.	Mal oronter nelli i yomencoallo estaina Leryainaiva, ar ennoli i túler Cireneallo ar Alexandriallo, costien as Stefáno.
But they could not stand against the wisdom and the spirit with which he talked.	Mal ualte polde tare i sailienna ar i fairenna yainen carampes.
Then secretly they made some men say: “We have heard him speak blasphemies against Moses and God.”	Tá nuldave carnelte nelli quete: “Ahlárielmes quéta naiquetiéli ana Móses ar Eru.”
And they stirred up the people and the elders and the scribes, and they fell upon him and seized him, and they brought him into the High Council.	Ar valtanelte i lie ar i amyárar ar i parmangolmor, ar lantanelte senna ar namper se, ar tulyaneltes mir i Tára Combe.
And they called lying witnesses, that said: “This man does not cease to speak words against this holy place and against the Law.	Ar yaldelte húrala astarmoli, i quenter: “Nér sina ua pusta quete quettar ana aire nóme sina ar ana i Şanye.
And we have heard him say that this Jesus from Nazareth will throw down this place and will change the customs that we have received from Moses.”	An ahlárielmes quéta i sina Yésus Nasaretello hatuva undu nóme sina ar vistauva i haimi yar acámielve Mósello.”
And when all that were sitting in the High Council looked at him, they saw that his face was like an angel's face.	Ar íre illi i hámaner i Tára Combesse yenter se, cennelte i cendelerya náne ve valo cendele.
But the chief priest said: “Are these matters so?”	Mal i héra airimo quente: “Ma nattor sine ear sie?”
He said: “Men, brothers and fathers, hear! The God of Glory showed himself to Abraham our father while he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran,	Eques: “Neri, hánor ar atari, hlara! I Aino Alcaro tanne inse Avraham atarinyan lan anes Mesopotamiasse, nó marnes mi Ħáran,
and he said to him: 'Go away from your land and from your kin and come to the place that I will show you.'	ar quentes senna: 'Á auta nórelyallo ar nosselyallo ar tula i nómenna ya tanuvan lyen.'
Then he went out from the land of the Chaldeans and dwelt in Haran. And from there, after his father died, God caused him to move to this land in which you now dwell.	Tá lendes et i nórello Caldeaiva ar marne mi Ħáran. Ar talo, apa atarya qualle, Eru tyarne se leve nóre sinanna yasse elde sí marir.
And yet he did not give him an heir's part in it, also not the earth under his foot-sole, but he gave him the promise that he was going to give it to him for him to possess it, and after him to his seed, while he still lacked child.	Ananta hé ua antane sen aryono ranta sasse, yando lá i cemen nu tallunirya, mal hé antane sen i vanda i sa-antauvanes sen harieryan sa, ar apa sé erderyan, lan en pennes hína.
Futhermore, this God said, that his seed was going to dwell like exiles in a foreign nation , and the people were going to make them thralls and were going to cause them affliction, through four hundred years.	Ente, sin quente Eru, in erderya marumne ve etyar ettelea nómesse, ar i lie carumner te móli ar tyarumner tien moia, ter loar tuxi canta.
And 'the country for which they will be thralls I shall judge,' said God, 'and thereafter they will go forth and will do service for me in this place.'	Ar 'i nóre yan nauvalte móli inye namuva,' quente Eru, 'ar epeta etelelyuvalte ar caruvar núromolie nin nóme sinasse.'
And he gave him a covenant of circumcision, and thus he begat Isaac and circumcized him on the eight day, and Isaac begat Jacob, and Jacob the twelve family heads .	Ar sen-antanes vére osciriéva, ar sie ónes Ísac ar oscirne se i toltea auresse, ar Ísac óne Yácov, ar Yácov i nossetúri yunque.
And the family heads, full of envy against Joseph, sold him into Egypt. But God was with him,	Ar i nossetúri, quante hrúceno Yósefenna, vancer se mir Mirrandor. Mal Eru enge óse,
and he delivered him out of all his tribulations and gave him grace and wisdom before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And he put him to rule Egypt and his entire house.	ar etelehtanes se et ilye şangieryallon ar antane sen lisse ar sailie epe Fáro aran Mirrandoro. Ar hé panyane se turien Mirrandor ar quanda coarya.
But famine came upon he entire land of Egypt and Canaan, indeed a great tribulation, and our fathers did not find food.	Mal saicele túle i quanda nórenna Mirrandoro ar Canáano, é túra şangie, ar atarilvar uar hirne matta.
But Jacob heard that was food in Egypt, and he sent our fathers the first time.	Mal Yácov hlasse i enge matta Mirrandoresse, ar mentanes atarilvar i minya lú.
And at the second time Joseph revealed himself to his brothers, and Jospeh's kin was made known to Pharaoh.	Ar mí attea lú Yósef apantane inse hánoryain, ar Yósefo nosse náne carna sinwa Fáran.
Sending a message, Joseph summoned Jacob his father and all his kin, seventy-five people.	Mentala menta, Yósef yalde Yácov atarya ar ilya nosserya, queni lempe otoquean.
Jacob went down into Egypt. And he expired, as did our fathers,	Yácov ununte mir Mirrandor. Ar effirnes, ve carner atarilvar,
and they were brought to Shechem and were put in the tomb that Abraham got from the sons of Hamor for a sum of silver .	ar anelte talane Hyecemenna ar aner panyane i noirisse ya Avraham ñente Ħamoro yondollon nonwen telpeo.
When the time came near for the promise which God made known to Abraham, the people grew and rose to a great number in Egypt,	Íre i lúme túle hare i vandan ya Eru carne sinwa Avrahámen, i lie alle ar oronte túra nótenna Mirrandoresse,
until another king arose over Egypt, who did not know Joseph.	tenna hyana aran oronte or Mirrandor, ye ua sinte Yósef.
He used cunning against our fathers and did evil do them, compelling them to put their babies out, for them to die.	Sé yuhtanefinie atarilvannar ar carne ulco tien, mauyala te panya lapseltar ettenna, qualieltan.
At that time Moses was born, and he was beautiful to God, and he was kept for three months in his father's house.	Lúme yanasse Móses náne nóna, ar anes vanima Erun, ar anes hépina ter astari nelde coasse ataryava.
But when he was put outside, Pharaoh's daughter took him and raised him as her own son.	Mal íre anes panyana ettenna, Fáro yelde nampe se ar ortane se ve véra yondorya.
And Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of Egypt, and he was mighty in his words and his deeds.	Ar Móses náne peantana mi ilya sailie Mirrandoro, ar anes taura mi quettaryar ar cardaryar.
When he had forty years, came into his heart that he would look to his brothers, the sons of Israel.	Íre sámes loar canaquean, túle mir endarya i yétumnes hánoryar, i Israelindi.
And when he saw a man who suffered injustice, he protected him and gave revenge to the one that suffered violence, by striking down the Egyptian.	Ar íre cennes nér ye perpére úfailie, se-varyanes ar antane ahtarie yen perpére orme, petiénen undu i Mirra.
He supposed that his brothers were going to understand that God would give them salvation by his hand, but they did not understand it.	Intyanes i hánoryar hanyumner in Eru antauva tien rehtie máryanen, mal ualte hanyane sa.
And on the following day he came to them while they fought, and he tried again to bring them together in peace, saying: 'Men, you are brothers! How is that you do injustice one to the other?'	Ar i hilyala auresse túles téna lan mahtanelte, ar néves ata tala te uo rainesse, quétala: 'Neri, nalde hánor! Manen ná i carilde úfailie quén i exenna?'
But who was injust to his neighbor pushed him away, saying: 'Who made you chief and judge over us ?	Mal ye náne úfaila armaroryan nirne se oa, quétala: 'Man carne lyé turco ar námo or met?
Perhaps you intend to kill me, like you killed the Egyptian yesterday?'	Cé telil nahta ni, ve nacantel i Mirra noa?'
Because of this word Moses ran away and dwelt in the land of Midian, where two sons were born to him.	Sina quettanen Móses norne oa ar marne Mirian·nóresse, yasse yondo atta nánet nóne sen.
And when forty years were gone, an angel showed himself to him in the wilderness by Mount Sinai, in the fiery flame of a thorn-bush.	Ar íre loar canaquean náner vanwe, vala tannexe sen i ravandasse ara Oron Sinai, i uruite náresse neceltusso.
When Moses saw it, what he saw filled him with wonder. But when he went near to examine , the Lord's voice came:	Íre Móses cenne sa, ya cennes quante se elmendanen. Mal íre lendes hare ce$ien, i Héruo óma túle:
'I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham and Isaak and Jacob.' Then trembling seized Moses, and he did not dare to examine further .	'Inye atarilyaron Aino, Avrahámo ar Ísaco ar Yácovo Aino.' Tá palie nampe Móses, ar uas veryane ce$e ambe.
The Lord said to him: 'Take your shoes from your feet, for the place on which you are standing is holy ground.	I Héru quente senna: 'Á mapa i hyapat talulyalto, an i nóme yasse táral aire talan ná.
I have indeed seen the evil done to my people in Egypt, and I have heard their moaning, and I have come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send you to Egypt.'	É ecécien i ulco carna lienyan Mirrandoresse, ar ahlárien ñónielta, ar utúlien undu etelehtien te. Ar sí tula, lye-mentauvan Mirrandorenna.'
This Moses that they turned away, saying: 'Who made you chief or judge?', this man God sent as chief and deliverer alike, by the hand of the angel that showed himself to him in the thornbush.	Móses sina ye quernelte oa, quétala: 'Man carne lyé turco ar námo?', sina nér Eru mentane ve turco ar etelehto véla, mánen i valo ye tanne inse sen mí neceltussa.
This man led them out after he did signs and portents in Egypt and in the Red Sea and in the wilderness for forty years.	Nér sina ettulyane te apa carnes tanwali ar tannali Mirrandoresse ar i Carne Earesse ar i ravandasse ter loar canaquean.
Thus Moses spoke to the Sons of Israel: 'God will raise for you out of your brothers a prophet like me.'	Sin quente Móses Israelindinnar: 'Eru ortauva len et hánoldallon Erutercáno ve ní.'
He is that was among the congregation in the wilderness with the angel that spoke to him on Mount Sinai and with your fathers, and he received living sayings to give to us.	Isse ná ye enge imíca i ocombe i ravandasse as i vala ye quente senna to Oron Sinai ar as atarilvar, ar camnes coirie quetier antaven ven.
To his commands our fathers refused to listen, but they pushed him away and turned themselves in their heart to Egypt,	Canwaryannar atarilvar váquenter lasta, mal nirneltes oa ar querner inte endaltasse Mirrandorenna,
saying to Aaron: 'Make for us gods that can go before us! For this Moses, who led us out of Egypt – we do not know what has happened to him.'	quétala Áronna: 'Cara men ainoli i polir mene epe me! An Móses sina, ye me-tulyane et Mirrandorello – ualme ista mana amartie sen.'
Therefore they made a calf in those days and brought a sacrifice to the idol, and they had joy by the work of their hands.	Etta carnelte mundolle yane auressen ar taller yanca i cordonen, ar sámelte alasse máltato tamannen.
But God turned himself and gave them over to serving the host of heaven, as has been written in the book of the prophets: 'Surely you did not give me gifts and sacrifices for forty years in the wilderness, House of Israel?	Mal Eru querne inse ar antane te olla vevien menelo hosse, ve anaie técina Erutercánoron parmasse: 'Lau inyen antanelde annar ar yancar ter loar canaquean i ravandasse, Nosse Israélo?
But you carried the tent of Moloch and the star of Rephan your god, the images that you made to worship them. Therefore I will take you away, beyond Babel .'	Mal coldelde i lancoa Moloqua ar i elen Réfan ainoldava, i emmar yar carnelde tyerien tai. Etta mapuvan le oa, Vável pella.'
Our fathers had the tent of witness in the wilderness, like who spoke to Moses commanded that one was to make it, according to the image that Moses saw.	Atarilvar sámer i lancoa vettiéva i ravandasse, ve ye quente Mósenna canne i mo carumne sa, ve i emma ya Móses cenne.
And our fathers that received it brought it with Joshua into the land being possessed by the peoples that God threw out before our fathers. There it remained until David's days.	Ar atarilvar i camner sa yú talle sa as Yosua mir i nóre haryaina lo i lier yar Eru et-hante epe atarilvar. Tasse sa lemne tenna Laviro auri.
He found grace before God and requested that he would give Jacob's God a place for dwelling.	Hirnes lisse epe Eru ar arcane in isse antauva Yácovo Ainon nóme marien.
But Solomon was that built him a house.	Mal Solomon náne ye carastane sen coa.
And yet the Highest does not dwell in houses made with hands, like the prophet says:	Ananta i Antara ua mare coassen cárine mainen, ve i Erutercáno quete:
'Heaven is my throne, and earth a support for my feet. What kind of house will you build for me, says the Lord, or what is my place for resting?	'Menel mahalmanya ná, ar cemen tulco talunyant. Mana nostaleo coa carastuvalde nin, quete i Héru, hya mana nómenya serien?
Or was not my hand what made all these things?'	Hya mánya úne ya carne ilye nati sine?'
O thrawn ones, uncircumcized in heart and ears, you always stand against the Holy Spirit; like your fathers, so also you!	A nornar, úoscírine mi enda ar hlaru, tarilde illume i Aire Feanna – tambe atarildar, síve yú elde!
Who among the prophets did your fathers not persecute? And they slew who beforehand made known the coming of the Just One, whom you have now given over and you have slain,	Man imíca i Erutercánor atarildar uar roitane? Ar nacantelte i nóvo carner sinwa tulesse i Failo, ye sí ánielde olla ar anahtielde,
you who received the Law as given through angels, but you have not kept it.	elde i camner i Şanye ve antana ter vali, mal ualde ehépie sa.”
When they heard these things they were cut in their heart, and they ground their teeth against him.	Íre hlasselde nati sine anelte círine endaltasse, ar múlelte nelciltar senna.
But he, full of Holy Spirit, looked into heaven and saw God's glory, and Jesus stand by God's right hand.	Mal isse, quanta Aire Feo, yente mir menel ar cenne Eruo alcar, ar Yésus tára ara Eruo forma.
And he said: “Behold, I see heaven opened, and the Son of Man stand by God's right hand.”	Ar eques: “Yé, cenin menel pantana ar i Atanyondo tára ara Eruo forma!”
But they cried with a mighty voice and stopped their ears, and they went rushing together upon him.	Mal yámelte taura ómanen ar tamper hlarultat, ar lendelte rimpe uo senna.
And after they threw him out of the city they threw stones at him. And the witnesses put away their clothes by a young man whose name was Saul.	Ar apa hanteltes et i ostollo hantelte sarneli senna. Ar i astarmor panyaner oa lanneltar ara nessa nér yeo esse náne Saul.
And they threw stones at Stephen while he was praying and saying: “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit!”	Ar hantelte sarneli Stefánonna lan hyamanes ar quétane: “Heru Yésus, cama fairenya!”
Then he fell upon his knees and cried with a loud voice: “Lord, do not count this sin against them!” And after saying that, he expired.	Tá lantanes occaryanta ar yáme taura ómanen: “Heru, áva note úcar sina ana te!” Ar apa quetie ta, effirnes.
Saul assented to the murder of him. On that day a great persecution arose against the congregation which was in Jerusalem; all except the apostles were scattered through the regions of Judea and Samaria.	Saul $áquente i nahtie séva. Yana auresse túra roitie oronte i ocombenna ya enge Yerúsalemesse; illi hequa i aposteli náner vintane ter i ménar Yúreo ar Samário.
But some men who feared God carried Stephen to his grave, and they made a great lamentation for him.	Mal nelli i runcer Erullo colder Stefáno sapsaryanna, ar carnelte túra nainie sen.
But Saul fell upon the congregation in an extremely harsh manner. Going into house after house and dragging outside men and women alike, he threw them into prison.	Ono Saul lantane i ocombenna mi ita naraca lé. Lelyala mir coa apa coa ar tucila ettenna neri ar nissi véla, hanteset mir mando.
But those that were scattered went through the land, making known the gospel about the Word.	Mal i náner vintane lender ter i nóre, cárala sinwa i evandilyon pa i Quetta.
Philip went down into the city of Samaria and made the Christ known to them.	Filip lende undu mir Samário osto ar carne i Hristo sinwa tien.
With one mind the crowds heeded the things being spoken by Philip while they listened and watched the signs that he did.	Er sámanen i şangar cimner i nati quétaine lo Filip lan lastanelte ar tirner i tanwar yar carnes.
And there were numerous ones that had unclean spirits , and they went out crying with a mighty voice. Furthermore, many that were lame and impeded were healed.	An enger rimbali i sámer úpoice fairi, ar té etelender yámala taura ómanen. Ente, rimbali i náner úlévime ar tapte náner nestane.
Therefore was much joy in that city.	Etta enge olya alasse osto tanasse.
But was in the city a man called Simon, who beforehand did magic and startled the nation of Samaria, saying about himself that he was a great person.	Mal enge i ostosse nér estaina Símon, ye nóvo carne ñúle ar cápe Samário nóre, quétala pa inse i anes túra quén.
And all among them, from the least to the greatest, gave heed to him and said: “This man is God's power, which is called Great.”	Ar illi mici te, i ampityallo i antúranna, cimner se ar quenter: “Nér sina Eruo túre ná, ya ná estaina Túra.”
Therefore they gave heed to him, since for a long time he had filled them with wonder with his magic.	Etta cimneltes, pan ter anda lúme quantelyanes te elmendanen ñúleryanen.
But when they believed the sayings of Philip, who made known God's kingdom and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, men and women alike.	Mal íre sávelte i quetier Filipo, ye carne sinwe Eruo aranie ar Yésus Hristo esse, anelte sumbane, neri ar nissi véla.
Also Simon believed, and after being baptized he remained with Philip and was being filled with wonder when he watched the sings and mighy deeds that happened.	Yú Símon sáve, ar apa náve sumbana lemnes as Filip ar náne quátaina elmendanen íre tirnes i tanwar ar taure cardar yar martaner.
When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received God's word, they sent Peter and John to them.	Íre i aposteli Yerúsalemesse hlasser i Samária camnelyane Eruo quetta, mentanelte Péter ar Yoháno téna.
They went down and prayed for them to receive Holy Spirit.	Lendette undu ar hyamnet camieltan Aire Fea.
For still it had not fallen upon them, but they were solely baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.	An en uas lantane téna, mal anelte rie sumbane mí esse i Heru Yésuo.
Then they put their hands on them , and they received Holy Spirit.	Tá panyanette máttat tesse, ar camnelte Aire Fea.
Now when Simon saw how the spirit was being given by putting hands , he put silver-pieces before them,	Sí íre Símon cenne manen i faire náne antaina paniénen mát, panyanes telpemittali epe te,
saying: “Give also to me this power, that anyone on whom I put my hands will receive Holy Spirit.”	quétala: “Á anta yú inyen túre sina, in aiquen yesse panyan mányat camuva Aire Fea.”
But Peter said to him: “May your silver and you be destroyed together, since you thought that you were going to possess God's gift for money!”	Mal Péter quente senna: “Nai telpelya ar elye nauvat nancarne uo, pan sannel i haryumnel Eruo anna telpen!”
You do not have a part or a portion in this matter, for your heart is not straight before God.	Ualye same ranta hya masse mi natto sina, an endalya ua téra epe Eru.
Therefore find repentance concerning this wickedness, and ask of the Lord that your heart's thought will be forgiven you,	Etta hira inwis pa olcie sina, ar á arca i Herullo in endalyo sanwe nauva apsénina lyen,
for I see that you are a poisonous gall and a bond of unrighteousness.”	an cenin i nalye hloirea sála ar naxa úfailiéva.”
In answer Simon said: “You make request of the Lord for me, to stop the things of which you spoke from coming upon me.”	Hanquentasse Símon quente: “Alde arca i Herullo nin, pustien i nati pa yar quentel tuliello ninna.”
Thus, after they gave a full witness and speaking the Lord's word, they returned to Jerusalem, and they made the gospel known in numerous villages of the Samareans.	Sie, apa antanelte quanta vettie ar quenter i Heruo quetta, nanwennelte Yerúsalemenna, ar carnelte i evandilyon sinwa rimbe mardolissen i Samáreaiva.
But the Lord's angel spoke to Philip, saying: “Rise and go southwards to the road that goes down from Jerusalem into Gaza.” That is in the wilderness.	Mal i Héruo vala quente Filipenna, quétala: “Á orta ar mena hyarmenna i mallenna ya mene undu Yerúsalemello mir Ása.” Ta i ravandasse ná.
And he arose and went, and behold! there came a minister from Ethiopia, a mighty man under Candace, queen of the people of Ethiopia. He had gone to Jerusalem to worship,	Ar orontes ar lende, ar yé! tasse túle arandur Etopiallo, taura nér nu Candáce, tári i lieo Etiopio. Lendelyanes Yérusalemenna tyerien,
but he returned and sat in his cart reading Isaiah the prophet.	mal nanwennes ar hamne norolleryasse hentala Isaia i Erutercáno.
And the Spirit said to Philip: “Go near to the cart and stick to it!”	Ar i Faire quente Filipenna: “Mena hare i norollenna ar ása himya!”
Philip ran beside it and heard him read Isaiah the prophet, and he said: “Do you truly understand what you are reading?”	Filip norne ara sa ar hlasse se hentea Isaia i Erutercáno, ar eques: “Ma nanwave hanyal mana henteal?”
He said: “How will it be possible for me to understand when I lack anyone who will show me what it means?” And he requested of Philip that he would come into the cart to sit with him.	Eques: “Manen ecuva nin hanya ire penin aiquen ye tanuva nin mana teas?” Ar arcanes Filipello i tulumnes mir i norolle hamien óse.
But the part of the scripture that he read was this: “Like a sheep he was being brought to the slaughter, and like a lamb that is voiceless before ho cuts off its wool, he did not open his mouth.	Mal i ranta i tehteleo ya hentanes náne si: “Ve máma anes talaina i nahtienna, ar ve eule ye ómalóra ná epe ye hocire tórya, uas pantane antorya.
In his humiliation the judgement was taken away from him. About his generation who will tell? For his life has been taken away from earth.”	Nucumieryasse i námie náne mapana oa sello. Pa nónarerya man nyaruva? An coivierya anaie mapana oa cemello.”
In answer the minister said: “I ask you, about whom does the prophet say this? About himself or about another person?”	Hanquentasse i arandur quente: “Maquetin lye, pa man i Erutercáno quete si? Pa inse hya pa hyana quén?”
Philip opened his mouth, and beginning from this scripture he made known to him the gospel about Jesus.	Filip pantane antorya, ar yestala tehtele sinallo carnes sinwa sen i evandilyon pa Yésus.
Now while they went on the road, they came to a place where was water, and the minister said: “Look, water! What stops me form being baptized?”	Sí íre lendette i mallesse, túlette nómenna yasse enge nén, ar i arandur quente: “Ela, nén! Mana pusta ni návello sumbana?”
Philip answered: “If you believe with all your heart, that can happen.”	Filip hanquente: “Qui savil quanda endalyanen, ta pole marta.”
And he commanded the cart to halt, and both went into the water, Philip and the minister together, and he baptized him.	Ar cannes i norollen hauta, ar yúyo lendet mir i nén, Filip ar i arandur uo, ar sumbanéses.
After they came up form the water, the Lord's spirit quickly led Philip away, and the miniser did not see him more, and he went on his road in joy.	Apa túlette ama i nenello, i Héruo faire lintave tulyane Filip oa, ar i arandur ua cenne se ambe, an hé lende malleryasse mi alasse.
But Philip was found in Asoto , and he went through the region and made the gospel known to all the cities until he reached Caesarea.	Mal Filip náne hírina Asotosse, ar lendes ter i ména ar carne i evandilyon sinwa ilye i ostoin tenna rahtanes Cesareanna.
But Paul, still breathing threat and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the chief priest and asked him for letters for the synagogues in Damascus, for him to bring bound to Jerusalem anyone that he found was of the Way, men and women alike.	Mal Saul, en şúyala lurwe ar nahtie i Heruo hildonnar, lende i héra airimonna ar arcane sello mentar i yomencoain Lamascusse, talieryan nútina Yerúsalemenna aiquen ye hirnes náne i Malleo, neri ar nissi véla.
On his journey, when was coming near to Damascus, suddenly shone around him a light from heaven,	Lendaryasse, íre túlanes hare ana Lamascus, rincanen caltane os se cala menello,
and after falling to the ground he heard a voice say to him: “Saul, Saul, what is your reason for persecuting me?”	ar apa lantie i talamenna hlasses óma quéta senna: “Saul, Saul, mana castalya roitien ni?”
He said: “Who are you, Lord?” He said: “I Jesus, whom you persecute!	Eques: “Man nalye, Heru?” Eques: “Inye Yésus, ye elye roita!
But rise and come into the city, and which is necessary for you to do will be told to you.”	Mal á orya ar tula mir i osto, ar ya mauya lyen care nauva nyárina lyen.”
The men that went with him stood dumb, for they heard the voice, but did not see anyone.	I neri i lender óse tarner úpe, an hlasselte i óma, mal uar cenne aiquen.
But Saul arose from the ground, and though his eyes were open he saw nothing. Therefore they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus.	Mal Saul oronte i talamello, ar ómu henyat nánet pante cennes munta. Etta tulyaneltes i mánen ar taller se mir Lamascus.
And for three days he saw nothing, and he did not eat or drink.	Ar ter rí nelde cennes munta, ar uas mante hya sunce.
 was in Damascus a disciple whose name was Ananias, and the Lord said to him in a vision: “Ananias!” He said: “Here I am, Lord.”	Enge Lamascusse hildo yeo esse náne Ananías, ar i Heru quente senna mi maur: “Ananías!” Eques: “Sisse ean, Heru.”
The Lord said to him: “Rise, go to the street called Straigth, and in the house of Judas seek a man called Saul, from Tarsus. For look! he is praying,	I Heru quente senna: “Á orya, mena i mallenna estaina Téra, ar mi coarya Yúras á cesta nér estaina Saul, ho Tarsus. An ye! hyámas,
and he has seen in a vision a man called Ananias come in and put his hands on him, for him to see again.”	ar ecénies mi maur nér estaina Ananías túla minna ar panyea máryat sesse, cenieryan ata.”
But Ananias answered: “Lord, I have heard from numerous ones about this man, about all the evil things that he did to your holy ones in Jerusalem.	Mal Ananías hanquente: “Heru, ahlárien rimbalillon pa nér sina, pa ilye i olce nati yar carnes airilyain Yerúsalemesse.
And here he has received power from the chief priests to bind all that call on your name.”	Ar sisse acámies túre i hére airimollon nutien illi i yalir esselyanen.”
But the Lord said to him: “Go, for this man is for me a chosen tool, to bear my name to the nations and to kings and to sons of Israel alike.	Mal i Heru quente senna: “Mena, an nér sina ná nin cílina tamma, colien essenya i nórennar ar arannar ar Israelindinnar véla.
For I will show him everything that it is necessary for him to suffer for my name.”	An inye tanuva sen ilqua ya mauyuva sen perpere essenyan.”
Then Ananias went, and he came into the house, and he put his hands on him and said: “Saul, brother – the Lord, the Jesus that showed himself to you on the road on which you came, has sent me for your to see again and for you to be filled with Holy Spirit.”	Tá Ananías lende, ar túles mir i coa, ar panyanes máryat sesse ar quente: “Saul, háno – i Heru, i Yésus ye tanne inse lyen i mallesse yasse túlel, ni-ementaye cenielyan ata ar návelyan quátina Aire Feo.”
And in the same moment fell from his eyes what seemed like shells, and he could again see, and he arose and was baptized.	Ar mi imya lú lantane henyalto ya nemne ve hyalmali, ar poldes ata cene, ar orontes ar náne sumbana.
Then he ate and was strengthened.For some days he remained with the disciples in Damascus,	Tá mantes ar náne turyana.Rélissen lemnes as i hildor Lamascusse,
and without waiting he made Jesus known in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God.	ar pen hopie carnes Yésus sinwa i yomencoassen, in isse i Eruion ná.
But all that heard him were filled with wonder and said: “Is this man not who in Jerusalem destroyed all that call on this name, and who came here for the purpose that he was going to lead them bound to the chief priests?	Mal illi i hlasser se náner quátine elmendanen ar quenter: “Ma nér sina ua ye Yerúsalemesse nancarne illi i yalir sina essenen, ar ye túle sir i ennen i tulyauvanes te nútine i hére airimonnar?”
But Saul was being strengthened, and he made the Jesus that dwelt in Damascus wholly confused by showing that Jesus is the Christ.	Mal Saul náne turyaina, ar carnes i Yúrar i marner Lamascusse aqua rúcine taniénen i Yésus ná i Hristo.
After a sufficient number of days the Jews made a consideration together, about how they were going to destroy him.	Apa fárea nóte rélion i Yúrar carner úvie uo, pa manen nancarumneltes.
But their plan against him became known to Paul. But they also watched the gates closely, day and night alike, to destroy him.	Mal panolta senna olle sinwa Saulen. Ono yú tirnelte i andor harive, auresse yo lómisse véla, nancarien se.
Therefore his disciples took him and sent him down by rope in a basket through a hole in the wall.	Etta hildoryar namper se ar mentaner se undu rappanen vircolcasse ter assa i rambasse.
When he came to Jerusalem he tried to join the disciples, but all feared him, since they did not believe that he was a disciple.	Íre túles Yerúsalemenna néves erta inse i hildoin, mal illi runcer sello, pan ualte sáve i anes hildo.
But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles, and he told them everything about how in on the road he saw the Lord, and that he spoke to him, and how in Damascus he spoke with boldness in Jesus' name.	Mal Varnavas nampe se ar talle se i apostelinnar, ar nyarnes tien ilqua pa manen i mallesse cennes i Heru, ar i hé quente senna, ar manen Lamascusse quentes veriénen mi Yésuo esse.
And he remained with them, going in and out in Jerusalem, speaking with boldness in the Lord's name,	Ar lemnes aselte, lelyala minna ar ettenna Yerúsalemesse, quetila veriénen mí Heruo esse,
talking and quarreling with the Jews that spoke Greek. But they made plans to destroy him.	carpala ar costala as i Yúrar i quenter Hellenya. Mal té carner panoli nancarien se.
When the brothers perceived that, they brought him to Caesarea and sent him away to Tarsus.	Íre i hánor túner ta, talleltes undu Césareanna ar mentaner se oa ana Tarsus.
Now the congregation in all of Judea and Galilee had peace and was being built up, and while they walked in fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, their number rose.	Sí i ocombe mi quanda Yúrea ar Alilea sáme raine ar náne carastaina ama, ar lan vantanelte ruciesse i Herullo ar mí Aire Feo tiutale, nótelta oronte.
Now when Peter went through all regions he came down also to the holy ones that dwelt in Lydda.	Sí íre Péter lende ter ilye ménar túles undu yú i airinnar i marner Lirdasse.
There he found a man called Aeneas, who had lain on his bier for eight years, since he was lame.	Tasse hirnes nér estaina Éneas, ye cainelyane tulmaryasse loassen tolto, pan anes úlévima.
And Peter said to him: “Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you. Rise and arrange your bed!” And he arose in the same moment.	Ar Péter quente senna: “Éneas, Yésus Hristo nesta lye. Á orya ar á parta caimalya!” Ar oronyes mí imya lú.
And all that dwelt in Lydda and Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord.	Ar illi i marner mi Lirda ar Hyaron cenner se, ar querneltexer i Herunna.
But in Joppa there was a female disiciple whose name was Tabitha, which means Dorcas . She was full of good deeds and gifts of mercy that she did.	Mal Yoppasse enge hilde yeo esse náne Tavişa, ya tea Lorcas. Anes quanta máre cardaron ar annaron oraviéva yar carnes.
But in those days she became ill and died. They washed her and put her in the upper room.	Mal ente auressen olles hlaiwa ar qualle. Sóveltes ar panyaner se i oromardesse.
Since Lydda was near to Joppa, when the disciples heard that Peter was in that city they sent two men to him to request of him: “Do not be late in coming to us!”	Pan Lirda náne hare Yoppanna, íre i hildor hlasser i Péter enge osto tanasse mentanelte nér atta senna arcien sello: “Áva na telwa tuliesse menna!”
They Peter arose and went with them. And when he came thither, they led him into the upper room, and all the widows stood with him in tears, showing him many tunics and cloaks that Dorcas had made when she was still with them.	Tá Péter oronte ar lende aselte. Ar íre túles tar, tulyaneltes mir i oromar, ar ilye i verulórar tarner óse nírelissen, tánala sen rimbe laupeli ar collali yar Lorcas carnelyane íre en enges aselte.
But Peter sent all outside, fell upon his knees and prayed. Then, after turning to the body, he said: “Tabitha, rise!” She opened her eyes, and seeing Peter she sat up.	Mal Péter mentane illi ettenna, lantane occaryanta ar hyamne. Tá, apa querie inse i hroanna, quentes: “Tavişa, á orya!” Hé pantane henyat, ar cénala Péter hé hamne ama.
Peter gave her his hand and raised her , and he called the holy ones and the widows and put her before them alive.	Péter antane hén márya ar ortane hé, ar yalles i airi ar i verulórar ar panyane hé epe te coirea.
This matter became known to all in Joppa, and numerous ones believed in the Lord.	Natto sina olle sinwa illin Yoppasse, ar rimbali sáver i Herusse.
For a sufficient number of days he remained in Joppa with a man called Simon, a leather-worker.	Fárea nótesse rélion lemnes Yoppasse as nér estaina Símon, alumo.
There was a man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of the army division called the Italian,	Enge nér Césareasse estaina Cornelio, tuxantur i hosseranto estaina i Itála,
who was reverent and feared God with his entire family, and he gave many gifts of mercy to the people and was praying to God always.	ye náne ainocimya ar runce Erullo as quanda nosserya, ar antanes rimbe annali oraviéva i lien ar hyámane Erunna illume.
Around the ninth hour he saw in a vision an angel of God come inside to him and saying to him: “Cornelius!”	Os i nertea lúme cennes mi maur Eru vala túla minna senna ar quéta senna: “Cornelio!”
The man looked at him, and being frightened he said: “What do you want, Lord?” He said to him: “Your prayers and your gifts of mercy have ascended like a reminder before God.	I nér yente se, ar nála ruhtaina quentes: “Mana meril, Heru?” Quentes senna: “Hyamielyar ar annalyar oraviéva orontier ve enyalie epe Eru.
And now, send some men to Joppa and call a person called Simon, who has the nickname Peter.	Ar sí, á menta nelli Yoppanna ar yala quén estaina Símon, ye same i epesse Péter.
This man dwells in house of a man whose name is Simon, a leather-worker, who has his house by the sea.”	Nér sina mare coasse quenwa yeo esse Símon ná, alumo, ye same coa ara i ear.”
After the angel who spoke to him went away, he called two of the servants of his house and a reverent soldier from among those that remained with him,	Apa i vala ye quente senna lende oa, yaldes atta i núroron coaryo ar ainocimya ohtar ho imíca i lemner óse,
and he told them everything and sent them to Joppa.	ar nyarnes ilqua tien ar te-mentane Yoppanna.
On the following day, when they were on their journey and were coming near to the city, Peter went up to the roof around the sixth hour, in order to pray.	I hilyala auresse, íre engelte lendaltasse ar túlaner hare i ostonna, Péter lende ama i tópanna os i enquea lúme, hyamien.
But he was hungry and wanted to eat. While they prepared, he went into a vision	Mal anes maita ar merne mate. Lan manwanelte, lendes mir maur
and saw heaven opened and some kind of vessel that came down like a huge sheet of linen,	ar cenne menel pantana ar nostaleo vene ya túle undu ve hoa talat páşeva,
and in it were all kinds of four-legged and creeping things and birds of heaven.	ar sasse enger ilye nostaleron cantalyar ar hlicilar ar aiwi menelo.
And a voice came to him: “Rise, Peter, slaughter and eat!”	Ar óma túle senna: “Á orta, Péter, á nahta ar á mate!”
But Peter said: “By no means, Lord, for nothing defiled or unclean have I ever eaten!”	Mal eque Péter: “Laume, Heru, an munta vahtana ar úpoica oi amátien!”
And the voice said to him a second time: “Do not call defiled that God has cleansed!”	Ar i óma quente senna attea lú: “Áva esta vahtane yar Eru opoitie!”
This happened a third time, and then the vessel was taken into heaven.	Si martane neldea lú, ar tá i vene náne mapana mir menel.
While Peter was still very uncertain about what the vision that he had seen signified, behold! the men sent by Cornelius stood before the gate after asking their way to the house of Simon.	Íre Péter en náne ita iltanca pa mana i maur ya cennelyanes tenge, yé! i neri mentane lo Cornelio tarner epe i ando apa maquetie tielta i coanna Símonwa.
While Peter thought about the vision, the spirit said: “Behold! Three men are seeking you.	Lan Péter sanne pa i maur, i faire quente: “Yé! Neri nelde lye-cestear.
But go down and follow them, and do not be uncertain about anything, for I have sent them.”	Mal mena undu ar áte hilya, ar áva na iltanca pa aiqua, an inye ementaye te.”
Thus Peter went down and said to the men: “Behold, I am that you are seeking. What is your reason for coming here?”	Sie Péter ununte ar quente i nerinnar: “Yé, inye ná ye cestealde. Mana castalda tulien sir?”
They said: “Cornelius the centurion, a man just and reverent, of whom the whole nation of Jews speak well, has received a command through a holy angel that he was going to send for you, for you to come to his house and for him to hear your sayings.”	Quentelte: “Cornelio i tuxantur, nér faila ar ainocimya, pa ye i quanda nóre Yúraron quetir mai, acámie canwa ter aire vala i mentauvanes elyen, tulielyan coaryanna ar hlarieryan quetielyar.”
Then he requested of them to come inside, and he received them as guests.On the following day he arose and went with them, and some of the brothers in Joppa went with him.	Tá arcanes tello tule minna, ar camneset ve naşali.I hilyala auresse orontes ar lende oa aselte, ar ennoli i hánoron Yoppasse lender óse.
One day thereafter he went into Caesarea. Cornelius, waiting for their coming, beforehand called together the people of his family and his close friends.	Er ré epeta lendes mir Césarea. Cornelio, hópala tulieltan, nóvo yalde uo i queni nosseryo ar hari meldoryar.
When Peter went inside, Cornelius met him, fell down before his feet and worshipped him.	Íre Péter lende minna, Cornelio velde se, lantane undu epe talyat ar tyerne se.
But Peter raised him , saying: “Rise; I as well am a man!”	Mal Péter ortane se, quétala: “Á orta; yando inye atan ná!”
And when he spoke with him, he went inside and found numerous people assembled.	Ar íre quentes óse, lendes minna ar hirne rimbe ennoli ocómienwe.
And he said to them: “You know well how to a Jew is wholly against the Law to unite himself to a person of another nation, or to go into his house. And yet God showed me that I am not to call anyone defiled or unclean.	Ar quentes téna: “Istalde mai manen Yúran ná aqua ana i Şanye erta inse quenen hyana nóreo, hya mene mir coarya. Ananta Eru tanne nin i ávan esta aiquen vahtana hya úpoica.
Therefore I indeed came, without speaking against your calling when I was being summoned. Therefore I ask: What is your reason for sending to me?”	Etta é túlen, ú quetiéno ana yalielya íre anen tultaina. Etta maquetin: Mana castalya mentaven nin?”
And Cornelius said: “Four days ago, counting from this hour, I prayed in my house when behold! a man with bright garment stood before me	Ar Cornelio quente: “Auri canta yá, nótala lúme sinallo, hyamnen coanyasse íre yé! nér arwa calima larmo tarne epe ni
and said: “Cornelius, your prayer has been heard, and your gifts of mercy have been remembered before God.	ar quente: “Cornelio, hyamielya anaie hlárina, ar annalyar oraviéva anaier enyáline epe Eru.
Therefore send to Joppa and call Simon, who has the nickname Peter. This man is a guest in the house of another Simon, a leather-worker, by the sea.”	Etta á menta Yoppanna ar yala Símon, ye same i epesse Péter. Nér sina ná naşal coasse hyana Símonwa, alumo, ara i ear.”
Therefore in the same hour I sent to you, and you did well by coming here. And so in this hour all among us are here before God, to hear all the things that the Lord has commanded you to say.”	Etta mí imya lúme mentanen lyenna, ar carnel mai tuliénen sir. Ar sie lúme sinasse illi mici me nar sisse epe Eru, hlarien ilye i nati yar i Heru acánie lyen quete.”
Then Peter opened his mouth and said: “Truly I perceive that God does not heed faces ,	Tá Péter pantane antorya ar quente: “Nanwave tuntan i Eru ua cime cendeler,
but from every nation he receives well the person that fears him and does righteousness.	mal ilya nórello camis mai i quén ye ruce sello ar care failie.
He sent the word to sons of Israel to make known to them the gospel of peace through Jesus Chrsit; he is Lord of all.	Mentanes i quetta Israelindinnar carien sinwa tien i evandilyon raineva ter Yésus Hristo; isse Heru illion ná.
You know the saying that went through the entire Judea, beginning from Galilee after the baptism about which John talked –	Istalde i quetie ya lende ter i quanda Yúrea, yestala Alileallo apa i sumbie pa ya Yoháno carampe –
about Jesus from Nazareth, how God annointed him with Holy Spirit and with power, and he went through the land, doing good deeds and healing all upon which the Devil's power lay heavy, for God was with him.	pa Yésus Násaretello, manen Eru se-líve Aire Feanen ar túrenen, ar lendes ter i nóre, cárala mánar ar nestala illi innar i Arauco túre lumnane, an Eru náne óse.
And all among us are witnesses of the things that he did in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem alike, but they also killed him by hanging him on a tree.	Ar illi mici me nar astarmoli i nation yar carnes mí Yúraron nóre ar mi Yerúsalem véla, mal yú nacanteltes lingiénen se aldasse.
Him God raised on the third day and allowed him to show himself,	Sé Eru ortane i neldea auresse ar láve sen tana inse,
not to the entire people, but to witnesses chosen by God – to us, that ate and drank with him after his raising from dead.	lá i quanda lien, mal astarmolin cíline lo Eru – elmen, i manter ar suncer óse apa ortaverya et qualinallon.
And he commanded us to make known to the people, and to give them witness, that this man was whom God has placed as judge of living ones and dead ones.	Ar cannes men care sinwa i lien, ar anta tien vettie, i nér sina náne ye Eru apánie ve námo coirearon ar qualinaron.
About him all the Prophets spoke – that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins by his name.”	Pa sé ilye i Erutercánor quenter – in ilquen ye save sesse came apsenie úcariva esseryanen.”
While Peter still was still speaking about these things, the Holy Spirit fell upon all that heard the word.	Lan Péter en quétane pa nati sine, i Aire Fea lantane illinnar i hlasser i quetta.
And the faithful that had come with Peter, those that were of the circumcision, were filled with wonder since the gift of Holy Spirit was poured also upon non-Jews.	Ar i vorondar i náner tulinwe as Péter, té i náner i osciriéva, náner quátine elmendanen pan i anna Aire Feava náne ulyaina yando Úyúrannar.
And they heard them speak in tongues and praise God. Then Peter said: “Can anyone deny them the water, to stop from being baptized these men that have received the same Holy Spirit that we as well have received?”	An hlasseltet quéta lambalínen ar laitea Eru. Tá Péter quente: “Ma aiquen pole váquete ten i nén, pustien návello sumbane neri sine i acámier i imya Aire Fea ya yando elve acámier?”
And he commanded them to be baptized by the name of Jesus Christ. Then they requested of him that he would remain with them for some days.	Ar cannes tien náve sumbane Yésus Hristo essenen. Tá arcanelte sello i lemyumnes aselte ter aureli.
Now the apostles and the brother that were in Judea heard that some non-Jews also received God's word.	Sí i aposteli ar i hánor i enger Yúreasse hlasser in Úyúrali yú camner Eruo quetta.
But when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the people of circumcision quarreled with him,	Mal íre Péter lende ama Yerúsalemenna, i queni oscíriéva có$er óse,
saying that he had gone into the house of men that were not circumcized and had eaten with them.	quétala i lendes mir i coa neriva i úner oscírine ar mante aselte.
Then Peter began to tell them everything as it had happened, saying:	Tá Péter yestane nyare tien ilqua ve martanelyanes, quétala:
“I was in Joppa city when I saw a vision, a kind of vessel that came down like a huge sheet of linen, being sent down from heaven by its four corners, and it came near to me.	“Engen Yoppa·ostosse íre cennen maur, nostaleo vene ya túle undu ve hoa talat páşeva, mentaina undu menello vincaryainen canta, ar túles hare ninna.
Looking into it I watched and saw the four-legged creatures of earth and the wild beasts and the creeping things and the birds of heaven.	Yétala mina sa tirnen ar cenne cemeno cantalyar ar i hravani celvar ar i hlicilar ar menelo aiwi.
I also heard a voice say to me: Rise, Peter, slaughter and eat!	Yú hlassen óma quéta ninna: Á orta, Péter, á nahta ar mate!
But I said: By no means, Lord, for nothing defiled or unclean has ever come into my mouth!	Mal quenten: Laume, Heru, an munta vahtana hya úpoica oi utúlie mir antonya!
A second time the voice from heaven answered: Do not call unclean that God has cleansed!	Attea lú i óma menello hanquente: Áva esta úpoice yar Eru opoitie!
This happened a third time, and everthing was drawn back into heaven.	Si martane neldea lú, ar ilqua náne túcina nan mir menel.
And behold! in that moment three men stood by the house that we were in, for they were sent from Caesarea to me.	Ar yé! mi yana lú neri nelde tarner ara i coa yasse anelme, an anelte mentane Césareallo ninna.
Therefore the spirit commanded me to go with them, not being uncertain about anything. But these six brothers also went with me, and we went into the man's house.	Etta i faire canne nin mene aselte, lá nála iltanca pa aiqua. Mal hánor enque sine yú lender asinye, ar lendelme mir i coa i nerwa.
He told us how he saw the angel stand in his house, saying: Send some men to Joppa and summon Simon who has the nick-name Peter,	Nyarnes men manen cennes i vala tára mi coarya, quétala: Á menta nelli Yoppanna ar á tulta Símon ye same i epesse Péter,
and he will speak to you sayings by which you will be saved, you and your family.	ar quetuvas lyenna quetiéli yainen nauval rehtana, elye ar nosselya.
But when I began to speak, the spirit fell upon them just as it fell also upon us in the beginning.	Mal íre inye yestane quete, i faire lantane téna aqua ve lantanes yú venna i yestasse.
Then I recalled the Lord's saying, how he said: John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with Holy Spirit.	Tá enyalden i Heruo quetie, manen quentes: Yoháno sumbane nennen, mal elde nauvar sumbane Aire Feanen.
Therefore, if God gave the same gift to them as to ourselves that have believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who am I, that I will be able to stop God?”	Etta, qui Eru antane i imya anna tien ve elven i asávier mí Heru Yésus Hristo, man inye ná, i poluvan pusta Eru?”
Now when they heard these things, they said nothing more against him, and they gave glory to God, saying: “Then God has indeed given repentance leading to life also to non-Jews.”	Sí íre hlasselte nati sine, quentelte munta amba ana se, ar antanelte alcar Erun, quétala: “Tá Eru é ánie inwis tulyala coivienna yú Úyúrain.”
Therefore that were scattered by the tribulation that arose concerning Stephen went as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, but they spoke the word only to the Jews.	Etta i náner vintane i şangiénen ya oronte pa Stefáno lender tenna Fenícia ar Ciprus ar Antioc, mal quentelte i quetta rie i Yúrannar.
But among them were some men from Cyprus and Cyrene that came to Antioch and talked about the gospel of the Lord Jesus also to that spoke Greek.	Mal mici te enger nelli ho Ciprus ar Ciréne i túler Antiocenna ar caramper pa i evandilyon i Heru Yésuo yú innar quenter Hellenya.
Furthermore, the Lord's hand was with them, and a great number believed and turned themselves to the Lord.	Ente, i Heruo má enge aselte, ar hoa nóte sáver ar querner inte i Herunna.
The story about them came to the ears of the congregation which was in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas as far as Antioch.	I nyarna pa te túle i hlarunna i ocombeo ya enge Yerúsalemesse, ar mentanelte Varnavas tenna Antioc.
When he came there and saw God's grace, he had joy and urged them sincerely to remain in God's will,	Íre túles tar ar cenne Eruo lisse, sámes alasse ar hortane te holmo lemya Eruo indómesse,
for he was a good man and full of Holy Spirit and of faith. And a great crowd was added to the Lord.	an anes mane nér ar quanta Aire Feo ar saviéno. Ar hoa şanga náne napánina i Herun.
Then he went away to Tarsus to seek Saul,	Tá lendes oa Tarsusenna cestien Saul,
and after he found him, he led him to Antioch. Thus it came that for a full year they assembled with them in the congregation and taught a huge crowd, and in Antioch the disciples were for the first time called Christians .	ar apa hirnes hé, tulyanes hé Antiocenna. Sie túle i ter quanta loa ocomnette aselte i ocombesse ar peantanet hoa şanga, ar Antiocesse i hildor náner mí minya lú estaine Hristonduri.
In those days came prophets down from Jerusalem to Antioch.	Yane auressen túler Erutercánoli undu Yerúsalemello Antiocenna.
One among them, whose name was Agabus, arose and made known by the Spirit that was going to come a great famine upon the entire world. That indeed came in the days of Claudius.	Quén mici te, yeo esse náne Ahavo, oronte ar carne sinwa i Fairenen i tulumne túra saicele i quanda ambarenna. Ta é túle mi réryar Claurio.
Therefore that had more than their need chose to send assistance to the brothers that were in Judea.	Etta i sámer amba lá maurelta cilder menta mána i hánonnar i marner Yúreasse.
And so they did, sending it to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.	Ar sie carnelte, mentala sa i amyárannar Varnavas ar Saulo mánen.
Around that time Herod the King laid hands on some persons of the congregation, to evil to them.	Os yana lúme Herol i Aran panyane mát ennolinnar i ocombeo, carien tien ulco.
He killed Jacob, the brother of Jacob, by sword.	Nacantes Yácov, hánorya Yoháno, macilden.
Seeing how the Jews thought well about that, he also seized Peter. That happened in the days of unleavened breads.	Cénala manen i Yúrar sanner mai pa ta, yú nampes Péter. Ta martane auressen alapulúne massaron.
After he seized him, he put him in prison, giving him into the hands of four groups, each having four soldiers, for he intended to show him to the people.	Apa nampes hé, panyanes he mandosse, antala he mannar combion canta, ilya arwa ohtarion canta, an teldes tana he i lien apa i Lahtie.
Thus Peter was kept in prison, but the entire congregation was intensely praying to God for him.	Sie Péter náne hépina mandosse, mal i quanda ocombe veassenen hyámane Erunna sen.
In the night before Herod was going to lead him before the people, Peter was asleep, bound with two chains between to soldiers, and some guards before the door kept the gaol.	I lómisse nó Herol se-tulyumne epe i lienna, Péter náne lorna, nútina naxenen atta imbe ohtar atta, ar cundoli epe i fenda hemper i mando.
But behold! the Lord's angel stood by him, and a light shone in the room. Tapping Peter's body he woke him up, saying: “Rise quickly!” And his chains fell from his hands.	Mal yé! i Heruo vala tarne ara se, ar cala caltane i şambesse. Támala Pétero hroa hé eccoitane se, quétala: “Á orta lintave!” Ar naxeryar lantaner máryalto.
The angel said to him: “Put your girt around your hips and tie your shoes on your feet!” He did so. And he said to him: “Put your cloak on your body and follow me!”	I vala quente henna: “Á panya qualtalya os oşwelya ar nuta hyapalyat talulyatse!” Carnes sie. Ar hé quente senna: “Á panya collalya hroalyasse ar áni hilya!”
And he went outside and followed him, but he did now know that what happened by the angel was true. He supposed that he saw a vision.	Ar lendes ettenna ar hilyane hé, mal uas sinte i ya martane i valanen náne nanwa. Intyanes i cennes maur.
Passing by the first guard, and the second, they came to the iron gate leading into the city, and that opened itself to them. And after they went outside they walked down one street, and in that moment the angel went away from him.	Lahtala i minya cundo, ar i attea, túlette i angaina andonna tulyala mir i osto, ar ta pantanexe tun. Ar apa lendette ettenna vantanette undu er malle, ar mi yana lú i vala oante sello.
And Peter, finding himself, said: “Now I know that the Lord sent his angel and delivered me from Herod's hand and from everything that the people of the Jews is waiting for.»	Ar Péter, hírala inse, quente: “Sí istan i mentane i Heru valarya ar ni-etelehtane ho Herolo má ar ilquallo ya i Yúralie hópa.”
After making a consideration he went to the house of Mary, mother of John who had the nickname Mark. In the house a quite large number of people were assembled, praying.	Apa carie úvie lendes coanna Maríava, amil Yoháno ye sáme i epesse Marco. I coasse fárea nóte queniva náner ocómienwe, hyámala.
When he knocked on the door, a female slave whose name was Rhoda came to open,	Íre tambanes ana i fenna, inya mól yeo esse náne Rola túle latien,
and when she recognized Peter's voice, for her joy she did not open the gate, but ran inside and told that Peter was standing before the door.	ar íre atsintes Pétero óma, alasseryanen uas latyane i ando, mal nornes minna ar nyarne i Péter tára epe i ando.
They said to her: “You are out of your mind!” But she said forcefully that so it was . They said: “It is his angel.”	Quentelte senna: “Nalye ettesse sámalyo!” Mal quentes veassenen i sie ea. Quentelte: “Valarya ná.”
But Peter remained where he was, knocking. When they opened, they saw him and were startled.	Mal Péter lemne yasse enges, tambala. Íre latyanelte, cenneltes ar náner captane.
But he made a gesture to them with his hand, for them to be silent, and he told them everything about how the Lord led him out of gaol, and he said: “Tell these things to Jacob and to the brothers.” Then he went outside and went to another place.	Mal carnes tien hwerme máryanen, náveltan quilde, ar nyarnes tien ilqua pa manen i Heru se-tulyane et mandollo, ar eques: “Nyara nati sine Yácoven ar i hánoin.” Tá mennes ettenna ar lende hyana nómenna.
When morning came, there was no little exitement among the soldiers, about what really had happened to Peter.	Íre aure túle, ua enge pitya valme imíca i ohtari, pa mana nanwave náne martienwa Péteren.
Herod sought him, and when he did not find him, he commanded that one was to lead the soldiers away for punishment. And he went down from Judea to Caesarea and remained there.	Herol se-cestane, ar íre uas hirne se, cannes i mo tulyumne i ohtari oa paimen. Ar lendes undu Yúreallo Césareanna ar lemne tasse.
He had great wrath against the people of Tyre and Sidon. As one they came to him, and they spoke with Blastus, the chief of the bedchamber of the king, and gained his support. Thereafter they asked for peace, for their land received its food from that of the king.	Sámes túra rú$e i lienna mi Tír ar Síron. Ve er túlelte senna, ar carampelte as Vlasto, i turco i caimaşambo i aranwa, ar ñenter penastarya. Tá arcanelte raine, an nórelta camne mattarya ho ta i aranwa.
But on a set day Herod covered himself with a royal garment and sat down on the seat of judgement and talked to them.	Mal sátina auresse Herol tumpexe arna larmanen ar hamne undu i sondasse namiéva ar carampe téna.
Then the people cried: “A god's voice, and not of a man!”	Tá i lie yáme: “Aino óma, ar lá atano!”
In the same moment the Lord's angel struck him, since he did not give the glory to God. He was eaten by worms and expired.	Mí imya lú i Héruo vala pente se, pan uas antane i alcar Erun. Anes mátina lo leucali ar effirne.
But the Lord's word grew and spread.	Mal i Heruo quetta alle ar vintane.
Barnabas and Saul returned to Jerusalem after they completed their service, and they brought John, who had the nickname Mark.	Varnavas ar Saul nanwenner Yerúsalemenna apa telyanette núromolietta, ar tallette Yóhano, ye sáme i epesse Marco.
 were in Antioch some prophets and teachers in the congregation that was there, Barnabas and Simeon who was called Niger, and Lucius from Cyrene, and Manaen who was instructed with Herod the farthing-ruler, and Saul.	Enger Antiocesse Erutercánoli ar peantalli i ocombesse ya enge tasse, Varnavas ar Símeon ye náne estaina Niher, ar Lucio Cirenello, ar Manaen ye náne peantana as Herol i canastatur, ar Saul.
While they were doing service for the Lord and were fasting, the Holy Spirit said: “Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul, for the work to which I called them.”	Lan cáranelte núromolie i Herun ar hépaner lamate, i Aire Fea quente: “Ánin sate Varnavas ar Saul, i molien yanna yaldenyet.”
Then they kept a fast and prayed and put their hands upon them and let them go.	Tá hempelte lamate ar hyamner ar panyaner máltat tunna ar láver tun lelya.
Therefore these men, sent by the Holy Spirit, went down into Seleucia, and from there they sailed away to Cyprus.	Etta neri sine, mentane lo i Aire Fea, lender undu mir Seleucia, ar talo cirnette oa Ciprusenna.
And when they came into Salamis they made God's word known in the synagogues of the Jews. They also had John with them , helping them .	Ar íre túlette mir Salamis carnette Eruo quetta sinwa i Yúraron yomencoassen. Yando sámette Yoháno asette, manyala tu.
When they went through the entire island as far as Paphos, they met a man who was a wizard, a false prophet .	Íre lendelte ter i quanda tol tenna Pafos, veldelte nér ye náne sairon, hurutercáno.
He was with Sergius Paulus, the governor, who was an intelligent man. After he called Barnabas and Saul to himself, this man sought to hear God's word.	Enges as Serhio Paulo, i nórecáno, ye náne handa nér. Apa yaldes Varnavas yo Saul insenna, nér sina cestane hlare Eruo quetta.
But Elymas the wizard – for that is what his name means – stood against them , seeking to turn the governor away from the faith.	Mal Elimas i sairon – an ta ná ya esserya tea – tarne tunna, cestala quere i nórecáno oa i saviello.
Saul, who is also Paul , was filled with Holy Spirit, looked at him	Saul, ye ná yú Paulo, náne quátina Aire Feanen, yente se
and said: “O man full of every kind of lie and of every wicked deed, o son of the Devil, o enemy of all that is just, will you not stop twisting the straight roads of the Lord?	ar quente: “A nér quanta ilya nostaleo huruo ar ilya olca cardo, a yondo i Arauco, a ñotto ilyo ya faila ná, ma ual pustuva rice i Heruo tére maller?
And now, behold, the Lord's hand is upon you, and you will be blind, not seeing the sunlight for a time.” In the same moment mist and darkness fell upon him, and he went seeking people to lead him by the hand.	Ar sí, yé, i Héruo má ná lyenna, ar nauval laceníte, lá cénala i áre ter lúme.” Mí imya lú híşie ar mornie lantaner senna, ar lendes cestala ennoli tulien se i mánen.
Then the governor, when he saw what had happend, believed; and he was in wonder at the Lord's teaching.	Tá i nórecáno, íre cennes ya martanelyane, sáve; ar anes elmendasse i Heruo peantiénen.
The men that were with Paul now went by ship from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia. But John abandoned them and returned to Jerusalem.	I neri i enger as Paulo sí lender ciryanen Pafosello ar túler Peryanna Pamfiliasse. Mal Yoháno hehtane te ar nanwenne Yerúsalemenna.
But they , after they went away from Perga, came to Antioch in Pisidia. They went into the synagogue on the sabbath and sat down.	Ono tú, apa oantette Peryallo, túler Antiocenna Pisiriasse. Lendette mir i yomencoa i sendaresse ar hamunet.
After the reading out of the Law and of the Prophets, the synagogue chiefs sent to them, saying: “Men, brothers, if you have a word of comfort for the people, tell it!”	Apa i et-hentie i Şanyeva ar i Erutercánoiva, i yomencoanturi mentaner túna, quétala: “Neri, hánor, qui samiste quetta tiutaléva i lien, ása nyare!”
And Paul arose, and making a gesture with his hand he said: “Men, Israelites and you who fear God, listen!	Ar Paulo oronte, ar cárala hwerme máryanen quentes: “Neri, Israelyar ar elde i rucir Erullo, á lasta!
The God of our people Israel chose our fathers and made our people great while they were dwelling as foreigners in Egypt; then with a mighty arm he led them out from there,	Israel nórelvo Aino cilde atarilvar ar carne lielva túra lan máranelte ve aianor Mirrandoresse; tá taura rancunen te-tulyanes et talo,
and through forty years he gave them food in the wilderness.	ar ter loar os canaquean antanes tien matta i ravandasse.
After he destroyed ten peoples in Canaan, he caused them to possess their land	Apa nancarnes lier quean mi Canáan, tyarneset harya nórelta
for about four hundred and fifty years. Thereafter he gave them judges, until Samuel the Prophet.	loain os lepenquean ar tuxar canta. Epeta antanes tien námoli, tenna Sámuel i Erutercáno.
Then they requested a king, and God gave them Saul son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin. After forty years	Tá arcanelte aran, ar Eru antane tien Saul Císion, nér nosseo Venyamíno. Apa loar canaquean
he put him away and raised up David son of Jesse to be king, about whom he also said as a witness: I have found David son of Jesse a man according to my heart, who will do my entire will.	panyanes hé oa ar ortane Lavir Yessaion náven aran, pa ye yú quentes ve vettie: Ihírien Lavir Yessaion nér ve endanya, ye caruva quanda indómenya.
From this man's seed, God by his promise sent a Savior to Israel, Jesus,	Nér sino erdello, Eru vandaryanen mentane Rehtando Israelenna, Yésus,
after John, before his coming, made baptism of repentance known to the entire people of Israel.	apa Yoháno, nó tulierya, carne sumbie inwisteva sinwa i quanda lien Israélo.
But when John was soon going to complete his run, he said: Who do you suppose that I am? I am not he. But behold, after me comes a person whose shoes I am not worthy to loosen!	Mal íre Yoháno ron telyumne normerya, quentes: Man intyalde i nanye? Uan sé. Mal yé, apa ni túla quén yeva hyapat inye ua valda lehtien!
Men, brothers, sons of the kin of Abraham and the people among you that fear God: To you the word of this salvation has been sent.	Neri, hánor, yondor nosseo Avrahámo ar i queni mici le i rucir Erullo: Elmenna i quetta rehtie sino anaie mentana.
For that dwell in Jerusalem and their rulers did not know this person, but when they judged him they made true the sayings of the Prophets, which are being read aloud on every sabbath,	An i marir Yerúsalemesse ar turcoltar uar sinte quén sina, mal íre namneltes carnelte nanwe i Erutercánoron quetier, yar nar et-hentaine ilya sendaresse,
and though they did not find cause of death, they requested from Pilate that one was to kill him.	ar ómu ualte hirne casta qualmeo, arcanelte Pilátollo i mo nahtumne se.
After they completed all the things written about him, they took him down from the tree and put him in a grave.	Apa telyanelte ilye i nati técíne pa se, nampeltes undu i aldallo ar panyaner se noirisse.
But God raised him out of dead,	Mal Eru ortane se et qualinallon,
and through many days he was being seen by those that had gone with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, that are now his witnesses to the people.	ar ter rimbe réli anes cénaina lo i lendelyaner óse Alileallo Yerúsalemenna, i nar sí astarmoryar i lien.
For we make known to you the gospel about the promise given to the fathers:	Ar elme carir sinwa len i evandilyon pa i vanda antana i atarin:
that God has made it real to us , their children, by resurrecting Jesus, as is also written in the second psalm: You are my son, I begat you today.	in Eru acárie sa nanwa elven, hínaltar, enortavénen Yésus, ve yú técina ná i attea airelíresse: Tyé yondonya ná, ónen tye síra.
That he resurrected him out of dead, and that he will not return to a corrupt state, he has said thus: I will give to you David's mercies, the faithful ones.	I se-enortanes et qualinallon, ar in uas nanwenuva quelexima sómanna, equéties sie: Antauvan len Laviro oravier, i vorondar.
Therefore he also says in another psalm: You will not allow your faithful one to see a corrupt state.	Etta yú quetis hyana airelíresse: Ual lavuva vorondalyan cene quelexima sóma.
For David, after he was a servant to God's will in his own generation, died and as put with his fathers and saw a corrupt state.	An Lavir, apa anes núro Eruo nirmen véra nónareryasse, qualle ar náne panyana as ataryar ar cenne quelexima sóma.
But whom God raised did not see a corrupt state.	Mal ye Eru ortane ua cenne quelexima sóma.
Therefore you are to know – men, brothers – that through this man the forgiveness of sins is made known to you.	Etta alde ista – neri, hánor – i ter nér sina i apsenie úcariva ná len carna sinwa.
For the guilt from which it was not possible for you to be freed by the Law of Moses – concerning that anyone who believes is said without guilt .	Ar i cáma yallo lá ence len náve leryane Móseo Şanyenen – pa ta aiquen ye save ná quétina pen cáma.
Therefore see that which is said in the Prophets will not come upon you:	Etta cena i ya ná quétina i Erutercánossen ua tuluva lenna:
Look, you who speak mockery, and be filled with wonder, for I do a work in your days – a work that you will by no means believe even if anyone tells you about it!”	Á yéta, elde i quetir yaiwe, ar na quátine elmendanen, an carin carie réldassen – carie ya laume savuvalde yando qui aiquen nyare len pa sa!”
 leaving, the people asked to hear more about these matters on the following day of rest.	Autala, i queni arcaner hlare amba pa nattor sine i hilyala sendaresse.
Therefore, after the people that were assembled scattered, numerous ones among the Jews and the converts that feared God followed Paul and Barnabas, who spoke to them and urged them to remain in God's grace.	Etta, apa i queni i náner ocómienwe vintaner, rimbali imíca i Yúrar ar i quérinar i runcer Erullo hilyaner Paulo yo Varnavas, yet quentet téna ar te-hortanet lemya mi Eruo lisse.
On the following day of rest nearly the entire city assembled to hear the word of the Lord.	I hilyala sendaresse harive i quanda osto ocomne hlarien i Heruo quetta.
When the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with envy, and with blasphemy they spoke against the things said by Paul.	Íre i Yúrar cenner i şangar, anelte quátine hrucennen, ar naiquetiénen quentelte ana i nati quétine lo Paulo.
Then, talking with boldness, Paul and Barnabas said: “To you it was necessary to first speak God's word. Since you push it away and do not count yourselves worthy for eternal life, behold! we turn to non-Jews.	Tá, carpala veriénen, Paulo yo Varnavas quentet: “Elden mauyane minyave quete Eruo quetta. Pan nirildes oa ar uar note inde valde oira coivien, yé! querimme immet Úyúrannar.
For so the Lord has commanded us: I have put you like a light of nations, for you to be salvation to the remotest part of earth.”	An sie i Héru acánie ment: Apánien lye ve cala nórion, náveldan rehtie i anhaira rantanna cemeno.”
When the people of the nations heard that, they had joy and praised God's word, and all that were destined for eternal life believed.	Íre i queni i nórion hlasser ta, sámelte alasse ar laitaner Eruo quetta, ar illi i náner martyane oira coivien sáver.
Furthermore, the Lord's word was carried through the entire country.	Ente, i Heruo quetta náne cólina ter i quanda nórie.
But the Jews stirred up the reverent women and the prominent men in the city, and they raised up persecution against Paul and Barnabas and threw them beyond their borders.	Mal i Yúrar valtaner i ainocimye nissi ar i minde neri i ostosse, ar ortanelte roitie ana Paulo yo Varnavas ar hanter tu rénaltar pella.
They shook the dust from their feet and went to Iconium.	Pallette i asto taluttalto ar lendet Iconiumenna.
And the disciples were filled with joy and Holy Spirit.	Ar i hildor náner quátine alassenen ar Aire Feanen.
Now in Iconium they went together into the synagogue, and they spoke in a manner causing a huge multitude to believe, Jews and Greeks alike.	Sí Iconiumesse lendette uo mir i yomencoa, ar quentette mi lé tyarila hoa liyúme save, Yúrali ar Hellenyali véla.
But the Jews that did not believe stirred up the non-Jews and made them hostile against the brothers.	Mal i Yúrar i uar sáve valtaner i Úyúrar ar carner te cotye i hánonnar.
And yet, for a long time, they spoke with boldness by the power of the Lord, who witnessed to the word of his grace, by allowing signs and portents to happen through their hands.	Ananta, andave, quentette veriénen túrenen i Héruo, ye vettane i quettan lisseryo, laviénen tanwalin ar tannalin marta ter máttat.
But the multitude in the city was split, and some people were for the Jews and some others for the apostles.	Mal i liyúme i ostosse náne şanca, ar ennoli náner i Yúrain ar exeli i apostelin.
There was an uprising of non-Jews and the Jews alike, with their rulers, to humiliate them and to kill them with stones.	Enge amortie Úyúraron ar i Yúraron véla, as turiltar, nucumien tu ar nahtien tu sarninen.
When they perceived it, they fled to the cities in Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe and the country surrounding it.	Íre túnettes, úşette i ostonnar mi Licaonia, Listra ar Lerve ar i nórie pelila ta.
And there they made the gospel known.	Ar tasse carnette i evandilyon sinwa.
And in Lystra was a man sitting who could not stand on his feet. He was lame from his mother's womb and had not ever walked.	Ar Listrasse enge nér hamila ye ua polde tare talyatse. Anes lalevíte amilleryo mónallo ar ua oi vantanelyane.
This man listened to Paul when he talked, and when Paul looked at him and saw that he had the faith to be healed,	Nér sina lastane Paulonna íre carampes, ar íre Paulo yente se ar cenne i sámes i savie náven nestana,
he spoke to him with a mighty voice: “Stand up on your feet, straight!” And he jumped up and walked.	quentes senna taura ómanen: “Tara ama talulyatse, téra!” Ar campes ama ar vantane.
And the crowds, when they saw what Paul had done, raised their voices, saying in the tongue of Lycaonia: “The gods have become men and have come down to us!”	Ar i şangar, íre cennelte ya Paulo carnelyane, ortaner ómalta, quétala Licaonio lambesse: “I ainor olólier atani ar utúlier undu venna!”
And they called Barnabas Zeus, but Paul Hermes, since he was who spoke for them .	Ar estanelte Varnavas Seus, mal Paulo Hermes, pan isse náne ye quente tún.
And the priest of Zeus, whose temple was before the city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates and wanted to sacrifice with the crowds.	Ar i airimo Seuso, yeo corda náne epe i osto, talle mondoli ar riendeli i andonnar ar merne yace as i şangar.
But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard about that, they rent their cloaks and jumped into the crowd, crying	Mal íre i aposteli Varnavas yo Paulo hlasset pa ta, narcanette collattar ar campet mir i şanga, yámala
and saying: “Men, what is your reason for doing these things? Also we are men that suffer the same things that you suffer, and we make the gospel known to you, wishing that you will turn yourselves away from these empty things to the living God, who created heaven and earth and sea and all the things in them.	ar quétala: “Neri, mana castalda carien nati sine? Yú emme nát atani i perperir i imye nati yar elde perperir, ar carimme i evandilyon sinwa len, merila i queruvalde inde oa sine luste natillon i coirea Ainonna, ye ontane menel ar cemen ar ear ar ilye i nati mi tai.
In the past generations he allowed all the nations to go their own ways, though he did not let himself lack witness about his doing good, giving them rain from heaven and fruit in the proper time, filling their heart with food and joy.”	I vanwe nónaressen láves ilye i nórin lelya vére tieltassen, ómu uas láve insen pene vettie pa carierya márie, antala len ulo menello ar yáve i vanima lúmesse, quantala endalda mattanen ar alassenen.”
And speaking so they stopped – though with difficulty – the crowds from sacrificing to them .	Ar quétala sie pustanette – ómu urdiénen – i şangar yaciello tun.
But came some Jews from Antioch and Iconium and spoke to the crowds and changed their mind, and they threw stones at Paul and drew him out of the city, supposing that he was dead.	Mal túler Yúrali ho Antioc ar Iconium ar quenter i şangannar ar vistaner sámalta, ar hantelte sarni Paulonna ar tuncer se et i ostollo, intyala i anes qualina.
But when the disciples surrounded him, he arose and went into the city. And on the following day he went away with Barnabas, going to Derbe.	Mal íre i hildor pelder se, orontes ar menne mir i osto. Ar i hilyala auresse oantes as Varnavas, lelyala Lervenna.
And after they made known the gospel to that city and made a quite large number of disciples, they returned to Lystra and Iconium and Antioch.	Ar apa carnette sinwa i evandilyon osto tanan ar carnet fárea nóte hildolion, nanwennette ana Listra ar Iconium ar Antioc.
They strengthened the souls of the disciples, urging them to remain in the faith by saying: “It is necessary for us to go into God's kingdom through many tribulations.”	Turyanette i hildoron fear, hortala te lemya i saviesse quetiénen: “Mauya men mene mir Eruo aranie ter rimbe şangiéli.”
Furthermore, they appointed for them elders in every congregation, and by praying and fasting they gave them into hand of the Lord in whom they believed.	Ente, santette amyárali tien ilya ocombesse, ar hyamiénen ar lamatenen antanettet manna i Heruo yesse sávelte.
And they went through Pisidia and came into Pamphylia,	Ar lendette ter Pisiria ar túlet mir Pamfilia,
and after they spoke the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia.	ar apa quentette i quetta Peryasse, lendette undu Attalianna.
And from there they sailed away to Antioch, where beforehand God's grace was put in their care for the work they had now completed.	Ar talo cirnette oa Antiocenna, yasse nóvo Eruo lisse náne panyana hepiettasse i molien ya sí telyanelyanette.
After they came there and gathered the congregation, they told them about all the things that God had done through them , and that he had opened to the non-Jews the door of faith.	Apa túlette tar ar comyanet i ocombe, nyarnette pa ilye i nati yar Eru carnelyane ter tú, ar in aláties i Úyúrain i fenna saviéva.
Then they remained for not a short time with the disciples.	Tá lemnette lá şinta lúmesse as i hildor.
And some men came down from Judea and taught the brothers: “If you are not circumcised, by the tradition of Moses, it is not possible for you to obtain salvation.”	Ar nelli túler undu Yúreallo ar peantane i hánor: “Qui ualde oscírine, Móseo haimenen, lá ece len ñete rehtie.”
But after no small strife and quarreling among them and Paul and Barnabas, they arranged that Paul and Barnabas and some others from them were going to go up to the apostles and elders in Jerusalem concerning this dispute.	Mal apa lá pitya cos ar costie mici té ar Paulo yo Varnavas, partanelte i Paulo yo Varnavas ar exeli ho té menumner ama i apostelinnar ar amyárannar Yerúsalemesse pa cos sina.
Therefore they, sent by the congregation, went through Phoenicia and Samaria, telling how some non-Jews were converted , and they brought great joy to the brothers.	Etta té, mentane lo i ocombe, lender ter Foinicia ar Samária, nyárala manen Úyúrar querner inte, ar tallelte túra alasse i hánoin.
When they came to Jerusalem they were received by the congregation and the apostles and the elder men, and they told about all the things that God did by them.	Íre túlelte Yerúsalemenna anelte cámine lo i ocombe ar i aposteli ar i amyáre neri, ar nyarnelte pa ilye i nati yar Eru carne ténen.
And yet some persons from the order of the Pharisees that believed, arose from their seats and said: “It is necessary to circumcize them and command them to keep the law of Moses.”	Ananta ennoli i herenello i Farisaron i sáver, oronter sondaltallon ar quenter: “Mauya osciritat ar cane tien himya Móseo şanye.”
And the apostles and the elders assembled to make a consideration about this matter.	Ar i aposteli ar i amyárar ocomner carien úvie pa natto sina.
After much dispute Peter arose and said to them: “Men, brothers, you know that from the first days God's choice was that through my mouth the nations were going to hear the word of the gospel, for them to believe.	Apa olya cos Péter oronte ar quente téna: “Neri, hánor, istalde i ho i minye auri Eruo cilme náne i ter ninya anto i nóri hlarumner i quetta i evandilyono, savieltan.
Thus God, who knows the hearts, witnessed to them by giving them the Holy Spirit, as he also did to us.	Sie Eru, ye ista i endar, vettane tien antavénen tien i Aire Fea, ve yú carnes elven.
In nothing did he behave towards us and them in a different manner, after cleansing their heart by faith.	Mi munta lenganes ven ar tien mi alavéla lé, apa poitie endalta saviénen.
Therefore, now what is your reason for testing God, by putting on the neck of these disciples a yoke that it was not possible to us and to our fathers alike to bear?	Etta, sí mana castalda tyastien Eru, paniénen sine hildoron axesse yalta ya ua ence elven ar atarilvain véla cole?
On the contrary, we believe that we will be saved by the grace of the Lord Jesus, as also these people believe.	Úsie, savilve i nauvalve rehtane i Heru Yésuo lissenen, ve yú queni sine savir.”
And the entire multitude was made silent, and they listened to Barnabas and Paul when they told about all the signs and portents that God had done among the nations through them .	Ar i quanda liyúme náne carna quilda, ar lastanelte Varnavas yo Paulonna íre nyarnette pa ilye i tannar ar tanwar yar Eru carnelyane imíca i nóri ter tú.
After they stopped talking, Jacob said: “Men, brothers listen to me!	Apa pustanette carpa, Yácov quente: “Neri, hánor, á lasta ninna!
Symeon has told how God first gave heed to the nations to take out of them a people for his name.	Símeon anyárie manen Eru minyave cimne i nóri mapien et tailo lie esseryan.
And the words of the prophets say the same thing, as is written:	Ar i Erutercánoron quettar quetir i imya nat, ve ná técina:
'After these things I will return and I will rebuild David's fallen shelter, and I will rebuild its ruinous parts and I will raise it agan,	'Apa nati sine nanwenuvan ar encarastuvan Laviro lantienwa cauma, ar encarastuvan atalantie rantaryar ar ortauvan sa ata,
causing that remained among the men to seek the Lord, with people from all the nations,' says the Lord who is doing these things,	tyárala i lemyar imíca i atani cesta i Héru, as ennoli ho ilye i nóri,' quete i Héru ye cára nati sine,
known from of old.	sinwe et yalúmello.
Therefore my judgment is that we are not to cause difficulty to the people from the nations that turn themselves to God,	Etta námienya ná i ávalve tyare urdie i quenin i nórellon i querir inte Erunna,
but that we will write to them that it is necessary for them to keep themselves away from idols and fornication and from what is strangled, and from blood.	mal i tecuvalve téna i mauya tien hepe inte oa ho cordoni ar hrupuhtie ar yallo quórina ná, ar sercello.
For from ancient times Moses has had in all cities people that make him known, since he is read out in the synagogies on every day of rest.”	An enwine lúmellon Móses asámie ilye ostossen ennoli i carir se sinwa, pan náse et-hentaina i yomencoassen ilya sendaresse.”
Then it seemed well to the apostles and the elders and to the whole congregation to send some chosen men from them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas: Judas who was called Barsabbas, and Silas, prominent men among the brothers,	Tá nemne mai i apostelin ar i amyárain ar i quanda ocomben menta cíline nelli ho té Antiocenna as Paulo yo Varnavas: Yúras ye náne estaina Varsappas, ar Sílas, minde neri imíca i hánor,
and by their hand they wrote:“The apostles and the elders, your brothers, to the brothers that are in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia, they that are of the nations: Greetings! .	ar máltanen tencelte: “I aposteli ar i amyárar, hánolyar, i hánoin i ear mi Antioc ar Siria ar Cilicia, té i nar i nórion: Hara máriesse!
Since we have heard that some people from among us have caused you difficulty with their words, trying to overturn your soul though we have not given them instructions,	Pan ahlárielme in ennoli ho mici mé atyárier len urdie quettaltainen, névala nuquere fealda ómu ualme ánie tien peantier,
we have with one mind made the choice that we will send some men to you with our dear ones, Barnabas and Paul,	er sámanen acárielme i cilme i mentauvalme nelli lenna as meldalmar, Varnavas yo Paulo,
men that have put their life in danger, for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.	neri i apánier coivietta raxesse, Herulva Yésus Hristo essen.
Therefore we send Judas and Silas, to tell you the same things by word.	Etta mentalme Yúras ar Sílas, nyarien i imye nati quettanen.
For it seemed well to the Holy Spirit and to us not to put another burden upon you except these things that are necessary:	An nemne mai i Aire Fean ar elmen lá napane hyana cólo lenna hequa nati sine yar mauyar:
Keep yourselves away from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from strangled animals, and from fornication. If you keep yourselves away from these things, you will do well. Health to you!”	Hepa inde oa ho nati yácine cordonin, ar sercello, ar quórine celvallon, ar hrupuhtiello. Qui hepildexer oa sine natillon, caruvalde mai. Mále len!”
Thus, when these men were being sent, they went down to Antioch, and they gathered the multitude and gave them the letter.	Sie, íre neri sine náner mentaine, lendelte undu Antiocenna, ar comyanelte i liyúme ar antaner téna i menta.
And after they read it, they had joy by the encouragement .	Ar apa hentaneltes, sámelte alasse i hortalénen.
And Judas and Silas, since also they were prophets, urged the brothers with many words and strengthened them.	Ar Yúras ar Sílas, pan yú tú nánet Erutercánor, hortaner i hánor rimbe quettalínen ar turyaner te.
After dwelling there for a time, they were released by the brothers back to that sent them.	Apa marie tasse ter lúme, anelte lehtane lo i hánor nan innar mentaner te.
But Silas thought it was good for him to tarry there.	Ono Sílas sanne i náne mára sen lemya tasse.
But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch, where they and numerous others made known the gospel about the Lord's word.	Mal Paulo yo Varnavas termarnet mi Antioc, yasse tú ar rimbe exeli carner sinwa i evandilyon pa i Heruo quetta.
After some days Paul said to Barnabas: “Let us return and see to the brothers in every city in which we made known God's word, to see how they are doing.”	Apa réli Paulo quente Varnavanna: “Angwe nanwene ar cene i hánonnar ilya ostosse yasse carnengwe sinwa i Heruo quetta, cenien manen cáralte.”
But Barnabas wished to bring with himself also John, who was called Mark.	Mal Varnavas merne tala as inse yú Yoháno, ye náne estaina Marco.
But Paul did not think it was good to bring the men who abandoned them in Pamphylia and did not go with them to the work.	Mal Paulo ua sanne i náne mára tala i nér ye tu-hehtane Pamfiliasse ar ua lende asette i molienna.
The anger between them was so sharp that it caused them to abandon one another, and Barnabas took Mark and sailed away to Cyprus.	I rúşe imbe tu náne ta aica i tyarneset hehta quén i exe, ar Varnavas nampe Marco ar cirne oa Ciprusenna.
Paul chose Silas and went away after the Lord's grace was put in his keeping by the brothers.	Paulo cilde Sílas ar lende oa apa i Heruo lisse náne panyana hepieryasse lo i hánor.
He went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the congregations.	Lendes ter Siria ar Cilicia, turyala i ocombi.
Then he came to Derbe and also to Lystra. And behold! was there a disciple whose name was Timothy, the son of a believing Jewish woman, but of a Greek father.	Tá túles Lervenna ar yú Listranna. Ar yé! enge tasse hildo yeo esse náne Timoşeo, i yondo savila Yúra nisso, mal Hellenya ataro.
Of him all the brotehrs in Lystra and Iconium spoke well.	Pa sé ilye i hánor mi Listra ar Iconium caramper mai.
Paul wished that he would come with him, and he took and circumsized him, by reason of the Jews that were in those regions, for all knew that his father was Greek.	Paulo merne i tulumnes óse, ar nampeses ar oscirne se, castanen i Yúraron i enger tane ménassen, an illi sinter i atarya náne Hellenya.
But when they went through the cities, they commanded them to keep the statutes fixed by the apostles and elders that were in Jerusalem.	Mal íre lendette ter i ostor, cannette tien hepe i namnar tulcane lo i aposteli ar amyárar i enger Yerúsalemesse.
Thus the congregations were being strengthened in the faith and rose in number from day to day.	Sie i ocombi náner turyaine i saviesse ar oronter nótesse aurello aurenna.
Furthermore, they went through Phrygia and the country of Galatia, since the Holy Spirit forbade to speak the word in Asia,	Ente, lendette ter Frihia ar i Alátia-nórie, pan i Aire Fea váquente quete i quetta Asiasse,
but when they came to Mysia, they tried to go to Bithynia, but Jesus' spirit did not allow them .	mal íre túlette Misianna, névette lelya Vitinianna, mal Yésuo faire ua láve tun.
After they went through Mysia they came down to Troas.	Apa lendette ter Misia túlette undu Troasenna.
And in the night Paul received a vision: A man from Macedonia stood requesting of him, saying: “Come over into Macedonia and help us!”	Ar i lómisse Paulo camne maur: Nér Maceroniallo tarne arcala sello, quétala: “Tula olla mir Maceronia ar áme manya!”
After he saw the vision, we sought to go to Macedonia, supposing that God summoned us to make the gospel known to them.	Apa cennes i maur, cestanelme lelya Maceronianna, intyala in Eru tultane me carien i evandilyon sinwa tien.
Therefore we sailed from Troas and went straight to Samothrace, but on the following day to Neapolis	Etta cirnelme Troasello ar lender térave Samoşrácenna, mal i hilyala auresse ana Neapolis
and from there to Philippi, a colony , which is the most prominent city in the Macedonia region. We halted in this city, remaining for some days.	ar talo Filippinna, vinyamar, ya ná i amminda osto Maceronia·ménasse. Hautanelme osto sinasse, lemyala ter réli.
And on the day of rest we went outside though the gate, to a place beside a river which we thought was a place of prayer, and we sat down and talked to the women that were assembled.	Ar i sendaresse lendelme ettenna ter i ando, nómenna ara síre ya sannelme náne nóme hyamiéva, ar hamunelme ar caramper i nissennar i náner ocómienwe.
And a woman whose name was Lydia, a trader in purple cloth from the city of Thyatira who worshipped God, listened, and the Lord opened her heart to give heed to the things that Paul spoke.	Ar lastane nís yeo esse náne Liria, macar luicarne lanneo Şiatíra·ostollo ye tyerne Eru, ar i Heru latyane endarya cimien i nati yar Paulo quétane.
After she and his family were baptized, she said in entreaty: “If you judge me faithful to the Lord, come into my house and remain!” And she compelled us to come.	Apa isse ar nosserya náner sumbane, quentes arcandesse: “Qui namilde ni voronda i Herun, tula mir coanya ar á lemya!” Ar me-mauyanes tule.
And it came , when we were going to the place of prayer, that a female slave met us, having a spirit of foresight . She brought her masters much money by using foresight.	Ar túle, íre ménanelme i nómenna hyamiéva, i me-velde inya mól arwa faireo apacenwa. Taldes heruryain olya telpe yuhtiénen apacen.
This woman followed Paul and us, crying these words: “These men are slaves of God Most High, and they make known to you the path of salvation.”	Nís sina hilyane Paulo ar me, yámala quettar sine: “Neri sine nar Aino Antaro móli, ar carilte sinwa len i tie rehtiéva.”
She did so for many days. Weary, Paul finally turned and said to the spirit: “I command you by the name of Jesus Christ: Come out of her!” And it came out in the same hour.	Carnes sie rimbe aurelissen. Lumba, Paulo teldave quernexe ar quente i fairenna: “Canin lyen Yésus Hristo essenen: Tula et sello!” Ar hé ettúle i imya lúmesse.
When her masters saw that their hope of gain was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them to the place of commerce, to the rulers.	Íre heruryar cenner in estelelta ñétiéva vanwa né, nampelte Paulo yo Sílas ar tuncer tu i nómenna mancaléva, i turconnar.
They brought them to the judges and said: “These men trouble our city, being Jewish,	Tulyaneltet i námonnar ar quenter: “Neri sine tarastar ostolva, nála Yúrar,
and they make known customs that are not allowed for us as Romans to receive or follow.”	ar caritte sinwe haimeli yar uar lávine ven ve Rómear came hya hilya.”
And the crowed arose against them , and the judges, after the tore their cloaks from them , commanded that one was to beat them with sticks .	Ar i şanga oronte túna, ar i námor, apa narcanelte collattar tullo, canner i mo palpumne tu rundainen.
After they gave them many blows, they threw them into gaol, commanding the goalkeeper to keep them securely.	Apa antanelte tun rimbe taramboli, hanteltet mir mando, cánala i mandocundon hepitat varnave.
After they received such command, he threw them into the inmost gaol and fastened the their feet to the block .	Apa camnelte taite canwa, hanteset mir i ammitya mando ar tance taluttat i panonna.
But around the midst of the night Paul and Silas were praying, praising God with song, and the people in the gaol listened to them.	Mal os i lómio ende Paulo yo Sílas hyámaner, laitala Eru lírinen, ar i queni i mandosse lastaner tu.
Suddenly a great earthquake happened, causing the foundations of the gaol to shake. Furthermore, in the same moment all the doors were opened, and the chains of all were loosened.	Rincanen túra cempalie martane, tyárala i mando talmar pale. Ente, mí imya lú ilye i fennar náner pantane, ar illion limili náner lehtane.
The gaoler, when he was awakened and saw the doors of the prison opened, drew his sword and was going to kill himself, supposing that everyone in the gaol was gone.	I mandocundo, íre nánes eccoitana ar cenne i mando fennar pantane, tunce macilya ar nahtumne inse, intyala in ilquen i mandosse vanwa né.
But Paul cried with a mighty voice: “Do not harm yourself, for we are all here!”	Mal Paulo yáme taura ómanen: “Áva harna imle, an nalme illi sisse!”
And he asked for lights and jumped inside, and trembling he fell down before Paul and Silas.	Ar arcanes calali ar campe minna, ar pálala lantanes undu epe Paulo ar Sílas.
And he led them outside and said: “Lords, what is necessary for me to do to obtain salvation?”	Ar tulyanes tu ettenna ar quente: “Heruvi, mana mauya nin care ñetien rehtie?”
They said: “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your family.”	Quentette: “Sava i Heru Yésusse, ar nauval rehtana, elye ar nosselya.”
And they spoke the Lord's word to him and to all that were in his house.	Ar quentette i Heruo quetta senna ar ilyannar i enger coaryasse.
And he brought them with him in that hour and washed their stripes, and he and all that were with him were baptized without waiting.	Ar talleset óse yana lúmesse ar sóve rimpeltar, ar isse ar illi i enger óse náner sumbane pen hopie.
And he brought them into his house and put food on the table before them , and he had great joy with his entire familty, since he found faith in God.	Ar talleset mir coarya ar panyane matta i sarnosse epe tu, ar sámes túra alasse as quanda nosserya, pan hirnes savie Erusse.
When day came, the judges sent the club-bearers to say: “Release those men!”	Íre aure túle, i námor mentaner i rundacolindor quetien: “Á lehta neri tane!”
And the gaoler told these words to Paul: “The judges have sent some men to release you ! Therefore, now come out and go away in peace!”	Ar i mandocundo nyarne quettar sine Paulon: “I námor ementayer nelli leryaven let! Etta, sí ettula ar á auta rainesse!”
But Paul said to them: “They flogged us before the people, without judgement, men that are Romans, and they threw us into gaol – and now they are throwing us out secretly? By no means! Let them come and lead us outside!”	Mal Paulo quente téna: “Rípelte met epe i lie, ú námiéno, neri i nar Rómear, ar hantelte met mir mando – ar sí et-hátalte met nuldave? Laume! Lava tén tule ar tulya met ettenna!”
The club-bearers told these words to the judges. They were scared when they heard that they were Romans.	I rundacolindor nyarner quettar sine i námoin. Anelte ruhtane íre hlasselte i anette Rómear.
Therefore they came and made a petition to them , and after they brought them outside, they asked that they would go away from the city.	Etta túlelte ar carner arcande tun, ar apa talleltet ettenna, arcanelte i autumnette i ostollo.
But they came out from the prison and went to the house of Lydia, and when they saw the brothers they urged them. Then they went away.	Mal túlette et i mandollo ar lendet coaryanna Liria, ar íre cennette i hánor hortanettet. Tá oantette.
Now they went through Amphipolis and Apollonia and came to Thessalonica, where was a Jewish synagogue.	Sí lendette ter Amfipolis ar Apollonia ar túlet Şessalonicanna, yasse enge Yúra yomencoa.
Thus, by his habit, Paul went in to them, and on three sabbaths he spoke with them about the Scriptures,	Sie, haimeryanen, Paulo lende minna téna, ar sendaressen nelde quentes aselte pa i Tehteler,
giving them understanding and showing that it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and rise from dead, and he said: “This is the Christ, this Jesus that I make known to you.”	antala ten hande ar tánala i mauyane i Hriston perpere ar orta qualinallon, ar eques: “Si i Hristo ná, Yésus sina ye carin sinwa len.”
Therefore some people among them believed and stuck to Paul and Silas, with a great multitude of the Greeks that served God, and not a few of the most prominent women.	Etta ennoli mici te sáver ar himyaner Paulo ar Sílas, as hoa liyúme i Hellenyaron i tyerner Eru, ar lá mancali i amminde nission.
But the Jews were being filled with envy, and after they gathered some wicked men from the place of commerce and formed a crowd, they caused an uprising in the city. They fell upon the house of Jason and sought to bring them ouside to the people.	Mal i Yúrar náner quátaine hrúcennen, ar apa comyanelte olce nelli i nómello mancaléva ar carner şanga, tyarnelte amortie i ostosse. Lantanelte coaryanna Yáson ar cestaner tala tu ettenna i lienna.
When they did not find them they drew Jason and some brothers to the rulers of the city, crying: “These people that have turned the world upside down have now come here as well,	Íre ualte hirne tu tuncelte Yáson ar hánoli i turconnar i osto, yámala: “Queni sine i nuequérier ambar sí utúlier yú sir,
and Jason has received them into his house! And all these people stand against the commands of the Emperor, for they say that is another king, Jesus.”	ar Yáson acámie te mir coarya! Ar ilye queni sine tarir ana i canwar i Ingaráno, an quetilte i ea hyana aran, Yésus.”
They stirred up the crowd and the rulers of the city that heard these things,	Valtanelte i şanga ar i osto turcor i hlasser nati sine,
and after taking sufficient security from Jason and the others they released them.	ar apa mapie fárea varnasse ho Yáson ar i exi lehtaneltet.
Without waiting, in that night the brothers sent both Paul and Silas to Beroea, and when they came there, they went into the synagogue of the Jews.	Pen hopie, lóme yanasse i hánor mentaner yúyo Paulo ar Sílas Veroianna, ar íre túlette tar, lendette mir i yomencoa i Yúraron.
They were nobler than those that lived in Thessalonica, and they received the word with all good will, and every day they searched the Scriptures to see if these things were so.	Té náner arte lá i marner Şessalonicasse, ar camnelte i quetta ilya mára nirmenen, ar ilya auresse cenşelte i Tehteler cenien qui nati sine náner sie.
Therefore numerous ones among them believed, and so did not a few prominent Greek women, also numerous men.	Etta rimbali mici te sáver, ar sie carner lá nótime minde Hellenye nisseli, yú rimbe nelli.
But when the Jews from Thessalonica learnt that God's word was made known also in Beroea by Paul, they came there stirring up and disturbing the crowds.	Mal íre i Yúrar Şessalonicallo parner in Eruo quetta náne carna sinwa yando Veroiasse lo Paulo, túlelte tar valtala ar tarastala i şangar.
Without waiting the brothers sent Paul away, as far as the sea, but Silas and Timothy alike remained were they were.	Pen hopie i hánor mentaner Paulo oa, tenna i ear, mal Sílas ar Timoşeo véla lemner yasse engette.
But that led Paul brought him as far as Athens, and they returned bringing his command to Silas and Timothy: It was necessary for them to come as soon as they could .	Mal i tulyaner Paulo taller se tenna Aşen, ar nanwennelte tálala canwarya Sílas ar Timoşeonna: Mauyane tun tule lintiettanen.
While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, his spirit was being disturned by seeing how the city was full of idols.	Lan Paulo hópane tun mi Aşen, fairerya náne tarastaina ceniénen manen i osto náne quanta cordonion.
Therefore he talked in the synagoge with the Jews and the others that worshipped God – also in the place of commerce, with those that came there.	Etta carampes i yomencoasse as i Yúrar ar i exi i tyerner Eru – yú i nómesse mancaléva, as i túler tar.
But some among the philosophers, the Epicureans and the Stoics alike, went into dispute with him, and some people among them said: “What does this idle-talking person want to say?” Others said: “It seems he is making known some foreign gods.” That was since he talked about the gospel about Jesus and the resurrection.	Mal ennoli imíca i sailiendili, i Epicurear ar i Stoici véla, lender mir cos óse, ar queneli mici te quenter: “Mana nyatila quén sina mere quete?” Exeli quenter: “Neme i cáras sinwe ettelie ainoli.” Ta náne pan carampes pa i evandilyon pa Yésus ar i enortave.
Therefore they took him and led him into the Areopagus, saying: “May we know what it is, this teaching that you are speaking?	Etta nampeltes ar tulyane se mir i Areopahus, quétala: “Ma lertalme ista mana nás, peantie sina ya quétal?
For you bring some ideas that are strange to our ears. Therefore we want to know what these things mean.”	An talas noali yar nar ettelie hlarulmant. Etta merilme ista mana nati sine tear.”
For all in Athens and all the foreigners there set aside every free moment to do nothing except tell or hear news.	An illi mi Aşen ar ilye i ettelear tasse satir ilya lerina lú carien munta hequa nyare hya hlare sinyar.
Paul stood up in the middle of the Areopagus and said: “Men from Athens, I perceive that in all things you have an awe for the gods greater than what others have.	Paulo oronte endesse Areopahusso ar quente: “Neri Aşenello, tuntan i mi ilye nati samilde áya i ainoin túra lá ya exi samir.
For while I was going through the city, looking at the things that you worship, I found also an alter on which it was written: “To an unknown god.” Therefore, which you worship without knowing it, that I am making known to you.	An lan ménanen ter i osto, yétala i nati yar tyerilde, hirnen yú yangwa yasse náne técina: “Úsinwa ainon.” Etta, ya tyerilde pen istie sa, ta inye cára sinwa len.
The God who made the earth and everything that is in it does not dwell in temples made by hands.	I Aino ye carne i mar ar ilqua ya ea sasse ua mare cordassen cárine mainen.
Furthermore, he is not being served by men's hands, as if he has need of a single thing, he himself giving to all life and breath and all things.	Ente, uas veuyaina atanion mainen, ve au samis maure erya natwa, isse immo antala illin coivie ar şúle ar ilye nati.
And he made out of one man every nation of men, for them to dwell on the entire surface of earth, and he appointed the times and the borders for the dwelling of men,	Ar carnes et er atanello ilya nóre ataniva, marieltan i quanda palúresse cemeno, ar santes i lúmi ar i rénar vehten atanion,
for them to seek God, if they can reach towards him and find him, though indeed he is not far from a single person among us.	cestialtan Eru, qui ece tien rahta senna ar hiritas, ómu é uas haira ho erya quén mici vi.
For by him we have life and we move and we exist, as also some poets among you have said: 'For we are also his kin.'	An issenen samilve coivie ar levilve ar ealve, ve yando maitalli mici lé equétier: 'An nalve yú nosseryo.'
Therefore, seeing that we are God's kin, we do not do well if we think about the Deity that he is like gold or silver or stone, or an artifact formed by man's art or thought.	Etta, cenila i nalve Eruo nosse, ualve care mai qui sanalve pa i Aino i náse ve malta hya telpe hya ondo, hya tanwe cátina atano curwenen hya sanwenen.
True, God showed patience in these times when people have been lacking knowledge, but now he says to men in every place that it is necessary for them to find repentance.	Nanwa, Eru tanne cóle mi lúmi sine yassen queni epénier istya, mal sí quetis i atannar ilya nómesse i mauya tien hire inwis.
For he has set a day in which he will judge earth in righteousness by a man that he has chosen, and he has given to all men security by raising him out of dead.”	An asáties ré yasse namuvas cemen failiesse nernen ye icílies, ar ánies ilye atanin varnasse ortavénen se et qualinallon.”
But when they heard about resurrection of dead, some among them spoke mockery, while others said: “We will hear you again about this matter another time.”	Mal íre hlasselte pa enortave qualinaiva, ennoli quenter yaiwe, íre exeli quenter: “Lye-hlaruvalme ata pa natto sina yú hyana lúmesse.”
Thus Paul went out from their midst,	Sie Paulo etelende et endeltallo,
but some people stuck to him and believed. Among them were Dionysius who was a judge in the Areopagus, and a woman called Damaris, and some others beside them .	mal ennoli himyaner se ar sáver. Mici té náne Lionisio ye náne námo mí Areopahus, ar nís estaina Lamaris, ar exeli ara tu.
After these things he went away from Athens and came to Corinth.	Apa nati sine oantes ho Aşen ar túle Corintenna.
And he found a Jew called Aquila, a man born in Pontus, who a short time ago had come from Italy with Priscilla his wife, since by the command of Claudius all Jews had gone away from Rome. And he came to them,	Ar hirnes Yúra estaina Aquila, nér nóna mi Pontus, ye şinta lúme yá náne tulinwa Italiallo as Priscilla verirya, pan Claurio canwanen ilye Yúrar oantelyaner Rómallo. Ar túles túna,
and since they had the same kind of work, he remained with them and laboured. For their work was to make tents.	ar pan sámelte i imya nostale moliéva, lemnes asette ar móle. An molielta náne care lancoar.
But he talked in the synagogue every sabbath and caused Jews and Greeks to believe.	Mal carampes i yomencoasse ilya sendaresse ar tyarne Yúrar ar Hellenyar save.
When Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul completely gave himself to making the Word known, witnessing to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.	Íre Sílas ar Timoşeo ununter Maceroniallo, Paulo aqua antanexe carien i Quetta sinwa, vettala i Yúrain i Yésus ná i Hristo.
But when they stood against him and spoke mockery, he shook the dust from his garments and said to them: “May you blood come upon your own head! I am clean. From now I go to non-Jews.”	Mal íre tarnelte ana se ar quenter yaiwie, palles i asto larmaryallon ar quente téna: “Nai sercelda tuluva véra careldanna! Inye poica ná. Ho sí lelyan Úyúrannar.”
And he moved from there and went into the house of a person called Titius Justus, who worshipped God. His house was built into the same building where the synagogue was.	Ar léves talo ar lende mir i coa quenwa estaina Titio Yusto, ye tyerne Eru. Coarya náne carastana mir i imya ataque yasse i yomencoa enge.
Crispus the synagogue ruler received the faith in the Lord with his entire family, and after hearing, numerous ones among the people of Corinth believed and were baptized.	Crispo i yomencoantur camne i savie i Herusse as quanda nosserya, ar apa hlarie, rimbali imíca i queni Corinto sáver ar náner sumbane.
And in a vision in the night the Lord said to Paul: “Do not fear, but speak and do not be silent,	Ar mi maur i lómisse i Heru quente Paulonna: “Áva ruce, mal queta ar áva na quilda,
for I am with you and no one will do to you evil, for I have numerous people in this city.”	an ean aselye ar úquen caruva lyen ulco, an samin rimbe ennoli osto sinasse.”
And he remained there for one year and six months, teaching among them God's word.	Ar termarnes tasse ter er loa ar astar enque, peantala mici te Eruo quetta.
Now when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one mind arose against Paul and led him to the judgement seat,	Sí íre Allio náne nóreturco Acaio, i Yúrar er sámanen oronter Paulonna ar tulyaner hé i námosondanna,
saying: “This man causes men to believe it is necessary for them to worship God in a manner against the Law.”	quétala: “Nér sina tyare atani save i mauya tien tyere Eru mi lé ana i Şanye.”
But when Paul was going to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews: “If the matter were about evil or a wicked deed, I had reason to have patience with you.	Mal íre Paulo pantumne antorya, Allio quente i Yúrannar: “Au i natto náne pa ulco hya olca carda, sámen casta samien cóle aselde.
But if the matter is about quarrelings about some words and names and the Law that you have, it is necessary for you to see to it. I do not want to be judge concerning these things.”	Mal qui i natto ná pa costiéli pa quettali ar esseli ar i Şanye ya samilde, mauya elden cene sanna. Inye ua mere náve námo pa nati sine.”
And he drove them away from the judgement seat.	Ar éles te oa i námosondallo.
But all among them seized Sosthenes the synagogue ruler and beat him before the judgement seat. But Gallio gave heed to none of these things.	Ono illi mici te namper Sostenes i yomencoantur ar palpaner se epe i námosonda. Mal Allio cimne munta sine nation.
But after remaining there for many days more, Paul said farewell to the brothers and sailed away to Syria, and with him went Priscilla and Aquila. He went away after cutting his hair in Cencreai, for he had a pledge.	Mal apa lemie tasse ter an rimbe réli, Paulo quente namárie i hánonnar ar cirne oa Sirianna, ar óse lendet Priscilla yo Aquila. Oantes apa cirie findelerya mi Cencreai, an sámes vanda.
They came to Ephesus, and he left them there, but he went into the synagogue and spoke with the Jews.	Túlelte Efesusenna, ar tu-hehtanes tasse, mal isse lende mir i yomencoa ar quente as i Yúrar.
When they requested from him to stay with them for a longer time, he did not want to,	Íre arcanelte senna lemya aselte an anda lúmesse, uas merne,
but said farewell and told them: “I will return to you again, if God wishes.” And he sailed away to Ephesus and came down to Caesarea. And he went up and greeted the congregation, and went down to Antioch.	mal quentes namárie ar nyarne tien: “Nanwenuvan lenna ata, qui Eru mere.” Ar cirnes oa Efesusello ar túle undu Césareanna. Ar lendes ama ar suilane i ocombe, ar ununte Antiocenna.
And after he dwelt there for a time he went away and travelled from place to place through the country of Alatia and Phrygia, strengthening the disciples.	Ar apa marnes tasse ter lúme oantes ar lende nómello nómenna ter Alatia·nórie ar Frihia, tulcala i hildor.
Now came to Ephesus a Jew whose name was Apollo, born in Alexandria. He knew to talk well and was mighty in the Scriptures.	Sí túle Efesusenna Yúra yeo esse náne Apollo, nóna Alexandriasse. Sintes carpa mai ar náne taura i Tehtelessen.
He was instructed in hte Lord's way, and since he was glowing with the spirit, he talked and taught what was true concerning Jesus, be he knew only John's baptism.	Anes peantana mí Heruo tie, ar pan anes lúşina i fairenen, carampes ar peantanes ya nanwa náne pa Yésus, mal sintes rie Yoháno sumbie.
And this man began to speak boldly in the synagogue. When Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him with them and led him to a deeper understanding of God's way.	Ar nér sina yestane quete canyave i yomencoasse. Íre Priscilla yo Aquila hlasset se, nampettes asette ar tulyane se ambe tumna handenna i tieo Eruo.
Furthermore, since he wished to go into Achaia, the brothers wrote to the disciples, urging them to receive him well . Thus, when he came there, he greatly helped those who believed by the grace.	Ente, pan mernes lelya mir Acaia, i hánor tencer i hildonnar, hortala i camumneltes mai. Sie, íre túles tar, ita manyanes i sáver i Erulissenen.
And with vigour he indicated the mistake of the Jews, showing from the scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.	Ar veassenen tenges i Yúraron loima, tánala i Tehtelellon i Yésus ná i Hristo.
While Apollos was in Corinth it happened that Paul went through the inlands as far as Ephesus. And he found some disciples	Íre Apollo enge Corintesse túle i Paulo lende ter i mitye nórier tenna Efesus. Ar hirnes hildoli
and said to them: “Did you receive Holy Spirit when you believed?” They said to him: “Indeed we have not heard that is a Holy Spirit.”	ar quente téna: “Ma camnelde Aire Fea íre sávelde?” Quentelte senna: “Laume ahlárielme i ea Aire Fea.”
And he said: “In what, then, were you baptized?” They answered: “In the baptism of John.”	Ar eques: “Mi mana, tá, anelde sumbane?” Hanquentelte: “Mi Yoháno sumbie.”
Paul said: “John baptized with the baptism of mind-change, urging the people to believe in who was going to come after him – that is, in Jesus.”	Eque Paulo: “Yoháno sumbane i sumbiénen inwisteva, hortala i lie save yesse tulumne apa se – ta ná, Yésusse.”
When they heard that, they were baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.	Íre hlasselte ta, anelte sumbane mi Yésus Hristo esse.
And when Paul put his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke in tongues and talked like prophets.	Ar íre Paulo panyane máryat tesse, i Aire Fea túle téna, ar quentelte lambelissen ar caramper ve Erutercánor.
Their whole number was around twelve men.	Quanda nótelta náne os neri yunque.
He went into the synagogue and spoke boldly for three months, talking and bringing others to an understanding of God's kingdom.	Lendes mir i yomencoa ar quente canyave astassen nelde, carpala ar tálala exeli handenna pa Eruo aranie.
But when some people made themselves hard and did not believe, speaking mockery about the Way before the multitude, he abandoned them and separated the disciples from them, on every day giving talks in the hall of Tyranus.	Mal íre ennoli carner inte sarde ar uar sáve, quétala yaiwe pa i Tie epe i liyúme, te-hehtanes ar hyarne i hildor ho te, ilya auresse antala carpiéli mi Tiráno ataque.
That happened throughout two years, and thus all that dwelt in Asia heard God's word, Jews and Greeks alike.	Ta martane ter loa atta, ar sie illi i marner Asiasse hlasser Eruo quetta, Yúrar ar Hellenyar véla.
God did some mighty deeds, beyond what was usual, by Paul's hands.	Eru carne taure cardali, han ya senwa né, Paulo mánten.
Thus even clothes and aprons were carried from his skin and put on the sick ones, and the illnesses went away from them, and the wicked spirits came out.	Sie yando lanneli ar quiltalanneli náner cóline helmaryallo ar panyane i hlaiwassen, ar i hlíwi váner tello, ar i olce fairi ettúler.
But were also some wandering Jews among those that threw out demons who tried to speak Jesus' name against who were possessed by demons: “I command you by the Jesus whom Paul makes known.”	Mal enger yú vantala Yúrali imíca i et-hanter raucor i néver quete Yésuo esse innar náner haryaine lo raucor: “Canin le i Yésunen ye Paulo care sinwa.”
 were seven sons of a man called Sceva, a Jewish high priest, that did so.	Enger yondor otso nero estaina Sceva, Yúra héra airimo, i carner sie.
But in answer the wicked spirit said to them: “Jesus I know, and I have heard about Paul, but who are you?”	Mal hanquentasse i olca faire quente téna: “Yésus istan, ar ahlárien pa Paulo, mal man nar elde?”
And the man possessed by the wicked spirit fell upon them and conquered them all, causing them to run wounded and naked out of that house.	Ar i nér haryaina lo i olca faire lantane téna ar turune te illi, tyárala te nore harne ar helde et sana coallo.
This matter came to the knowledge of all, of Jews and of Greeks alike, those who dwelt in Ephesus. And fear fell upon all among them, and the name of the Lord Jesus was being praised.	Natto sina túle illion istyanna, Yúraron ar Hellenyaron véla, té i marner Efesusse. Ar caure lantane ilyannar mici te, ar i Heru Yésuo esse náne laitaina.
And numerous ones of who believed came and spoke openly about their deeds.	Ar rimbali ion sáver túler ar quenter pantave pa cardaltar.
Not a few among those that before used magic gathered their books and burned them before the eyes of all. And they calculated the sum that they paid for them and found that their value was fifty thousand silver-pieces.	Lá mancali imíca i nóvo yuhtaner ñúle comyaner parmaltar ar urtaner tai epe illion hendu. Ar onontelte i nonwe ya paityanelte tain ar hirner i mirwielta náne telpemittar quaihúmi lepenquean.
Thus, with power, the Lord's word grew and was made mighty.	Sie, túrenen, i Heruo quetta alle ar náne carna taura.
After these things were finisehd, Paul made his goal that after he went through Macedonia and Achaia he was gong to travel to Jerusalem, saying: “After I shall come there it is also necessary for me to see Rome.”	Apa nati sine náner telyane, Paulo carne ennerya in apa lendes ter Maceronia ar Acaia lelyumnes Yerúsalemenna, quétala: “Apa tuluvan tar mauya nin yú cene Róma.”
He sent to Macedonia two of his servants, Timothy and Erastus, but he himself remained for a time in Asia.	Mentanes Maceronianna atta núroryaron, Timoşeo ar Erasto, mal isse lemne ter lúme Asiasse.
Around that time was not a small uprising concerning the Way.	Os lúme yana enge lá pitya amortie pa i Tie.
For a man called Demetrius, a silversmith, gave no small wealth to the craftsmen by making silver shrines of Artemis.	An nér estaina Lemetrio, telpetan, antane lá pitya lar i tanoin cariénen telpine yánar Artemisso.
And he gathered them and who worked with such things and said: “Men, you know well that by this our work we have our wealth.	Ar comyanes té ar i móler as taiti nati ar quente: “Neri, istalde mai i sina moliénen samilve larelva.
And you see and you hear how not only in Ephesus, but in nearly all Asia, this Paul has brought a big crowd to a new belief, by saying that those gods that are made by hands are not gods at all.	Ar cenilde ar hlarilde manen lá rie Efesusse, mal harive quanda Asiasse, Paulo sina atálie hoa şanga vinya savienna, quetiénen i tane ainor i nar cárine mainen laume nar ainor.
Furthermore, is a danger that not only this our work will be despised, but also that the temple of the great Artemis will be counted as nothing, putting an end also to her greatness, before which all Asia and world bow.”	Ente, ea raxe i lá rie sina molielva nauva nattíraina, mal yú i corda i túra Artemisso nauva nótaina ve munta, metyala yú túrierya, epe ya quanda Asia ar ambar luhtar.”
Hearing this and being filled with anger, the men cried: “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”	Hlárala si ar nála quátaina rúşenen, i neri yámer: “Túra ná Artemis Efesuyaron!”
Thus the city was being filled with confusion, and with one mind they went rushing into the theater, seizing Gaius and Aristarchus and bringing them with them by force. They were people from Macedonia traveling with Paul.	Sie i osto náne quátaina rúciniénen, ar er sámanen lendelte rimpe mir i tirmen, mápala Aio ar Aristarco ar tu-tálala aselte nirmenen. Anette ennoli Maceroniallo lelyala as Paulo.
Paul himself wanted to go inside to the people, but the disciples were not willling to let him.	Paulo inse merne lelya minna i lienna, mal i hildor úner mérala lave sen.
Some among the rulers of Asia, that were his friends, sent to him and asked of him that he was not going to put himself in danger in the theater.	Ennoli imíca Asio turcor, i náner meldoryar, mentaner senna ar arcaner sello in ávas panyumne inse raxesse i tirmende.
Some cried one thing and others another thing, and the greater number did not know the reason by which they were assembled.	Ennoli yámer er nat ar exeli hyana nat, ar i amarimbar mici te uar sinte i casta yanen anelte ocómiéla.
Therefore they together brought forward Alexander out of the crowd, for the Jews pushed him forward.	Etta uo tallelte Alexander et i şangallo, an i Yúrar se-ninder ompa.
But when they understood that he was a Jew, they cried with one voice for around two hours: “Great is Artemis of Ephesians!”	Mal íre hanyanelte i anes Yúra, yámelte er ómanen ter os lúme atta: “Túra ná Artemis Efesuyaron.”
After the city scribe made the crowd quiet, he said: “Men, who is among men who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is guardian of the temple of the great Artemis and of the image that fell from heaven?	Apa i ostotecindo carne i şanga quilda, quentes: “Neri, man ea mici atani ye ua ista in Efesuyaron osto ná cundo i cordo i túra Artemisso ar i emmo ya lantane menello?
Therefore, since one cannot deny that, you will do well if you are still and do nothing without thought.	Etta, pan mo ua pole láquete ta, caruvalde mai qui nalde quilde ar carir munta pen sanwe.
For you have brought these men that are not robbers of temples and have not spoken mockery against our goddess.	An atálielde neri sine i uar pilur cordaron ar uar equétie yaime ainilvanna.
Therefore, if Demetrius and the craftsmen with him have a dispute with anyone, are court days and are proconsuls : Let them bring the disputes that they have, one with the other, to the judges.	Etta, qui Lemetrio ar i tanor óse samir cos as aiquen, ear auri namiéva ar ear nóreturcor: Lava tien tala i costi yar samilte, quén as i exe, i námonnar.
But if you seek anything beyond that, it is necessary that a regular assembly settles it.	Mal qui cestalde aiqua han ta, mauya i şanya combe tulca sa.
For is danger that complaints about uprising will be brought against us after what has happened today, for we do not have a single reason to give concerning this clamour.”	An ea raxe i nurreli pa amortie nauvar talaine venna apa ya amartie síra, an ualve same erya casta antaven pa yalme sina.”
And after he said that, he send the ones having assembled away.	Ar apa quentes ta, mentanes i ocómienwar oa.
When the uprising was over, Paul summoned the disciples, and after he encouraged them and said farewell to them, he went away to go into Macedonia.	Íre i amortie náne vanwa, Paulo tultane i hildor, ar apa hortanes te ar quente námarie téna, lendes oa menien mir Maceronia.
After he went through those regions and encouraged that were there with numerous words, he came into Greece.	Apa lendes ter sane ménar ar hortane i enger tasse rimbe quettalínen, túles mir Hellas.
And after he remained three months there, he was going to said away to Syrian, but since the Jews made plans against him, he made the choice that he was going to return through Macedonia.	Ar apa termarnes astar nelde tasse, cirumnes oa Sirianna, mal pan i Yúrar carner panoli ana se, carnes i cilme i nanwenumnes ter Maceronia.
With him on the journey were Sosipather the son of Pyrrhus from Beroea, Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica, and Gaius from Derbe, and Timothy and Tryphimus from Asia.	Óse i lendasse enger Sosipater yondorya Pirro Veroiallo, Aristarco ar Secundo Şessalonicallo, ar Aio Lervello, ar Timoşeo ar Trifimo Asiallo.
They went before us and waited for us in Troas,	Té lender epe me ar homper men Troasse,
but we sailed away from Philippi after the days of Unleavened Breads, and we came to them in Troas before five days were gone. There we remained for seven days.	mal elme cirner oa Filippillo apa i auri Alapúline Mastaron, ar túlelme téna Troasse nó auri lempe náner vanwe. Tasse lemnelme ter rí otso.
On the first day of the week, when we were assembled to break bread, Paul talked to them, since he was going away on the following day, and he was speaking until the middle of the night.	I minya auresse i otsolo, íre anelme ocómienwe racien massa, Paulo carampe téna, pan autumnes i hilyala auresse, ar quétanes tenna ende i lómio.
But were many lamps in the upper hall where we were assembled.	Mal enger rimbe calmali i oromardesse yasse anelme ocómienwe.
Sitting by the window was a young man called Eutychus, who fell into deep sleep while Paul was talking, and collapsing in sleep he fell down from the third floor and was dead when he was lifted up.	Hámala ara i lattin enge nessa nér estaina Eutico, ye lantane mir núra húme íre Paulo quétane, ar taltala húmesse lantanes undu i neldea talamello ar náne qualina íre anes ortana.
But Paul went down, threw himself upon him, put his arms around him and said: “Do not make clamour, for he is still alive.”	Mal Paulo ununte, hantanexe senna, panyane rancuryat os se ar quente: “Áva care yalme, an náse en coirea.”
Then he returned up, broke the bread and ate, and he talped until dawn and then went away.	Tá nanwennes ama, rance i massa ar mante, ar carampes tenna ára ar tá oante.
But the boy they brough away alive, and they were comforted beyond measure.	Mal i seldo tallelte oa coirea, ar anelte tiutane lesta pella.
Now we went before them to the boat and sailed away to Assos, where we were going to receive Paul into the ship. For after he gave commands about that, he himself wished to go on his feet .	Sí lendelme epe te i luntenna ar cirner oa Assosenna, yasse camumnelme Paulo mir i cirya. An apa antanes canwar pa ta, isse merne lelya talyanten.
When he came as far as the place where we were in Assos, we received him into the boat and went to Mitylene.	Íre túles tenna i nóme yasse anelme mi Assos, camnelmes mir i lunte ar lender Mitilenenna.
And after we sailed from there on the following day we came beside Chios, and after one more day we reached as far as Samos, and on the following day we came into Miletus.	Ar apa cirnelme talo i hilyala auresse túlelme ara Cios, ar apa an ré rahtanelme tenna Samos, ar i hilyala auresse túlelme mir Miletus.
For Paul made the choice that he would pass over Ephesus, not wishing to halt in Asia, for he was traveling in urgency: If he could he wanted to reach Jerusalem before the Festival of Seven Weeks .	An Paulo carne i cilme i lahtumnes Efesus, lá merila hauta Asiasse, an anes lelyala hormesse: Qui poldes mernes tene Yerúsalemenna nó i Aşar Otsolaron Otso.
But from Miletus he sent to Ephesus and summoned the elders of the congregation.	Mal ho Miletus mentanes Efesusenna ar tultane i amyárar i ocombeo.
When they came to him he said to them: “You know well how from the first day that I came to Asia I was with you the whole time,	Íre túlelte senna quentes téna: “Istalde mai manen i minya aurello ya túlen Asianna anen aselde i quanda lúmesse,
working for the Lord in all lowliness, having tears and suffering the tribulations that happened to me by the evil plans of the Jews,	molila i Herun mi ilya naldie, arwa nírion ar perperila i şangier yar martaner nin i Yúraron ulce panoinen,
while I did not keep from you a single thing beneficial to you, or failed to instruct you before the people and in the houses.	íre uan hempe lello erya nat aşea len, hya loitane peanta len epe i lie ar i coassen.
But I witnessed to Jews and to Greeks alike about repentance towards God and faith in our Lord, Jesus.	Mal vettanenye Yúrain ar Hellenyain véla pa inwis Erunna ar savie Herulvasse, Yésus.
And now, behold, bound in the spirit I go to Jerusalem, though I do not know that will happen to me in it,	Ar sí, yé, nútina i fairesse lelyan Yerúsalemenna, ómu uan ista yar martuvar nin sasse,
except that in every city the Holy Spirit witnesses to me that bonds and tribulations are waiting for me.	hequa in ilya ostosse i Aire Fea vetta nin i núteli ar şangiéli hópar nin.
And yet I do not count my life that dear to me, if it is possible for me to complete my ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus: Witnessing about the gospel of the grace of God.	Ananta uan note coivienya ta melda nin, qui ece nin telya núromolienya ya camnen i Heru Yésullo: Vettie pa i evandilyon i lisseo Eruo.
And now, behold, I know that you will not see my face again, you all among whom I walked, making known the kingdom	Ar sí, yé, inye ista in ualde cenuva cendelenya ata, elde illi imíca i vantanenye, carila sinwa i aranie.
Therefore I witness to all among you that I am clean from the blood of all men,	Etta vettan illin mici le i nanye poica i sercello ilye atanion,
for I have not kept myself from telling you God's entire plan.	an uan ehépie imne nyariello len Eruo quanda pano.
Watch yourselves and the entire flock which the Holy Spirit has put in your patronage . Be shepherds for the Lord's congregation, which he gained with his own blood.	Cima inde ar i quanda lámáre ya i Aire Fea apánie ortírieldasse. Na mavari i Heruo ocomben, ya ñentes véra serceryanen.
I know that after I pass, oppressive wolves will come among you, that do not have mercy on the flock,	Inye ista i apa autan, lumne ñarmoli tuluvar mici le, i uar oravuva i lámáresse,
and from yourselves will arise some men that speak twisted things, to draw away the disicples after themselves.	ar ho elde ortuvar nelli i quetir rícine natali, tucien oa i hildor apa inte.
Therefore be awake, recalling how through three years, at night and at day, I did not stop instructing you with tears.	Etta na coive, enyalila manen ter loar nelde, lómisse yo auresse, uan pustane peanta len nírelínen.
And now I give you over to God and to the word of his grace, which can build you up and give you your part as heirs, with all the sanctified ones.	Ar sí antan le olla Erun ar lisseryo quettan, ya pole carasta le ama ar anta len rantalda ve indyoni, as ilye i airintar.
Silver or gold or garment I have not sought from anyone.	Telpe hya malta hya larma uan ecestie ho aiquen.
You yourselves know that these hands have given me and who were with me our needs.	Elde istar i mát sine ániet nin ar in enger asinye maurelmar.
I always showed you that when you so work it is necessary for you to help that are weak and to recall the word with the Lord Jesus himself spoke: Giving is a joy greater than receiving.

And after he spoke these words, he fell upon his knees with all among them and prayed.	Ar apa quentes quettar sine, lantanes occaryanta as illi mici te ar hyamne.
 was quite a lot of wailing among them all, and they fell upon Paul's neck and kissed him.	Enge fárea yaimie mici te illi, ar lantanelte Paulo axenna ar minquer se.
For above everything they were being tormented by the word that he said, that they were not going to see his face again. Then they followed him to the boat.	An or ilqua anelte ñwalyaine i quettanen ya quentes, in ualte cenumne cendelerya ata. Tá hilyaneltes i luntenna.
After we compelled ourselves to leave them and sailed away, we went straight to Cos, but on the following day to Rhodos, and from there to Patara.	Apa mauyanelme imme hehta te ar cirner oa, lendelme térave Cosenna, mal i hilyala auresse Rolosenna, ar talo Pataranna.
And after he found a boat that was to go to Phoenicia, we went aboard and sailed away.	Ar apa hirnelme lunte ya lelyumne Foicinianna, lendelme mina sa ar cirner oa.
After we saw Cyprus, we went past it on the left, sailed to Syria and came to Tyre, for that was the destination of the goods on the boat.	Apa cennelme Cipros, lendelme ara sa i hyaryasse, cirner Sirianna ar túler Tírenna, an ta náne i enne i armaron i luntesse.
We sought the disciples and found them, and we remained there for seven days. But by the Spirit they said to Paul: “Do not set foot in Jerusalem!”	Cestanelme i hildor ar hirner te, ar lemnelme tasse ter rí otso. Mal i Fairenen quentelte Paulonna: “Áva panya tál Yerúsalemesse!”
But when the days were past, we went forth and went on our way. All among them, with the women and children, followed us as far as the outside of the city. And after falling to our knees on the beach we prayed,	Mal íre i auri náner vanwe, etelendelme ar menner tielmasse. Illi mici te, as i nissi ar híni, hilyaner me tenna ette i osto. Ar apa lantie occalmanta i fárasse hyamnelme,
and we said farewell to one another, and we went into the boat, but they returned home.	ar quentelme namárie quén i exenna, ar lendelme mir i lunte, mal té nanwenner marda.
From Tyre we came to Ptolemais, completing the voyage . We greeted the brothers and remained one day with them.	Ho Tír túlelme Ptolemaisenna, telyala i luntelenda. Suilanelme i hánor ar lemner er ré aselte.
On hte following day we sailed away and came to Caesarea, and we went into the house of Philip, a man who was making known the gospel. He was among the Seven, and we remained with him.	I hilyala auresse cirnelme oa ar túler Césareanna, ar lendelme mir coarya Filip, nér ye cárane sinwa i evandilyon. Anes imíca i Otso, ar lemnelme óse.
 were with this man four daughters, virgins, who had a prophet's gift.	Enger as nér sina selyer canta, vendeli, i sámer Erutercáno anna.
But while we remained there for a number of days, a prophet whose name was Agabus came down from Judea, and he came to us and took the belt of Paul. He bound his own feet and hands and said: “Thus says the Holy Spirit: The man who owns this belt the Jews in Jerusalem will bind, and they will give him over to non-Jews.”	Mal lan lemnelme tasse ter nóte aurion, Erutercáno yeo esse náne Ahavo túle undu Yúreallo, ar túles menna ar nampe i quilta Paulova. Nuntes vére talyat ar máryat ar quente: “Sin quete i Aire Fea: I nér ye harya quilta sina i Yúrar Yerúsalemesse nutuvar, ar antauvaltes olla Úyúrain.”
When we heard this, we and who dwelt there alike asked of him: “Do not go up to Jerusalem!”	Íre hlasselme si, elme ar i marner tasse véla arcaner sello: “Áva lelya ama Yerúsalemenna!”
Then Paul answered: “What are you doing, wailing and breaking my heart? For I am ready, not just to be bound, but also to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.”	Tá Paulo hanquente: “Mana cáralde, yaimie ar rácala endanya? An inye manwa ná, lá rie náven nútina, mal yú qualien Yerúsalemesse i essen i Heru Yésuo.”
When it was not possible for us to change his mind, we stopped asking and said: “Let the Lord's will happen.”	Íre lá ence men vista sámarya, pustanelme arca ar quenter: “Lava i Heruo indómen marta.”
After these days we prepared and went on our journey to Jerusalem.	Apa auri sine manwanelme ar lender lendalmasse Yerúsalemenna.
But some of the discipes from Jerusalem also went with us, to bring us to the man in whose house we were going to dwell: Mnason, who was of the first disciples.	Mal ennoli i hildoron Yerúsalemello yú lender aselme, talien me i nerenna yeva coasse marumnelme: Mnason, ye náne i minye hildoron.
When we came to Jerusalem, the brothers received us in joy.	Íre túlelme Yerúsalemenna, i hánor me-camner mi alasse.
But on the following day Paul went with us into the house of James, and all the elders were there.	Mal i hilyala auresse Paulo lende aselme mir coarya Yácov, ar ilye i amyárar enger tasse.
And they greeted them and told about every single thing that God did among the nations by his ministry.	Ar suilaneltet ar nyarner pa ilya erya nat ya Eru carne imíca i nóri núromolieryanen.
After hearing that they gave glory to God, and they said to him: “You behold, brother, how are multitudes that believe among the Jews, and all among them burn for the Law.	Apa hlarie ta antanelte alcar Erun, ar quentelte senna: “Yétal, háno, manen ear liyúmeli i savir imíca i Yúrar, ar illi mici te uryar i Şanyen.
But they have heard that it has been said concerning you that you have taught among the nations that it is necessary for them to stand away from Moses, teaching them that they are not to circumcise their children or follow the customs.	Mal ahlárielte in anaie quétina pa elye i peániel imíca i nóri i mauya tien tare oa Mósello, peantala tien i ávalte oscire hínaltar hya hilya i haimi.
What, then, are we to do? It is certain that they will hear that you have come.	Mana, tá, caruvalve? Tanca ná i hlaruvalte in utúliel.
Therefore do this thing that we tell you: are with us four men that have a vow.	Etta cara nat sina ya nyarilme len: Ear aselme neri canta i samir vanda.
Bring them with you and purify yourself with them, and you pay for them, for them to cut the hair off their head. Then all will understand that what they have heard about you is not true, but that you follow the Law and keep it.	Áte tala aselye ar á poita imle aselte, ar alye paitya tien, cirieltan i findele careltallo. Tá illi hanyuvar i ya ahlárielte pa lye ua nanwa, mal i elye hilya i Şanye ar hepe sa.
Concerning the non-Jews that believe we have written to them, commanding that it is necessary for them to keep themselves away from what has been sacrificed to idols, from blood, from flesh of strangled animals and from fornication.”	Pa i Úyúrar i savir elve etécier téna, canila i mauya tien hepe inte oa yallo anaie yácina cordonin, ho serce, ho hráve quórine celvaron ar ho hrupuhtie.”
Then Paul brought the men with him, and on the following day he purified himself with them and went into the temple, to make known the date when their purification was going to be completed and the sacrifice was going to be brought for each one among them.	Tá Paulo talle i neri óse, ar i hilyala auresse poines inse aselte ar lende mir i corda, carien sinwa i ré yasse sovallelta nauvane telyana ar i yanca nauvane talaina ilquenen mici te.
But shortly before the seven days were complete, the Jews from Asia saw him in the temple and caused an uprising among the crowd, and they put their hands on him	Mal şintave nó i rí otso náner telyane, i Yúrar Asiallo cenner se i cordasse ar tyarne amortie imíca i şanga, ar panyanelte máltat sesse
and cried: “Men of Israel, help! This man is who teaches everyone in every place against the people and the Law, and against this place! Furthermore, he has brought some Greeks into the temple and has defiled this holy place!”	ar yámer: “Neri Israélo, á manya! Nér sina ná ye peanta ilquenen mi ilya nóme ana i lie ar i Şanye, ar ana nóme sina! Ente, atálies Hellenyali mir i corda ar avahtaye XXX aire nóme sina!”
For before they saw Tryphimus from Ephesus in the city with him, and they supposed that Paul brought him into the temple.	An nóvo cennelte Trifimo Efesusello i ostosse óse, ar intyanelte i Paulo talle se mir i corda.
And the whole city was stirred, and the people ran together, and they seized Paul and dragged him out of the temple. In the same moment the gates were closed.	Ar i quanda osto náne valtana, ar i lie norne uo, ar nampelte Paulo ar tuncer se et i cordallo. Mí imya lú i andor náner avalatyane.
And while they sought to kill him, word came to the chief of the army, about all of Jerusalem being in disorder.	Ar íre cestenelte nahta se, quetta túle i turconna i hosseo pa quanda Yerúsalem nála rúcina.
Without waiting he brought some soldiers and centurions and ran down to them. Seeing the chief and the soldiers they stopped beating Paul.	Pen hopie talles ohtalli ar tuxantulli ar norne undu téna. Cénala i turco ar i ohtari pustanelte palpa Paulo.
Then the army commander came and took him and commanded: “Bind him with two chains!” And he asked about who he was and about what he had done.	Tá i hosseturco túle hare ar nampe se ar canne: “Áse nute limil attanen!” Ar maquentes pa man anes ar pa mana carnelyanes.
But some in the crowd cried one thing and others another thing. By reason of the noise he could learn nothing certain, and he commanded that they were to bring Paul to the camp.	Mal ennoli i şangasse yámer er nat ar exeli hyana nat. Castanen i ramo poldes pare munta tulca, ar cannes i talumnelte Paulo i estolienna.
But when he came to the steps it was necessary for the soldiers to carry him, because of the violence of the crowd.	Mal íre túles i tyellennar mauyane i ohtarin colitas, i şango ormenen.
For the multitude of the people followed him, crying: “Kill him!”	An i liyúme i lieo hilyane te, yámala: “Áse nahta!”
When they were going to lead him into the camp, Paul said to the army commander: “May I say something to you?” He said: “Can you speak Greek?	Íre tulyauvaneltes mir i estolie, Paulo quente i hosseturconna: “Ma lertan quete nat lyenna?” Quentes: “Ma istal quete Hellenya?
Are you really not the Egyptian who before these days caused an unrising and led the four thousand dagger men into the wilderness?”	Ma nanwave ual i Mirra ye nó auri sine tyarne amortie ar tulyane i sicilmor húmi canta mir i ravanda?”
Then Paul said: “I a Jewish man, born in Tarsus in Cilicia, a city not obscure. But I ask of you: Allow me to speak to the people!”	Tá Paulo quente: “Inye Yúra nér, nóna mi Tarsus Ciliciasse, osto lá nulla. Mal arcan lyello: Ánin lave quete i lienna!”
After he allowed that, Paul, standing on the steps, moved with his hand to the people. When a deep silence fell, he spoke to them in the Hebrew language, saying:	Apa láves ta, Paulo, tárala i tyellessen, léve máryanen i lien. Íre tumna quilde lantane, carampes téna i Heverya lambesse, quétala:
“Men, brothers and fathers, hear me speak for myself!”	“Neri, hánor ar atari, hlara ni quéta inyen!”
When they heard that he was speaking to them in the Hebrew language, they were still more silent, and he said:	Íre hlasselte i quétanes téna i Heverya lambesse, anelte en ambe quilde, ar eques:
“I am a Jew, born in Tarsus in Cilicia, but instructed in this city before the feet of Gamaliel in the tough manner of the Law of our fathers. I was burning for God like all among you on this day.	“Inye Yúra ná, nóna mi Tarsus Ciliciasse, mal peantana osto sinasse epe talu Amaliélo mí tarya lé i Şanyeo atarilvaron. Anen uryala Erun ve illi mici lé aure sinasse.
And I persecuted this Way to the death, binding and giving over into prison men and women alike,	Ar roitanen Tie sina i qualmenna, nútala ar antala olla mir mando neri ar nissi véla,
as also the chief priest and the entire council of elders can witness for me. From them I also got messages to the brothers in Damascus, and I was on my way to bring also that were there bound to Jerusalem for punishment.	ve yú i héra airimo ar i quanda combe amyáraron polir vetta nin. Ho té yú ñenten mentali i hánonnar Lamascusse, ar engen tienyasse talien yú i enger tasse nútine Yerúsalemenna paimen.
But on my journey, when I came near to Damascus, around the middle of the day, suddenly out of heaven a great line shone at me,	Mal lendanyasse, íre túlen hare Lamascusenna, os ende i aureo, rincanen et menello hoa cala caltane ninna,
and I fell to earth and heard a voice say to me: 'Saul, Saul, what is your reason for persecuting me?'	ar lantanen cemenna ar hlasse óma quéta ninna: 'Saul, Saul, mana castalya roitien ni?'
I answered: 'Who are you, Lord?' And he said to me: 'I am Jesus from Nazareth, whom you pursue.'	Hanquenten: 'Man nalye, Heru?' Ar quentes ninna: 'Nanye Yésus Nasaretello, ye elye roita.'
The men that were with me saw the light, but they did not hear the voice of who was speaking to me.	I neri i enger asinye cenner i cala, mal ualte hlasse i óma yeo quétane ninna.
Then I said: 'What am I to do, Lord?' The Lord said to me: 'Rise, go into Damascus, and there everything which is appointed to you to do will be told you.'	Tá quenten: 'Mana caruvan, Heru?' I Heru quente ninna: 'Á orta, mena mir Lamascus, ar tasse ilqua ya ná lyen sátina carien nauva nyárina lyen.'
But I could not see, because of the glory of that light, and being led by the hand by that were with me I came into Damascus.	Mal uan polde cene, i alcarnen sana calo, ar tulyaina i mánen lo i enger asinye túlen mir Lamascus.
But a man called Ananias, who was reverent according to the Law and had a good witness from all the Jews that dwelt there,	Mal nér estaina Ananías, ye náne ainocimya i Şanyenen ar sáme mára vettie ilye i Yúrallon i marner tasse,
came to me, and standing by me he said to me: “Saul, brother, see again!” And in the same hour I could again see, seeing him.	túle ninna, ar tárala ara ni quentes ninna: 'Saul, háno, cena ata!' Ar mí imya lúme polden ata cene, cénala se.
He said: 'The God of our fathers has chosen you to know his will and to see the Just One and to hear the voice of his mouth,	Quentes: 'Atarilvaron Aino icílie lyé istien indómerya ar cenien i Faila ar hlarien antoryo óma,
for you will be a witness to him to all men, about the things that you have seen and have heard.	an elye nauva vetto sen ilye atanin, pa i nati yar ecéniel ar ahláriel.
And now, how is it that you are waiting? Rise, be baptized and wash your sins away by calling on his name.	Ar sí, manen ná i hópal? Á orta, na sumbana ar sova úcarilyar oa yaliénen esseryanen.'
But after I returned to Jerusalem and prayed in the temple, I received a vision	Mal apa nanwennen Yerúsalemenna ar hyamne i cordasse, camnen maur
and saw him say to me: 'Be quick and go away from Jerusalem with urgency, for they will not receive your witness about me.'	ar cenne se quéta ninna: 'Na linta ar á auta Yerúsalemello hormenen, an ualte camuva vettielya pa ní.'
And I said: 'Lord, they know well that I threw into gaol and flogged in every synagogue that believe in you,	Ar inye quente: 'Heru, té istar mai in inye hante mir mando ar rípe mi ilya yomencoa i sáver lyesse,
and while the blood of Stephen your witness was being poured forth, I as well was standing near and thought well about what happened, and I was watching the cloaks of the people that killed him.'	ar lan Stefáno vettolyo serce náne etulyaina, yú inye tárane hare ar sanne mai pa ya martane, ar tíranen i collar i queniva i nacanter se.'
And yet he said to me: 'Go, for I will send you to far-off nations!'	Ananta quentes ninna: 'Mena, an lye-mentauvan haire nórennar!'
They listened until he said this word, and then they raised their voice, saying: “Take such a man away from earth, for he is not worthy of life!”	Lastaneltes tenna quentes quetta sina, ar tá ortanelte ómalta, quétala: “Á mapa taite nér oa cemello, an uas valda coiviéno!”
And since they shouted and shook their cloaks and threw dust into the air,	Ar pan yámelte ar paller collaltar ar hanter asto mir i vilya,
the army chief commanded that one was to bring him into the camp, in order to be examined by flogging, for him to know the reason why they shouted at him so.	i hosseturco canne i mo talumne se mir i estolie, náven céşina riptiénen, istieryan i casta yanen sie yámelte senna.
But after they stretched him out with straps for the flogging, Paul said to the centurion who was standing there: “May you flog a man who is Roman, and who is not judged?”	Mal apa lenuneltes lattalínen i riptien, Paulo quente i tuxanturenna ye tárane tasse: “Ma lertal ripta nér ye Rómea ná, ar ye ua námina?”
When the centurion heard that, he went to the army chief and told it to him, saying: “What are you going to do? For the man is a Roman!”	Íre i tuxantur hlasse ta, lendes i hosseturconna ar nyarne sa sen, quétala: “Mana caruval? An i nér Rómea ná!”
Therefore the army commander came to him and asked: “Tell me, are you Roman?” He said: “I am.”	Etta i hosseturco túle senna ar maquente: “Ánin nyare, ma nalye Rómea?” Eques: “Nanye.”
The army commander answered: “I traded to myself those rights with a great sum .” Paul said: “But I was born into them.”	I hosseturco hanquente: “Mancanen ninna lertier sine túra nonwenen.” Paulo quente: “Mal inye náne nóna mir tai.”
Therefore, in the same moment, the men that were going to examine him by torture stood away from him, and fear seized the army commander when he found that he was Roman, after he had bound him.	Etta, mí imya lú, i neri i ceşumner se ñwalmenen tarner oa sello, ar caure nampe i hosseturco íre hirnes in é anes Rómea, apa se-nuntelyanes.
On the following day he wished to know certainly what evil the Jews said that he had done. Therefore he released him from the chains and commanded the High Council that they were to assemble. Then he brought Paul and put him before them.	I hilyala auresse mernes ista tancave mana ulco i Yúrar quenter in acáries. Etta se-lehtanes i limilillon ar canne i Tára Comben i ocomumnelte. Tá talles Paulo ar panyane se epe te.
Paul, looking at the High Council, said: “Men, brothers, I have behaved before God with perfect conscience, until this day.”	Paulo, yétala i Tára Combe, quente: “Neri, hánor, elengien epe Eru mi ilvana immotuntie, tenna aure sina.”
Then Ananias the chief priest commanded that stood by him that they were to strike him on the mouth.	Tá Ananías i héra airimo canne in tarner ara se i petumneltes i antosse.
Then Paul said to him: “God will strike you, O whitened wall! Are you sitting to judge me by the Law, and at the same time you are breaking the Law by commanding that I shall be beaten?”	Tá Paulo quente senna: “Eru petuva lyé, a ramba ninquinta! Ma hámal ni-namien i Şanyenen, ar mí imya lú rácal i Şanye caniénen i nauvan pétina?”
 that stood by him said: “Are you speaking evil about the chief priest of God?”	I tarner ara se quenter: “Ma quétal ulco pa i héra airimo Eruo?”
And Paul said: “Brothers, I did not know that he is the chief priest. For is written: Do not speak evil of a chief of your people.”	Ar Paulo quente: “Hánor, uan sinte i náse i héra airimo. An ná técina: Áva quete ulco pa turco lielyo.”
He knew that among that were there, one part was of Sadducees and another of Pharisees, and therefore he cried in the High Council: “Men, brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees. Concerning the hope and the resurrection of dead I am being judged!”	Sintes in imíca i enger tasse, er ranta náne Sanducearon ar i hyana Farisaron, ar etta yámes i Tára Combesse: “Neri, hánor, inye Farisa ná, yondo Farisaron. Pa i estel ar i enortave qualinaiva nanye námaina!”
Since he said this thing, there was a dispute between Pharisees and Sadducees, and the multitude was split.	Pan quentes nat sina, enge cos imbi Farisar ar Sanducear, ar i liyúme náne şanca.
For Sadducces say that is not resurrection or angel or spirit, but the Pharisees openly believe all these things.	An Sanducear quetir i lá ea enortave hya vala hya faire, mal i Farisar pantave savir ilye nati sine.
Then there was great clamour, and some scribes that were of the party of the Pharisees arose and said in dispute: “We do not find evil in this man. What if a spirit has indeed spoken to him, or an angel?”	Tá enge hoa yalme, ar parmangolmoli i náner i ranto i Farisaron oronter ar quenter costesse: “Ualme hire ulco mi nér sina. Mana qui faire é equétie senna, hya vala?”
When a sharp strife arose, the army commander feared that they were going to pull him into pieces, and he commanded the soldiers that they were to go down to snatch him out of their midst and to bring him into the camp.	Íre aica cos oronte, i hosseturco runce ho i tucumnelte se mir rantali, ar cannes i ohtarin i menumnelte undu rapien se et endaltallo ar talien se mir i estolie.
But on the following day the Lord stood by him and said: “Courage! For as you have witnessed about that concern me in Jerusalem, so it is necessary for you to witness also in Rome.”	Mal i hilyala lómisse i Heru tarne ara se ar quente: “Huore! An ve evettiel pa yar apir ni Yerúsalemesse, sie mauya lyen vetta yú Rómasse.”
When day came, the Jews made a compact and cursed themselves if they ate or drank before killing Paul.	Íre aure túle, i Yúrar carner vére ar hunter inte qui mantelte hya suncelte nó nahtie Paulo.
The number of the men who together gave this oath was over forty.	I nóte i nerion i uo antaner vanda sina náne or canaquean.
They went to the chief priests and to the elders and said: “We have given an oath that we are not going to eat before we have killed Paul.	Lendelte i hére airimonnar ar i amyárannar ar quenter: “Ánielme vanda i ualme matuva nó anahtielme Paulo.
Therefore tell the army chief, you together with the High Council, that it is necessary for him to bring him down to you, as if you wish to make an inquiry to know more certainly the things that concern him. But before he shall come near, we shall be ready to kill him.”	Etta nyara i hosseturcon, elde as i Tára Combe, i mauya sen tala se undu lenna, ve qui merilde care centa istien ambe tancave i nati yar apir se. Mal nó tuluvas hare, elme nauvar manwe nahtien se.”
But when Paul's sister's son heard that they were lying hidden to kill him, he went to him, and when he came to the camp he told it to him.	Mal íre Paulo néşo yondo hlasse i caitumnelte nurtane nahtien se, lendes senna, ar íre túles i estolienna sa-nyarnes sen.
Therefore Paul called one among the centurions and said: 'Bring this young man to the army chief, for he has a thing to tell him.”	Etta Paulo yalde quén imíca i tuxanturi ar quente: “Á tala nessa nér sina i hosseturconna, an samis nat nyarien sen.”
Therefore this man took him and brought him to the army chief, and he said: “Paul, the bound man, called me and asked of me that I would bring this young man to you, for he has a thing to say to you.”	Etta nér sina nampe se ar talle se i hosseturconna, ar eques: “Paulo, i nútina nér, yalde ni ar arcane nillo i talumnen nessa nér sina lyenna, an samis nat quetien lyen.”
The army chief took his hand and went away to a private place and asked: “What do you have to tell me?”	I hosseturco nampe márya ar lende oa véra nómenna ar maquente: “Mana samil nyarien ninna?”
He said: “The Jews together have made a plan that they will ask that tomorrow you will bring Paul down to the High Council, as if they want to learn more certainly what he has done.	Hé quente: “I Yúrar uo acárier pano in arcuvalte in enwa taluval Paulo undu i Tára Combenna, ve qui merilte pare ambe tancave mana acáries.
But you do not allow them to induce you into doing that, for more than forty men among them are lying hidden waiting for him, and they have bound themselves with an oath that they will not eat or drink before they have killed him, and now they are ready, waiting for your assent.”	Mal elye áva lave tien şahta lye mir carie ta, an ambe lá canaquean neri mici te cáyar nurtane hópala se, ar unútielte inte vandanen in ualte matuva hya sucuva nó anahtieltes, ar sí nalte manwe, hópala şáquetielyan.”
Then the army chief went away from the young man after commanding him: “Do not say to anyone that you have revealed these things to me.”	Tá i hosseturco oante i nessa nerello apa canie sen: “Áva quete aiquenna i ápantiel nati sine nin.”
And he called two of the centurions and said: “Prepare two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, with seventy horsemen and two hundred men that carry spears, at the third hour of the night.	Ar yaldes atta i tuxanturion ar quente: “Á manwa ohtari tuxa atta menien Césareanna, as roqueni otoquean ar neri tuxa atta i colir hatili, i neldea lúmesse i lómio.
Furthermore, bring some horses. Thus, letting Paul ride, you will bring him in safety to Felix the governor.”	Ente, á tala roccoli. Sie, lávala Paulon norta, taluvaltes mi varnasse Felix i nórecánonna.”
And he wrote a message having these words:	Ar tences menta arwa sine quettaron:
“Claudius Lysias to the mighty governor, Felix: Greetings! 	“Claurio Lisias i taura nórecánonna, Felix: Hara máriesse!
This man was seized by the Jews and was near to being slain by them, but I fell upon them with the soldiers and saved him, since I learnt that he was a Roman.	Nér sina náne mapana lo i Yúrar ar náne hare návenna nahtana lo te, mal lantanen téna as i ohtari ar se-rehtane, pan parnen in náse Rómea.
And wishing to know the reason of their complaint against him, I brought him down into their High Council.	Ar merila ista i casta nurrelto ana se, tallenyes undu mir Tára Combelta.
I found that complaints about disputes touching on their Law are brought against him, but about nothing worthy of death or of chains.	Hirnen i nurreli pa costeli apila Şanyelta nar talane senna, mal pa munta valda qualmeo hya limilion.
But since a plan against this man has been revealed to me, I sent him to you without waiting, and I command that have complaints about him that they must speak against him before you.”	Man pan pano ana nér sina anaie apantana nin, mentanenyes lyenna pen hopie, ar canin i samir nurreli pa se i mauya tien quete ana se epe lyé.”
Therefore these soldiers took Paul, as was commanded to them, and brought him at night to Antipatris.	Etta ohtari sine namper Paulo, ve náne tien cánina, ar taller se lómisse Antipatrisenna.
On the following day they let the horsemen go with him still, and returned to the camp.	I hilyala auresse lávelte i roquenin lelya óse en, ar nanwenner i estolienna.
The horsemen went into Caesarea and gave the message to the governor, and put also Paul before him.	I roqueni lender mir Césarea ar antane i menta i nórecánon, ar panyanelte yú Paulo epe se.
After he read the letter he asked about what region he came from, and learnt that he was from Cilicia.	Apa cendanes i menta maquentes pa mana ménallo hé túle, ar parne i hé náne Ciliciallo.
He said: “I will hear you, when the people that have complaints about you shall arive also.” And he commanded that one was to keep him in gaol in the palace of Herod.	Eques: “Hlaruvan lye, íre i queni i samir nurreli pa lyé yú tuluvar.” Ar cannes i mo hepumne se mandosse mí túrion Herolwa.
After five days Ananias the chief priest came down with some elders and an orator whose name was Tertulllus, and they spoke evil about Paul.	Apa rí lempe Ananías i héra airimo túle undu as amyárali ar carpando yeo esse náne Tertullo, ar quentelte ulco pa Paulo.
When he was called, Tertullus began to speak against him, saying: “Great peace we have through you, and reforms occur in this nation by your foresight!	Íre anes yálina, Tertullo yestane carpa ana se, quétala: “Túra raine samilme ter lyé, ar envinyatiéli martar nóre sinasse apacenelyanen!
In all times and places, mighty Felix, we receive those with greatest thanks.	Mi ilye lúmi ar nómi, taura Felix, camilme tai antúra hantalénen.
But so as not to take more of your time, I ask of you that you will listen to us briefly, gracious as you are.	Mal lá mapien amba lúmelyo, arcan lyenna i me-lastuval şintave, raina ve nalye.
For we have found that this man is a pestilence, causing uprisings among all the Jews through the entire world, and he is prominent in the sect of the Nazarenes,	An ihírielme i nér sina qolúvie ná, tyarila amortiéli imíca ilye i Yúrar ter i quanda ambar, ar náse minda mí heren i Nasaryaron,
a person who also tried to defile the temple, and whom we seized. We wanted to judge him by our Law,	quén ye yú néve vahta i corda, ar ye nampelme. Mernelme name se Şanyelmanen,
but Lysias the army chief came and took him out of our hands by violence and brought him away.	mal Lísias i hosseturco túle ar se-nampe et málmalto ormenen ar se-talle oa.
From him it is possible for you, by examining him, to learn about all the crimes that we say he has done.”	Ho hé ece elyen, ceşiénen hé, pare pa ilye i ongwi yar quetilme in acáries.”
The Jews were his supporters and said that so it was.	I Yúrar náner astarindoryar ar quenter i sie enge.
And Paul, when the governor with a gesture of his head allowed him to talk, answered:“Knowing well that this nation has had you as judge for many years, I speak freely for myself.	Ar Paulo, íre i nórecáno hwermenen caryo láve sen carpa, hanquente:“Istala mai i nóre sina asámie lye ve námo ter rimbe loali, quetin lérave inyen.
It is possible for you to learn that only twelve days ago I went up to worship in Jerusalem.	Ece lyen pare i rie auri yunque yá lenden ama tyerien Yerúsalemesse.
They did not find me in the temple having a dispute with anyone or causing an uprising, in the synagogues or in the city.	Ualte hire ni i cordasse arwa costo as aiquen hya tyárala amortie, i yomencoassen hya i ostosse.
Furthermore, it is not possible for them to demonstrate that I have done the crimes of which they now speak against me.	Ente, ua ece tien tana in acárien i ongwi pa yar sí carpalte ana ni.
But this thing I openly tell you: By the Way that they call a 'sect', by it I serve God, believing all the matters that are of the Law and written in the Prophets.	Mal nat sina pantave nyarin lyen: I Tienen ya estalte 'heren', sánen veuyan Eru, savila ilye i nattor i nar i Şanyeo ar técine mí Erutercánor.
And I have hope to God, the same hope that also these men have: will be a resurrection of just ones and injust ones alike.	Ar samin estel Erunna, i imya estel ya yú neri sine samir: Euva enortave failaiva ar úfailaiva véla.
Therefore my goal is that I will always have a clean conscience towards God and men.	Etta ennenya ná in inye illume samuva poica immotuntie Erunna ar atannar.
After some years passed, I came to bring gifts of mercy to my nation, and to sacrifice.	Apa loali váner, túlen talien annali oraviéva nórenyanna, ar yacien.
While I was doing these things, they found me cleansed in the temple, but was not crowd or uprising. But were there some Jews from Asia,	Lan cáranen nati sine, hirnelte ni poitana i cordasse, mal lá enge şanga hya amortie. Mal enger tasse Yúrali Asiallo,
and was better if they came before you to speak about my crimes, if they have a complaint against me.	ar náne arya qui té túler epe lye quetien pa ongwenyar, qui samilte nur ninna.
Or let these men say what evil they found in me when I stood before the High Council,	Hya lava sine nerin quete mana ulco hirnelte nisse íre tarnen epe i Tára Combe,
if it was not this single saying that I cried when I stood before them: 'Concerning the resurrection of dead I am being judged before you today!'	qui únes sina erya quetie ya yámen íre tarnen epe te: 'Pa i enortave qualinaiva nanye námaina epe le síra!'
But Felix, knowing well the matters that concerned the Way, turned the men away and said: “When Lysias the army chief shall come down, I will make my choices about the matters that concern you.”	Mal Felix, istala mai i nattor yar amper i Tie, querner i neri oa ar quente: “Íre Lisias i hosseturco tuluva undu, caruvan cilmenyar pa i nattor yar apir lye.”
And he commanded the centurion to keep the man in a gentle manner, and he was not going to stop anyone among his own from serving him.	Ar cannes i tuxanturen hepe i nér mi moica lé, ar uas pustumne aiquen mici véraryar veviello se.
After some days Felix came with Drusilla his wife, who was Jewish, and he brought Paul and listened to him about the faith in Christ Jesus.	Apa réli Felix túle as Rusilla verirya, ye náne Yúra, ar talles Paulo ar lastane senna pa i savie mi Hristo Yésus.
But when he talked about justice and self-control and the coming judgement, Felix was scared and answered: “For this time go away, but when I have an opportunity, I will summon you again.”	Mal íre carampes pa failie ar immoturie ar i tulila namie, Felix náne ruhtana ar hanquente: “Lú sinan á auta, mal íre samin ecie, lye-tultuvan ata.”
But at the same time he had the hope that he would receive money from Paul. Therefore he summoned him that more frequently, and he talked with him.	Mal mi imya lú sámes i estel i camumnes telpe Paulollo. Etta se-tultanes ta ambe rimbave, ar carampes óse.
But after two years passed, Felix was followed as governor by Porcius Festus, and since Felix wanted to have the grace of the Jews, he left Paul bound.	Mal apa loa atta vánet, Felix náne hilyana ve nórecáno lo Porcio Festo, ar pan Felix merne same i Yúraron lisse, hehtanes Paulo nútina.
Therefore Festus, when he received the power over the region , after three days went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea,	Etta Festo, íre camnes i túre or i ména, apa rí nelde lende ama Yerúsalemenna Césareallo,
and the chief priests and the prominent ones of the Jews told him their complaints against Paul. Then they asked Festus,	ar i hére airimor ar i mindar i Yúraron nyarne sen nurriltar Paulonna. Tá arcanelte Festonna,
seeking a favor against Paul, that he would send him to Jerusalem. For they were going to lie hidden, to kill him on the road.	cestala lis ana Paulo, i mentauvas hé Yerúsalemenna. An caitumnelte nurtane, nahtien hé i mallesse.
But Festus answered that Paul was going to remain kept in Caesarea, and that he himself would return there soon.	Mal Festo hanquente i Paulo lemyuuva hépina Césareasse, ar in isse nanwenuva tar ron.
He said: “Therefore may the mighty among you come down to speak of his crimes, if there is anything irregular about him.”	Eques: “Etta nai i taurar mici le tuluvar undu quetien pa ongweryar, qui ea aiqua úşanya pa se.”
Thus, after remaining with them for no more than eight or ten days, he went down to Caesarea, and the following day he sat down on the judgement seat and commanded that one was to bring Paul.	Sie, apa lemie aselte ter rí lá or tolto hya quean, ununtes Césareanna, ar i hilyala auresse hamunes i námosondonna ar canne i mo taluva Paulo.
When he came, the Jews that had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, saying that he had done numerous and weighty crimes, but it was not possible for them to show that that was true.	Íre túles, i Yúrar i náner tulinwe undu Yerúsalemello tarner os se, quétala in acáries rimbe ar lunge ongweli, mal lá ence ten tana i ta nanwa né.
But Paul said, defending himself: “Against the Law or against the Jews or against the High King alike I have not done a single sin.”	Mal Paulo quente, varyala inse: “Ana i Şanye hya ana i Yúrar hya ana i Ingaran véla uan acárie erya úcare.”
Festus, who wanted to receive the good will of the Jews, answered Paul: “Do you want to go up to Jerusalem to be judged there before me concerning these matters?”	Festo, ye merne came i mára nirme i Yúraron, hanquente Paulonna: “Ma meril lelya ama Yerúsalemenna náven námina tasse epe ni pa nattor sine?”
But Paul said: “I am standing before the judgement seat of the High King, where it is necessary for me to be judged. I have done nothing evil against the Jews, as also you well know.	Mal eque Paulo: “Táran epe i námosonda i Ingaranwa, yasse mauya nin náve námina. Acárien munta ulca ana i Yúrar, ve yú elye mai ista.
If I have indeed done a crime and I am worthy of death, I do not ask to escape from death, but if I have not done a single one of the crimes which they say I have done, nobody may give me into their hand. I put my case before the High King.”	Qui é acárien ongwe ar nanye valda qualmeo, uan arca uşe qualmello, mal qui uan acárie erya i ongwion yar quetilte acárien, úquen lerta anta ni mir málta. Panyan nattonya epe i Ingaran.”
After speaking with the council, Festus answered: “Before the High King you have put your case; to the High King you will go.”	Apa quetie as i combe, Festo hanquente: “Epe i Ingaran apánel nattolya, i Ingaranna menuval.”
After some days passed, Agrippa the king and Bernice came to Caesarea to greet Festus.	Apa réli váner, Árippa i aran yo Vernice túlet Césareanna suilien Festo.
After they were there for a number of days, Festus told the king about the matters that concerned Paul, saying:“ is a man left bound by Felix,	Apa anette tasse ter nóte rélion, Festo nyarne i aranen pa i nattor yar amper Paulo, quétala:“Ea nér hehtana nútina lo Felix,
and when I was in Jerusalem the chief priests and the elders of the Jews told me about him, requesting that I would judge him as having guilt.	ar íre anen Yerúsalemesse i hére airimor ar i amyárar i Yúraron nyarner ni pa se, arcala i namuvan se ve arwa cámo.
But I answered them that among Romans it is not custom to give anyone over, before the person of whom others say that he had committed crimes meets those that speak against him face to face, and he has the opportunity to speak for himself concerning the complaint.	Mal hanquenten téna i mici Rómear ua haime anta aiquen olla, nó i quén pa ye exeli quetir in acáries ongweli vele i quetir ana se cendello cendelenna, ar ece sen quete insen pa i nur.
Therefore, when they assembled here, without halting I sat down on the judgement seat and commanded that one was to bring the man.	Etta, íre ocomnelte sisse, pen hautie hamunen i námosondasse ar canne i mo taluva i nér.
Standing before me, those who say that he has committed crimes did not talk about the wicked things that I supposed concerning him.	Tárala epe ni, i quetir in acáries ongweli uar carampe pa i olce nati yar inye intyane pa se.
They had some quarrels with him about their own worship of the deity, and about a person called Jesus, who is dead, but who Paul said is alive.	Sámelte costeli óse pa véra tyerielta i ainova, ar pa quén estaina Yésus, ye qualina ná, mal ye Paulo quente ná coirea.
Not knowing what I was going to do about the quarrel about these things, I asked if he wanted to go to Jerusalem, there to be judged concerning these matters.	Lá istala mana carumnen pa i cos sine nation, maquenten qui mernes lelya Yerúsalemenna, tasse náven námina pa nattor sine.
But when Paul asked to be kept for the judgment of His Majesty, I commanded that he is to be kept until I shall send him to the High King.”	Mal íre Paulo arcane náve hépina i námien Meletyaryo, cannen i nauvas hépina tenna mentauvan se i Ingaranna.”
Then Agrippa said to Festus: “I as well wish to hear the man.” He answered: “Tomorrow you will hear him.”	Tá Árippa quente Festonna: “Yu inye mere hlare i nér.” Hanquentes: “Enwa hlaruvalyes.”
Therefore, on the following day, Agrippa and Bernice came with great glory and went into the audience chamber with army chiefs and some prominent men from the city, and when Festus commanded, Paul was brought.	Etta, i hilyala auresse, Árippa yo Vernice túlet mi túra alcar ar lendet mir i şambe veliéva as hosseturcoli ar minde nelli i ostollo, ar íre Festo canne, Paulo náne talana.
And Festus said: “King Agrippa and you that are with us, you behold this man concerning whom the entire multitude of Jews together have made pention to me, in Jerusalemn and here alike, crying that he is not worthy of life anymore.	Ar Festo quente: “Aran Árippa ar elde illi i ear aselme, yétalde nér sina pa ye i quanda liyúme Yúraron uo acárie arcande nin, Yerúsalemesse ar sisse véla, yámala i uas valda coiviéno ambe.
But I perceived that he has done nothing worthy of death. Therefore, when this man put his case before his Majesty, I judged that I would send him.	Mal túnen in acáries munta valda qualmeo. Etta, íre nér sina panyane nattorya epe Meletyarya, namnen i mentauvan se.
But concerning him I have nothing certain to write to my lord. Therefore I brought him out before you, and above all before you, King Agrippa: After the interrogation I will know what I am to write.	Mal pa sé samin munta tanca tecien herunyanna. Etta ettallenyes epe lé, ar or illi epe elye, Aran Árippa: Apa i ceşie istuvan mana tecuvan.
For I think it is senseless if I send a bound person but fail to indicate the complaints against him.	An sanan i úhanda ná qui mentan nútina quén mal loita tea i nurri senna.
Agrippa said to Paul: “You may speak.” Then Paul reached out with his hand and spoke, defending himself:	Árippa quente Paulonna: “Lertal quete.” Tá Paulo rahtane máryanen ar quente, varyala inse:
“Concerning all the crimes that the Jews say that I have done, King Agrippa, I count myself happy that before you I speak for myself today,	“Pa ilye i ongwi yar i Yúrar quetir i acárien, Aran Árippa, nótan inse valima in epe elye síra quetin insen,
above all for the reason that you know all the customs and strifes of among Jews. Therefore I ask that you will hear me with patience.	or ilqua i castanen in istal mai ilye i haimi ar costi mici Yúrar. Etta arcan i ni-hlaruval cólenen.
My manner of living from my youth – how I behaved from the beginning in my nation and in Jerusalem – is known by all Jews	Lénya coiviéva néşenyallo – manen lenganen i yestallo nórenyasse ar mi Yerúsalem – ná sinwa lo ilye Yúrar
that have known me beforehand, if they want to witness. They know that my life as a Pharisee was by the harshest order of our worship.	i isintier ni nóvo, qui merilte vetta. Istalte i coivienya ve Farisa náne i amnaraca herennen tyerielmo.
And yet now, by reason of the promise given to our fathers, I am standing here to be judged.	Ananta sí, castanen i vando antana atarilmain, táran náven námina.
Our twelve tribes have the hope that they will see the promise made true if they serve him with vigour through night and day. Concerning this hope the Jews say that I have committed crimes, o King.	Nosselmar yunque samir i estel i cenuvalte i vanda carna nanwa qui veuyalte se veassenen ter lóme yo aure. Pa estel sina i Yúrar quetir i acárien ongweli, a Aran.
What is your reason for judging that one cannot believe that God rises dead?	Mana castalda namien i mo ua pole save in Eru orta qualinar?
I indeed thought that it was necessary for me to stand against the name of Jesus Christ from Nazareth in numerous manners,	Inye é sanne i mauyane nin tare ana i esse Yésus Hristova Násaretello mi rimbe léli,
as I also did in Jerusalem, and numerous ones among the holy ones I put in goals after I received power from the chief priests, and when one spoke about killing them, I gave my vote againat them.	ve yú carnen Yerúsalemesse, ar rimbali i airion panyanen mandossen apa camnen túre i hére airimollon, ar íre mo quente pa nahtie te, illume antanen ómanya ana te.
Furthermore, I frequently punished them in all synagogues and compelled them to blaspheme, and being extremely angry against them I also pursued them into foreign cities.	Ente, rimbave paimetánen te ilye yomencoassen ar mauyane te naiquete, an nála ita rúşea ana te yú roitanenyet mir ettelie ostor.
While I was doing these things – on a journey to Damascus, after receiving power and permission from the chief priests –	Lan cáranen nati sine – mi lenda Lamascusenna, apa camie túre ar lavie i hére airimollon –
in the midst of the day, still on the road, I saw a light beyond the glory of the sun which shone around me and around who travelled with me.	endesse i aureo, en i mallesse, cennen cala han Anaro alcar ya caltane os ni ar os i lender asinye.
And after all among us fell to the ground I heard a voice say to me in the Hebrew language: 'Saul, Saul, what is your reason for pursuing me? Striking against the spikes will be painful for you.'	Ar apa illi mici me lantaner i talamenna hlassen óma quéta ninna i Heverya lambesse: 'Saul, Saul, mana castalya roitien ni? Petie ana i tildi nauva naica lyen.'
But I said: 'Who are you, Lord?' And the Lord said: 'I Jesus, whom you pursue.	Mal quenten: 'Man nalye, Heru?' Ar i Heru quente: 'Inye Yésus, ye roital.
And yet rise and stand on your feet . For for this purpose I have shown myself to you, to choose you as a servant and a witness both of that you have seen and of that I shall cause you to see, concerning me.	Ananta á orta ar tara talulyatse. An sina ennen atánienyexe lyen, lye-cilien ve núro ar vetto yúyo yaron ecéniel ar yaron tyaruvan lyen cene, pa ni.
I deliver you out of this people and from the nations, to which I send you	Etelehtan lye et lie sinallo ar i nórellon, yannar lye-mentan
to open their eyes , in order to turn them from darkness to light and from Satan's power to God, for them to receive forgiveness of sins and a part as heirs among who are hallowed by believing in me.'	pantien hendultat, te-querien morniello calanna ar Sátano túrello Erunna, camieltan apsenie úcariva ar ranta ve aryoni imíca i nar airinte saviénen nisse.'
Therfore, king Agrippa, I did not fail to heed the vision from heaven,	Etta, aran Árippa, uan loitane cime i maur menello,
but firstly to that are in Damascus and then to that are in Jerusalem and the entire land surrounding Judea I brought the message that it is necessary for them to find repentance and turn themselves to God, by doing deeds worthy of repentance.	mal minyave innar ear Lamascusse ar tá innar ear mi Yerúsalem ar i quanda nóre pelila Yúrea tallen i menta i mauya tien hire inwis ar quere inte Erunna, cariénen cardar valde inwisten.
Concerning these things some Jews seized me in the temple and tried to kill me.	Pa nati sine Yúrali ni-namper i cordasse ar néver nahta ni.
But since I was being helped by God I have stood witnessing to small and to great, but saying nothing except that the Prophets and Moses alike said were going to happen:	Mal pan anen manyana lo Eru atárien vettala pityan yo túran, mal quétala munta hequa yar i Erutercánor ar Móses véla quenter martumner:
The Christ was going to suffer, and as the first being raised from dead, he was going to make light known to this people and to the nations alike.»	I Hristo perperumne, ar ve i minya nála ortana qualinallon, carumnes cala sinwa lie sinan ar i nórin véla.»
When he said these things defending himself, Festus said in a mighty voice: “You are out of your mind, Paul! Great learning is undoing your mind!”	Íre quentes nati sine varyala inse, Festo quente taura ómanen: “Nalye sámalyo ettesse, Paulo! Túra ñolme nancára sámalya!”
But Paul said: “I am not out of my mind, mighty Festus, but I speak sayings of truth and soundness of mind.	Mal Paulo quente: “Uan sámanyo ettesse, taura Festo, mal quetin quetiéli nanwiéva ar máleva sámo.
For the king understands these things, he to whom I am speaking with boldness, for I am certain that nothing of this escapes his notice, for this thing has not been done in a corner.	An i aran hanya nati sine, isse yenna quétan veriénen, an nanye tanca i munta sino uşe tuntierya, an nat sina ua anaie carna vincasse.
Do you, King Agrippa, believe in the Prophets? I know that you believe.”	Ma elye, Aran Árippa, save i Erutercánossen? Istan i savil.”
But Agrippa said to Paul: “In a short time you would talk me into becoming a Christian.”	Mal Árippa quente Paulonna: “Mi şinta lúme quetumnel ni mir ole Hristondur.”
Then Paul said: “I can wish to God that soon or later, not just you but also all that are hearing me today will become such as I am, though without these chains.”	Tá Paulo quente: “Ece nin mere Erunna i ronhya ambe telwave, lá rie elye mal yú illi i hlárar ni síra oluvar taiti ve inye ná, ómu pen limili sine.”
But the king arose, and so did the the governor and Bernice and the men that had sat with them.	Ar i aran oronte, ar sie carner i nórecáno ar Vernice ar i neri i hamnelyaner aselte.
But when they went away they talked one with the other, saying: “This man does nothing worthy of death or of chains.”	Mal íre lendelte oa carampelte quén as i exe, quétala: “Nér sina care munta valda qualmeo hya limilion.”
Furthermore, Agrippa said to Festus: “It was possible to release this man if he did not put his case before the High King.”	Ente, Árippa quente Festonna: “Ence lehta nér sina au uas panyane nattorya epe i Ingaran.”
After the choice was made that we were going to sail to Italy , they gave Paul and some other bound men over to a centurion called Julius, of the army of His Majesty.	Apa i cilme náne carna i cirumnelme Italianna, antanelte Paulo ar hyane nútine nelli olla tuxanturen estaina Yúlio, i hosseo i Meletyaryo.
We went into a ship from Adramyttium which was going to sail from the coast of Asia. We sailed away, and with us was Aristarchus the Macedonian, from Thessalonica.	Lendelme mir cirya ho Arramittium ya cirumne i nómennar i falasseo Ásio. Cirnelme oa, ar aselme enge Aristarco i Maceronya, Şessalonicallo.
And on the following day we reached Sidon , and Julius showed kindness to Paul and allowed him to go to his friends and receive their comfort.	Ar i hilyala auresse rahtanelme Síronna, ar Yúlio tanne lisse Paulon ar láve sen lelya nilmoryannar ar came aşielta.
And we sailed away from there and went under the shelter of Cyprus, since the winds were against us.	Ar cirnelme oa talo ar lender nu i cauma Ciprusso, pan i súri náner ana me.
And after we sailed through the open sea by Cilicia and Pamphylia we came to port in Myra in Lycia.	Ar apa cirnelme ter i eare ara Cilicia ar Pamfilia túlelme hópanna Mírasse mi Licia.
But the centurion found a ship from Alexandria that was going to sail to Italy, and he commanded us to go into that.	Mal i tuxantur hirne cirya Alexandriallo ya cirumne Italianna, ar cannes men lelya mir ta.
After sailing slowly for a sufficient number of days and coming to Cnidus with difficulty, since we had the wind in our face, we sailed under the shelter of Crete at Salmone,	Apa cirie lencave ter fárea nóte aurion ar tulie Cnirusenna urdave, pan sámelme i súre cendelemasse, cirnelme nu i cauma Créteo Salmonesse,
and sailing difficultly by the shore we came to a place called Fair Havens, near to the city Lasea.	ar círala urdave ara i falasse túlelme nómenna estaina Vanime Hópar, hare i ostonna Laséa.
A long time was gone, and now was danger in traveling on sea, for even the Fast was past. Therefore Paul spoke about what he thought was the best,	Anda lúme náne vanwa, ar sí enge raxe mi lelie earesse, an yando i Lamate vanwa né. Etta Paulo quente pa ya sannes náne i arya,
saying to them: “Men, I perceive that sailing will bring destruction, and much will be lost to you, not concerning the goods and the ship alone, but also concerning our lives.”	quétala téna: “Neri, tuntan i cirie taluva nancarie, ar olya nauva vanwa ven, lá pa i armar ar i cirya erinque, mal yú pa cuilelvar.”
But the centurion heeded the captain and the man who owned the ship more than the things that Paul said.	Mal i tuxantur cimne i hesto ar i nér ye haryane i cirya ambe lá i nati yar Paulo quente.
The haven was not good for remaining through the winter, and therefore the greater number thought that it was better to sail away from there, if in this or that manner it was possible for them to reach as far as Phoenix and remain there through the winter. That is a haven of Crete that is open towards the north-east and south-east.	I hópa úne mára termarien ter i hríve, ar etta i amarimbar sanner i náne arya cirie oa talo, qui mi tana hya sina lé ence tien rahta tenna Fénix ar lemya tasse ter i hríve. Ta ná hópa Créteo ya ná panta forrómenna ar hyarrómenna.
Furthermore, when the wind from the south blew they thought that their goal was in their reach, and they pulled up the anchor and sailed along the coast of Crete.	Ente, íre i súre hyarmello vávane sannelte in ennelta enge rahtieltasse, ar tuncelte ama i ciryampa ar cirner ara Créteo falasse.
But after not a long time a stormwind, that which is called Euroaquilo, came rushing from the island.	Mal apa lá anda lúme alaco, ta ya estaina Euroaquilo ná, túle rimpa i tollallo.
The ship was seized and could not keep its prow against the wind, and we stopped trying to control it and were carried .	I cirya náne mapaina ar ua polle hepe langorya i súrinna, ar pustanelme neve turitas ar náner cóline.
When we came into the shelter of a small island called Cauda, we could with difficulty save the boat .	Íre túlelme mir i cauma pitya tollo estaina Caura, poldelme urdiénen rehta i lunte.
After we lifted it into the ship we used the emergency equipment and bound around the ship with ropes. Our fear was that the ship was going to hit the hidden rocks in Syrte; therefore they took down the front sail and were carried .	Apa ortanelmes mir i cirya yuhtanelte i mauresorastar ar nunter os i cirya rappalínen. Caurelma náne in i cirya petumne i nurtane ondor Sirtesse; etta nampelte undu i pota-velunte ar náner cóline.
But the storm lay extremely heavy upon us, and on the following day they threw the goods into the sea,	Mal i raumo ita lumnane men, ar i hilyala auresse hantelte i armar mir i ear,
and on the third day with their own hands they threw the equipment of the ship into the sea.	ar i neldea auresse hantelte vére máltanten i ciryo sorastar mir i ear.
When we did not see the Sun or stars for many days, and no small storm lay upon us, all hope of our salvation faded.	Íre ualme cenne Anar hya tinwi rimbe rélissen, ar lá pitya raumo caine menna, firne ilya estel rehtielmo.
And after a long time when they did not eat food, Paul arose among them and said: “Men, you did better if you listened to me, not going away from Crete, but escaping this destruction and loss.	Ar apa anda lúme yasse ualte mante matta Paulo oronte mici te ar quente: “Neri, carnelde arya au lastanelde ni, lá autala Crétello, mal úşala sina nancarie ar úhepie.
But now I exhort you: Have courage, for is not a single person among you who will be lost! Only the ship will be.	Mal sí hortan le: Sama huore, an lá ea erya quén imíca le ye nauva vanwa! Rie i cirya nauva.
For in this night stood beforeme an angel of the God whose servant I am, and whom I worship.	An mi lóme sina tarne epe ni vala Eruo yeo núro nanye, ar ye tyerin.
He said: 'Do not fear, Paul! It is necessary for you to stand before the High King, and behold! God has given you all that are sailing with you.'	Eques: 'Áva ruce, Paulo! Mauya len tare epe i Ingaran, ar yé! Eru ánie len illi i círar aselye.'
Therefore have courage, men, for I believe what God said , that the matter will be just as has been told me.	Etta sama huore, neri, an savin Eruo quetie, in i natto nauva aqua ve anaie nyárina nin.
But we will be thrown onto the beach of some island.”	Mal nauvalme hátine er tollo hrestanna”
When the fourteenth night fell and we were thrown hither and thirther on the Sea of Adria, in the middle of the night the sailors supposed that they were coming near to some land.	Íre i canaquea lóme lantane ar anelme hátaine sir ar tar Arria-earesse, endesse i lómio i ciryamor intyaner i anelte túlala hare er norenna.
And they measured how deep the sea was and found that it was twenty fathoms. They went a short way forward and measured again, and they found fifteen fathoms.	Ar lestanelte manen núra i ear náne ar hirner i anes rangwi yúquean. Lendelte şinta tie ompa ar lestaner ata, ar hirnelte rangwi lepenque.
And since we feared that perhaps we were going to strike the rocks, they threw into the sea four anchors from the rear of the ship and longed for the coming of day.	Ar pan runcelme i cé petumnelme i ondor, hantelte mir i ear ciryampar canta i pontillo i ciryo ar milyaner tulesse aureo.
But the sailors, seeking to escape from the ship, put the boat on the sea, saying that they were going to hang anchors from the prow.	Mal i ciryamor, cestala uşe i ciryallo, panyaner i lunte i earesse, quétala i lingumnelte ciryampali i langollo.
Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers: “If these men do not remain on the ship, it is not possible for you to be saved!”	Paulo quente i tuxanturenna ar i ohtarinnar: “Qui neri sine uar lemya i ciryasse, ua ece len náve rehtane!”
Then the soldiers cut the ropes of the boat and let it float way.	Tá i ohtari cirner i rappar i lunteo ar láver san lutta oa.
When day was near, Paul encouraged all that they were to eat, saying: “Today is the fourteenth day when you are waiting without food, for you have eaten nothing.	Íre aure hare né, Paulo hortane illi i matumnelte, quétala: “Síra ná i canaquea ré yasse hópalde ú matto, an amátielde munta.
Therefore I ask of you that you will eat food, for that will help your rescue. For a single hair on the head of anyone among you will not be lost.”	Etta arcan lello i matuvalde matta an ta manyuva rehtielda. An erya finde i caro aiqueno mici le lá nauva vanwa.”
After saying these words he took a bread, gave thanks to God before them all, and broke it and began to eat.	Apa quetie quettar sine nampes massa, antane hantale Erun epe te illi, ar sa-rance ar yestane mate.
Then they had joy, and they as well ate food.	Tá sámelte alasse, ar yú té manter matta.
Our total number on the ship was two hundred and seventy-six.	Quanda nótelma i ciryasse náne enque otoquean ar tuxa atta.
After eating the food that we wanted, we made the ship less heavy by throwing the grain into the sea.	Apa matie i matta ya mernelte, carnelte i cirya mis lunga hatiénen i ore mir i ear.
When day came, they did not know the land, but they saw a bay where was a beach, and they wanted to bring the ship thither, if it was possible for them.	Íre aure túle, ualte sinte i nórie, mal cennelte londe yasse enge hresta, ar mernelte tala i cirya tar, qui ence tien.
Therefore they cut away the anchors and let them fall into the sea, and at the same time they loosened the lashes of the rudder. Then they raised the forward sail towards the wind and went against the beach.	Etta aucirnelte i ciryampar ar láver tain lanta mir i ear, ar mí imya lú lehtanelte i lattar i tullo. Tá ortanelte i pota-velunte i súrinna ar lender ana i hresta.
When they fell upon a place where the sea struck from both directions, they brought the ship onto ground. The prow was fixed and could not move, but the back of the ship was broken into pieces by the violence of the sea.	Íre lantanelte nómenna yanna ear pente yúyo tiello, tallelte i cirya talamenna. I lango náne tanca ar ua polde leve, mal i ciryo ponte náne rácina mir rantar ormenen i earo.
Then the soldiers wanted to kill the bound men, to stop anyone from escaping by swimming away.	Tá i ohtari merner nahta i nútine neri, pustien aiquen uşiello lutiénen oa.
But the centurion wished to bring Paul to safety and stopped them from doing what they wanted. And he commanded those that knew to swim that they were to jump into the sea, in order to reach to land first.	Mal i tuxantur merne tala Paulo varnassenna ar pustaner te cariello ya mernelte. Ar cannes in sinter lute i capumnelte mir ear, rahtien norenna minyave.
The others followed, some on planks, some on things from the ship. And thus all were brought safely to land.	I exi hilyaner, ennoli panolissen, ennoli natalissen i ciryallo. Ar sie illi náner talane varnave norenna.
After we reached safety we learnt that the name of the island was Melite .	Apa rahtanelme varnassenna parnelme in i tollo esse náne Melite.
And the people there, who spoke a language that we did not understand, behaved towards us with kindness beyond what is usual, for they kindled a fire and received us all, by reason of the rain that fell, and of the cold.	Ar i queni tasse, i quenter lambe ya ualme hanyane, lenganer menna lissenen han ya senwa ná, an nartanelte ruine ar camner me illi, castanen i ulo ya lantane, ar i ringiéno.
But when Paul collected a bunch of sticks and put them on the fire, a snake came out because of the heat and fastened itself to his hand.	Mal íre Paulo hostane loxe olwennelíva ar panyane tai i ruinesse, leuca ettúle i úrenen ar tancexe máryanna.
When the people there saw the venomous creature hanging from his hand, they said one to the other: “Surely this man is a murderer, and although he was saved from the sea, doom did not allow him to live.”	Íre i queni tasse cenner i hloirea onna lingala máryallo, quentelte quén i exenna: “Tancave nér sina nahtar ná, ar ómu anes rehtana i earello, umbar ua láve sen coita.”
But he shook the venomous creature into the fire and suffered nothing bad.	Mal palles i hloirea onna mir i ruine ar perpére munta olca.
But they thought that he was going to swell, or that suddenly he was going to fall dead. After waiting long and seeing nothing bad happening to him, they changed their mind and said that he was a god.	Ono sannelte i pulumnes, hya i lantumnes rincanen qualina. Apa hopie andave ar cenie munta olca martala sen, vistanelte sámalta ar quenter i náse aino.
Near to that place the most prominent man of the island, called Poplio , had some fields. He received us well and kindly allowed us to dwell in his house for three days.	Hare tana nómenna i tollo amminda nér, estaina Poplio, sáme restali. Camnes me mai ar nildave láve men mare coaryasse ter rí nelde.
But Poplio's father was bed-ridden with fever and dystentery. Paul went in to him and prayed, put his hands on him and healed him.	Mal Poplio atar náne caimassea úrenen ar hruhirdiénen. Paulo lende minna senna ar hyamne, panyane máryat sesse ar nestane se.
After that happened, the other people on the island that had illnesses also came to him and were healed.	Apa ta martane, i hyane queni i tollasse i sámer hlaiweli yú túler senna ar náner nestane.
Thereafter they also glorified us with numerous gifts, and when we sailed away, they gave us things for our needs.	Epeta yú alcaryanelte me rimbe annalínen, ar íre cirnelme oa, antanelte men natali maurelmain.
After three months we sailed away on a ship that came from Alexandria. It had remained through the winter on the island, and it had the Twins as the figurehead .	Apa astar nelde cirnelme oa ciryasse ya túle Alexandriallo. Termarnelyanes ter i hríve i tollasse, ar sámes i Onóni ve i langoemma.
We came to Syracus and remained there for three days.	Túlelme Siracusenna ar lemner tasse ter rí nelde.
From there we went aroud the coast and came to Rhegium, and after one day was a wind from the south, and we arrived in Puteoli on the second day.	Talo lendelme os i falasse ar túler Rehiumenna, ar apa er ré enge súre hyarmello, ar tennelme Puteolisse mí attea ré.
There we found brothers who requested that we would stay with them for seven days, and thus we came into Rome.	Tasse hirnelme hánoli i arcaner i lemyumnelme aselte ter rí otso, ar sie túlelme mir Róma.
And from there the brothers, when they heard the news about us, came to see us as far as Forum Appii and the Three Taverns. Paul, seeing them, gave thanks to God and had courage.	Ar talo i hánor, íre hlasselte i sinyar pa me, túler me-velien tenna Forum Appii ar i Sendassi Nelde. Paulo, cénala te, antane hantale Erun ar sáme huore.
When we came into Rome was permitted to Paul to dwell privately, with the soldier watching him.	Íre lendelme mir Róma náne lávina Paulon mare vérave, as i ohtar tirila se.
But after three days he summoned who were among the prominent men of the Jews. After they assembled he said to them: “Men, brothers, though I did nothing against the people or the customs from our fathers, I was given over from Jerusalem into hands of Romans.	Mal apa rí nelde yaldes i náner imíca i minde neri i Yúraron. Apa ocomnelte quentes téna: “Neri, hánor, ómu fcarnen munta ana i lie hya i haimi atarilvaron, inye náne antana olla Yerúsalemello mannar Rómearon.
They, after making an inquiry, wished to free me, since was not guilt worthy of death in me.	Té, apa carie ceşie, merner lerya ni, pan ua enge cáma valda qualmeo nisse.
But when the Jews spoke against that, it was necessary for me to put my case before the High King – but not as if I have anything evil to say against my nation.	Mal íre i Yúrar quenter ana ta, mauyane nin panya nattonya epe i Ingaran – mal lá ve au samin aiqua ulca quetien ana nórenya.
For this reason I therefore requested to see you and to speak to you, for by reason of the hope of Israel I am carrying this chain.”	Casta sinanen etta arcanen le-vele ar quete lenna, an castanen i estelo Israélo cólan limil sina.”
They said to him: “We have not received letters about you from Judea; furthermore; no one of the brothers that have come have said anything bad about you.	Quentelte senna: “Ualme acámier mentar pa lyé Yúreallo; ente, úquen i hánoron i utúlier equétie aiqua olca pa lye.
But we think it is proper to hear from you what your thoughts are, for indeed we know about this sect that in every place one speaks against it.”	Mal sanalme i vanima ná hlare lyello mana sanwelyar nar, an é istalme pa heren sina i mi ilya nóme mo quete ana sa.”
They fixed a day when they were going to see him and came to where he lived, more numerous than they were the first time. From morning to evening he told and witnessed to them about God's kingdom, and from the Law and from the prophets he tried to give them understanding about Jesus.	Tancelte aure yasse velumneltes ar túler yanna marnes, rimbe lá ya anelte mí minya lú. Arinello şinyenna nyarnes ar vettanes tien pa Eruo aranie, ar i Şanyello ar i Erutercánollon néves anta tien hande pa Yésus.
Some among them listened to his words, but others failed to believe.	Ennoli mici te lastaner quettaryannar, mal exeli loitaner save.
Since they were split they went away, but Paul said a single saying to them: “Truly the Holy Spirit spoke to your fathers through Isaiah the Prophet,	Pan anelte şance oantelte, mal Paulo quente téna erya quetie: “Nanwave i Aire Fea carampe atarildannar ter Yesaia i Erutercáno,
saying: 'Go to this people and say: Indeed you will hear, but you will by no means understand, and indeed you will look, but you will by no means see.	quétala: 'Mena lie sinanna ar queta: É hlaruvalde, mal laume hanyuvalde; ar é yétuvalde, mal laume cenuvalde.
For the heart of this people has become blunt, and their ears are heavy of hearing, and their eyes they have closed – stopping them from perceiving with their eyes and from hearing with their ears and from understanding with their heart and from finding repentance , for me to heal them.'	An lie sino enda olólie ilaica, ar hlarultat nát lunge hlariéno, ar hendultat apahtielte – te-pustala tuntiello hendultanten ar hlariello hlarultanten ar haniello endaltanen ar hiriello inwis, nestienyan te.'
Therefore, may it be known to you that this salvation has been sent to the nations; they will also hear.”	Etta, nai nauva sinwa len i rehtie sina anaie mentana i nórennar; té yú hlaruvar.”
And after he said these words, the Jews went away, having a great dispute among themselves.	Ar apa quentes quettar sine, i Yúrar oanter, arwe túra costo mici inte.
Then he remained for two years in the house where he paid to live, and he received all that came to him,	Tá termarnes loa attasse mí coa yasse paityanes marien, ar camnes illi i túler senna,
making God's kingdom known and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness, without anyone stopping him.	carila Eruo aranie sinwa ar peantala pa i Heru Yésus Hristo ilya veriénen, pen aiquen pustala se.
Paul, apostle of Jesus Christ by God's will, and Timothy the brother,	Paulo, Yésus Hristo apostel Eruo indómenen, ar Timoşeo i háno,
to the holy and faithful brothers in Christ that are in Colossae: Grace to you, and peace from God our Father.	i airi ar voronde hánonnar Hristosse i ear mi Colosse: Lisse len, ar raine Eru Atarelvallo.
We always give thanks to God, the Father of Jesus Christ our Lord, while we are praying about you.	Antalme illume hantale Erun, Yésus Hristo Herulvo Atar, lan hyámalme pa le.
For we have heard about your faith in Christ Jesus and about the love that you have for all the holy ones,	An ahlárielme pa savielda mi Hristo Yésus ar pa i melme ya samilde ilye i airiva,
by the hope that has been reserved for you in heaven. About that you have heard previously, by the true word of the gospel	i estelden ya anaie sátina len menelde. Pa ta ahlárielde nóvo, i nanwa quettanen i evandilyono
that is among yourselves. Just as it bears fruit and thrives in the whole world, so also among you, from the day that you listened and knew God's grace in truth.	ya ea mici le. Tambe colis yáve ar ale i quenda mardesse, síve yando mici lé, i aurello ya lastanelde ar sinter Eruo lisse nanwiesse.
That is what you learnt from Epaphras, a beloved slave with us, who on your behalf is a faithful servant to Christ.	Ta ná ya apárielde ho Epafras, melda mól aselme, ye rá len voronda núro Hriston ná.
He also showed us your love, by spirit.	Yando tannes men melmelda, fairenen.
Therefore we as well, from the day that we heard it, have not ceased to pray and make request for you that you will be filled with knowledge of his will in all wisdom and understanding of the spirit,	Etta yando elme, i aurello yasse hlasselme sa, uar upustie hyame ar arca len i nauvalde quátine istyanen indómeryo mi ilya sailie ar hande i faireo,
in order to walk worthily before the Lord, giving him perfect joy when you bear fruit and grow in the knowlege of God,	vantien valdave epe i Heru, antala sen ilvana alasse íre colilde yáve ar alir mí istya Eruo,
by all power being made mighty, by the might of his glory. Thus you get all steadfastness and patience, with joy,	ilya túrenen nála cárine taure, alcareryo melehtenen. Sie ñetuvalde ilya voronwe ar cóle, as alasse,
giving thanks to the Father who made you worthy to receive your portion of the light which the holy ones shall possess.	antala hantale i Ataren ye carne le valde camien masselda i calo ya i airi haryuvar.
He delivered us out of the power of the darkness and brought us over into the kingdom of his beloved Son,	Etelehtanes vi et i túrello i morniéva ar talle vi olla mir i aranie melda Yondoryo,
by whom we have our ransom, the forgiveness of our sins.	yenen samilve nanwerelva, i apsenie úcarelvaiva.
He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation,	Náse i úcénima Aino emma, i minnóna ilya ontiéno,
and by him all things were created in heaven and on earth, the visible ones and the invisible ones, not heeding if they are thrones or lordships or governments or powers. Everything has been created through him and for him,	an sénen ilye nati náner ontaine menelde ar cemende, i cénimar ar i úcénimar, lá címala qui nalte mahalmali hya héreli hya turiéli hya túreli. Ilqua ter sé ar sén anaie ontaina,
for he is before all things, and all things were by him caused to exist,	ar sé ea nó ilye nati, ar ilye nati sénen náner tyárine ea,
and he is head of his body: the congregation. He is the beginning, the firstborn from dead, for him to be in all things the first.	ar sé ná cas hroaryo: i ocombe. Náse i yesta, i minnóna qualinallon, náveryan mi ilye nati i minya.
For God thought well about causing the entire fullness to dwell in him,	An Eru sanne mai pa tyarie i quanda quantie mare sesse,
and through him unite all things with himself, after making peace by the blood of his cross, the things on earth and the things in heaven alike.	ar ter sé erta ilye nati as inse, apa carie raine i sercenen tarweryo, i nati cemende ar i nati menelde véla.
Also with you, who were at a time strangers and of a hostile mind by your wicked deeds,	Yando as elde, i náner mi lú ettelear ar cotya sámo olce cardaldainen,
he has now made peace by his fleshly body, by dying, to place you holy and perfect and beyond accusation before himself	sí acáries raine i hroaryanen hráveva, qualiénen, panien le airi ar ilvane ar han ulquetie epe inse
– if indeed you remain in the faith, made firm on the foundation and steadfast, and not being caused to abandon the hope of the gospel that you heard, that which has been made known in the entire creation under heaven. For this gospel I, Paul, was made a servant.	– qui é termarilde i saviesse, tulcaine i talmasse ar voronde, ar lá nála tyárine hehta i estel i evandilyono ya hlasselde, ta ya anaie carna sinwa i quanda ontiesse nu menel. Evandilyon sinan inye, Paulo, náne carna núro.
Now I find joy in our sufferings concerning you, and I am filling what is lacking of the sufferings of the Christ by means of my flesh, on behalf of his body, which is the congregation.	Sí hirin alasse perperielmassen pa elde, ar inye quáta ya pénina ná i perperiéron i Hristo hrávenyanen, rá hroaryan, ya i ocombe ná.
To it I was made a servant by the leadership from God which was given to me for your good, to make true God's word,	San inye náne carna núro i hérenen Erullo ya náne nin antaina márieldan, carien nanwa Eruo quetta,
the secret which was hidden from the past ages and generations. But now it has been revealed to his holy ones,	i fóle ya náne nurtaina ho i vanwe randar ar nónari. Mal sí anaies apantaina airiryain,
by means of whom God has wished to make known among the nations what the glorious riches of this secret are. That is Christ in you, the hope of glory.	inen Eru emérie care sinwa imíca i nóri mana i alcarinque lari fóle sino nar. Ta ná Hristo lesse, i estel alcaro.
He is whom we make known, showing every man the way and teaching every man all wisdom, for us to show forth every man perfect, in Christ.	Sé ná ye carilme sinwa, tánala ilya atanen i tie ar peantala ilya atanen ilya sailie, ettanielman ilya atan ilvana, Hristosse.
For that I also toil, fighting by his work that works in me with power.	Tan yando mótan, mahtala molieryanen ya mole nisse túrenen.
For I want you to know how profound is the struggle that I have on your behalf and of the people in Laodicea and of those that have not seen my face in the flesh,	An merin le ista manen tumna ná i mahtie ya samin rá elden ar i quenin Laoriceasse ar in uar ecénie cendelenya i hrávesse,
to comfort their heart, for them to be united in love and for them toreceive the whole riches of a full understanding, and for them to get knowledge of the mystery of God: Christ.	tiutien endalta, náveltan ertaine melmesse ar camieltan i quanda lar quanta handeo, ar ñetieltan istya i fóleo Eruo: Hristo.
Hidden in him are all the treasures of wisdom and of knowlegde.	Nurtaine sesse ear ilye i harmar sailiéva ar istyava.
This thing I say to stop anyone from causing you to stray with seductive speech.	Nat sina quetin pustien aiquen tyariello le ranya sahtala quetiénen.
For though I am away in the flesh, I am still with you in the spirit, having joy and beholding how you are well-organized and true in your faith in Christ.	An ómu nanye oa i hrávesse, nanye en aselde i fairesse, arwa alasseo ar yétala manen nalde partaine ar şande mi savielda Hristosse.
Therefore, since you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, walk in him,	Etta, pan acámielde Hristo Yésus i Heru, á vanta sesse,
having your roots in him and being built up in him, established in the faith – as was taught to you, giving thanks in abundance.	arwe şunduldar mi sé ar nála carastaine ama sesse, tulcaine i saviesse – ve náne peantaina len, antala hantale úvesse.
Be awake, to stop anyone from drawing you away with the philosophy and the empty deception which follows the teachings received from men – following the world's poor things and not Christ.	Na coive, pustien aiquen tuciello le oa i ingolénen ar i lusta hurulénen ya hilya i peantier cámine atanillon – hilyala i mardo penye nati ar lá Hristo.
For in him the entire divine fullness dwells in a body.	An sesse i quanda valaina quantie mare hroasse.
Thus you are filled by him who is the head of all lordship and power.	Sie nalde quátine sénen ye ná i cas ilya héreo ar túreo.
In him you were also circumcised with a circumcision which is not by hands or takes flesh away from the body – by the circumcision of the Christ.	Mi sé anelde yando oscírine osciriénen ya ua mainen hya mapa hráve oa i hroallo – i osciriénen i Hristo.
For you were placed with him in a grave by baptism, and by him you were also raised up with him, by reason of your faith and the work of God, who raised him from dead.	An anelde panyaine óse sapsasse i tumyalénen, ar sénen anelde yando ortaine ama óse, castanen savieldo ar i moliénen Eruo, ye se-ortane qualinallon.
Furthermore, though you were dead in your crimes and in your lack of circumcision in your flesh, God made you alive with him. He forgave us all our crimes	Ente, ómu anelde qualinar ongweldassen ar penieldasse oscirie hráveldasse, Eru le-carne coirie óse. Apsennes ven ilye ongwelvar
and wiped away the writing of guilt which was against us, and he has taken it away by fastening it to the cross with nails.	ar aupsarne i tecie rohtava ya náne ana ve, ar amápies sa oa taciénen sa i tarwenna taxelínen.
He made the lordships and the powers naked and openly showed them forth for mockery, after he had his victory over them on the cross.	Carnes i héri ar i túri helde ar pantave ettanne tai yaiwen, apa sámes apairerya or tai i tarwesse.
Therefore may no one among you judge you concerning eating or drinking and concerning a festival or new moon or day of rest,	Etta nai úquen mici le namuva le pa matie ar sucie ar pa aşar hya ceuran hya sendare,
for these things are a shadow of the coming things, but the actual thing is of the Christ.	an nati sine nar leo i túlala nation, mal i anwa nat ná i Hristova.
Do not let anyone take away your crown of victory who has his joy in “lowliness” and worship of angels. His thoughts are fixed on the things that he has seen in vision, and he praises himself without reason, by his fleshly mind.	Áva lave aiquenen mapa oa ríelda apaireva ye same alasserya mi “naldie” ar tyerme valaiva. Sanweryar nar tácine i natissen yar ecénies mi maur, ar laitas inse ú casto, sámaryanen hráveva.
He does not stick to the head, him from whom the entire body – kept together and having its support by its joints and bonds – grows with the growth that God gives.	Uas himya i cas, sé yello i quanda hroa – hépina uo ar arwa tulcuryo oxaryainen ar núteryainen – ale i aliénen ya Eru anta.
If you died with Christ from the poor things of the world, how is that you, as if you still dwell in the world, behave by the commands:	Qui quallelde as Hristo i mardo penye natillon, manen ná i elde, ve qui en marilde i mardesse, lengar i canwainen:
“Do not touch, do not taste, do not feel” –	“Áva appa, áva tyave, áva pelta” –
concerning things that are destined for destruction by being used, by the commands and teachings of men? 	pa nati yar nar martyaine nancarien návenen yuhtaine, i canwainen ar peantiainen atanion?
These things have an appearance of wisdom in a worship that people have chosen for themselves, and in “lowliness” and behaving towards the body in a harsh manner, but they are not of benefit for stopping the desires of the flesh from being filled.	Nati sine haryar ilce sailiéva mi tyerie ya queni icílier inten, ar mi “naldie” ar lengie i hroanna mi naraca lé, mal ualte aşie pustien i hráveo íri návello quátine.
But if you were raised with the Christ, seek the high things, in which the Christ is sitting by God's right hand.	Mal qui anelde ortaine as i Hristo, á cesta i artar, yassen i Hristo hára ara Eruo forma.
Give heed to the high things, not the things on earth.	Cima i artar, lá i nati cemende.
For you died, and your life has been hidden with the Christ, in God.	An quallelde, ar coivielda anaie nurtaina as i Hristo, Erusse.
When the Christ, our life, shall be revealed, then you as well will be revealed with him in glory.	Íre i Hristo, coivielva, nauva apantaina, tá yando elde nauvar apantaine óse alcaresse.
Therefore let die the body-parts that you have on earth, concerning fornication, uncleanness, sexual lust, wicked desire and greed, which is idol-worship.	Etta lava quale i hroarantain yar samilde cemende, pa hrupuhtie, úpoicie, yére, olca íre ar milcie, ya cordontyerie ná.
Because of these things God's wrath comes upon the people that break his orders.	Sine natinen Eruo rúşe tule i queninnar i racir canwaryar.
In these things you too walked formerly, when they filled your life.	Mi nati sine yando elde vantaner yá, íre tai quanter coivielda.
But now you too put away everything: wrath, rage, wickedness, blasphemy, and dirty talk out of your mouth.	Mal sí yando elde á panya oa ilqua: rúşe, aha, olcie, naiquetie, ar vára carpie et antoldallo.
Do not lie one to the other. Put away the old man with his doings,	Áva hure quén i exen. Á panya oa i yára atan as carieryar,
and cover yourselves with the new man, who by knowledge is renewed by the image of who created him.	ar topa inde i vinya atannen, ye istyanen ná envinyanta i emmanen yeo ontane se.
Here is not Greek or Jew, circumcision or uncircumcision, foreign person, Scythian, slave, free person, but everything and in all Christ is.	Sís ua ea Hellenya hya Yúra, oscirie hya úoscirie, ettelea quén, Scişa, mól, léra quén, mal ilqua ar mi illi Hristo ná.
Therefore, as God's chosen ones, holy and beloved, cover yourselves with the feelings of sympathy, of goodness, of a lowly mind, of gentleness, of patience.	Etta, ve Eruo cílinar, airi ar melde, topa inde i felmínen ofelmeva, máriéva, nalda sámava, moiciéva, cóleva.
Bear the others and forgive one another, if anyone has a complaint against another. As the Lord forgave you, so you forgive, you as well.	Cola i exi ar apsena quén i exin, qui aiquen same nur exenna. Tambe i Heru apsenne elden, síve alde apsene, yando elde.
But in addition to all these things cover yourselves with love, which is a perfect bond between you.	Mal napaniesse ilye sine natin topa inde melmenen, ya ná ilvana núte imbi le.
Furthermore, let the peace of Christ rule in your heart, to which you were called in one body, and give thanks!	Ente, lava i Hristo rainen ture endaldasse, yanna anelde yáline mi hroa er, ar hantale alde anta!
Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly. In all wisdom instruct one another and show to one another the way with psalms, with songs of praise, with spiritual songs in grace, singing in your heart to God.	Lava i Hristo quettan mare lesse alyave. Ilya sailiesse á peanta quén i exen ar á tana quen i exen i tie airelindínen, lírínen laitaléva, fairelírínen mi lisse, lindala endaldasse Erun.
And every thing that you ever do, by word or by deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.	Ar ilya nat ya oi carilde, quettanen hya cardanen, cara ilqua mí esse i Heru Yésuo, antala hantale Eru i Ataren ter sé.
You women , put yourselves under your husbands, as is proper in the Lord.	A nissi, á panya inde nu veruldar, ve vanima ná i Herusse.
You men, love your wives and do not be bitterly angry towards them.	A neri, mela verildar ar áva na sárave rúşie téna.
You children, heed your parents' commands in everything, for that is pleasing to the Lord.	A híni, cima nostaruldato canwar mi ilqua, an ta mára ná i Herun.
You fathers, do not cause your children grief, or you will take away their courage.	A atari, áva tyare hínaldain nyére, hya mapuvalde oa huorelta.
You slaves, give in everything heed to the will of who are your lords by the flesh, not like eye-servants, as if to please men, but sincerely, fearing the Lord.	A móli, cima mi ilqua i nirme ion nar heruldar i hrávenen, lá ve hendunúror, ve qui fastien atani, mal holmo, rúcala i Herullo.
Anything that you do, work with your entire soul, as for the Lord and not for men.	Aiqua ya carilde, mola quanda fealdanen, ve i Herun ar lá atanin.
for you know that you will receive from the Lord your reward, the part that you will possess as heirs. Be servants to the Lord Jesus.	An istalde i camuvalde i Herullo paityalelda, i ranta ya haryuvalde ve aryoni. Na móli i Heru Yésun.
For who does injustice will received back his injustice, and there is not heeding of face .	An ye care úfailie nancamuva úfailierya, ar ua ea cimie cendeléva.
You lords , give to your slaves what is just and proper, knowing that you as well have a Lord in heaven.	A heruvi, á anta mólildain ya faila ar vanima ná, istala i yando elde samir Heru menelde.
Be steadfast in prayer, awake in it by thanksgiving,	Na voronde hyamiesse, coive sasse hantalénen,
at every moment praying also for us, requesting that God will open to us a door of the Word, to speak the mystery concerning Christ, concerning whom I am also in fetters,	mí imya lú hyámala yando elmen, arcala i Eru pantuva men fenna i Quetto, quetien i fóle pa Hristo, pa ya nanye yando naxalissen,
for me to reveal it, as is necessary for me to speak.	apantienyan sa, ve mauya nin quete.
Behave with wisdom to that are on the outside, seizing the opportunity .	Á lenga sailiénen in ear i ettesse, mápala i ecie.
Allow your word to have grace, its taste strengthened with salt, for you to know how you are to answer everyone.	Lava quettalda illume same lisse, tyáverya antoryaina singenen, istieldan manen hanquetuvalde ilquenna.
All my matters will be make known to you by Tychicus, my beloved brother and a faithful servant and a slave with you in the Lord.	Ilye nattonyar nauvar cárine sinwe len lo Tíhico, melda hánonya ar voronda núro ar mól asinye i Herusse.
I have sent him to you for this same reason: for you to know that concern me, and for him to comfort your heart, I have sent him to you.	Ementienyes lenna sina imya casta: istieldan yar apir mé, ar tiutieryan endalda.
With him I send Onesimus, my steadfast and beloved brother, who is from among you. All the matters here they will make known to you.	Óse mentan Onesimo, voronda ar melda hánonya, ye mici lello ná. Ilye i nattor sisse caruvatte sinwe len.
Aristarchus, who is in gaol with me, greets you. So do Mark, the cousin of Barnabas – concerning him you have received commands: if he comes to you, receive him well –	Aristarco, ye ná mandosse óni, suila le. Sie carir Marco, Varnavasso rendo – pa sé acámielde canwali: qui tulis lenna, áse came mai –
and Jesus called Justus, who are of the circumsized. They alone work with me for the kingdom of God, and they have given me comfort.	ar Yésus estaina Yusto, i nar i oscirnaron. Té erinque molir asinye Eruo aranien, ar anaielte nin tiutale.
Epaphras greets you, he who is from among you, slave of Christ Jesus. Always he fights on your behalf in his prayers, requesting that you will stand perfect and firm in all the will of God.	Epafras suila le, sé ye mici lello ná, mól Hristo Yésuo. Illume mahtas rá elden hyamieryassen, arcala i taruvalde ilvane ar tulce mí quanda indóme Eruo.
Indeed I witness for him that he has a great strife for you and for who are in Laodicea and Hierapolis.	É vettan sen i samis túra mótie elden ar in ear mi Laoricea ar Hierapolis.
Luke, the beloved physician, greets you, as does Demas.	Lúcas, i melda nestando, suila le, ve care Lémas.
Greet the brothers in Laodicea and Nympha and the congregation in her house.	Á suila i hánor Laoriceasse ar Nimfa ar i ocombe coaryasse.
And when this letter has been read among you, make sure that it will be read also to the congregation in Laodicea, and get the letter from Laodicea, allowing you to read it as well.	Ar íre tecetta sina anaie hentaina mici le, tyara i nauvas hentaina yando i ocomben Laoriceasse, ar ñeta i tecetta Laoriceallo, lávala yando elden henta sa.
Furthermore, say to Archippus: “Keep the ministry which you received in the Lord, in order to complete it!”	Ente, queta Arcipponna: “Hepa i núromolie ya camnel i Herusse, telien sa!”
Here I am writing my greeting with my own hand. Recall my chains! May the grace be with you.	Sisse técan suilienya véra mányanen. Enyala naxanyar! Nai i Erulisse euva aselde.
Paul, apostle of Jesus Christ by God's will, to the holy ones that are in Ephesus, steadfast in Christ Jesus:	Paulo, Yésus Hristo apostel Eruo indómenen, i airinnar i ear Efesusse, voronde mi Hristo Yésus:
May you have grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.	Nai samuvalde lisse ar raine ho Eru Atarelva ar i Heru Yésus Hristo.
Blessed be God, Father of Jesus Christ our Lord, who has blessed us with every blessing of the spirit in the heavenly places in Christ,	Aistana na Eru, Yésus Hristo Herulvo Atar, ye vi-aistie ilya aistiénen i faireo mí meneldie nómi Hristosse,
who called us in him before the world was established, for us to be holy and without stain before him in love.	ve vi-cilles sesse nó i mar náne tulcaina, návelvan airi ar ú mordo epe sé melmesse.
For beforehand he appointed us to be received by Jesus Christ as his sons, as he thought well according to his will,	An nóvo vi-santes náven cámine ló Yésus Hristo ve yondoryar, ve sannes mai indómeryanen,
into praise of his glorious grace which he gave us by his Beloved One.	mir laitale alcarinqua lisseryava ya antanes ven Meldaryanen.
By him we have the ransom by his blood: the forgiveness of our sins, by the riches of his grace.	Sénen samilve i nanwere serceryanen: i apsenie úcarilvaiva, lisseryo larnen.
He caused us to have an abundance of all wisdom and understanding,	Vi-tyarnes same úve ilya sailiéva ar handeva,
making known to us the secret of his will, by the choice of his good will:	cárala sinwa ven indómeryo fóle, mára nirmeryo cilmenen:
to establish a plan that he would make real when the time was ready, to gather together all things in Christ – the things in heaven and the things on earth – by him.	tulcie pano ya carumnes anwa íre i lú náne manwa, hostien uo ilye nati i Hristosse – i nati menelde ar i nati cemende – sénen.
In him we were also established as heirs, for us to be previously appointed by the purpose of who works everything by the choice of his will,	Sesse anelve yando tulcaine ve aryoni, návelvanen nóvo sátine i mehtenen yeo mole ilqua indómeryo cilmenen,
for us to be a praise of his glory, we that previously had hope in Christ.	návelvan laitale alcareryava, elve i nóvo sámer estel i Hristosse.
But also you had hope in him after you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation. By him, after you believed, you were also sealed by the Holy Spirit of his promise,	Mal yando elde sámer estel sesse apa hlasselde i quetta nanwiéva, i evandilyon rehtieldo. Sénen, apa sávelde, anelde yando lihtaine vandaryo Aire Feanen,
which is a sign of our part as heirs, as a ransom for his own people, to his glorious praise.	ya ná tanwa rantalvo ve aryoni, ve nanwere véra lieryan, alcarinqua laitaleryan.
Therefore I also – since I have heard about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love of all the holy ones –	Etta yando inye – pan ahlárien pa savielda mí Heru Yésus ar melmelda ilye i airiva –
do not cease to give thanks concering you when I recall you in my prayers,	ua pusta anta hantale pa le íre enyalin le hyamienyassen,
asking that the God of Jesus Christ our Lord will give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation for you to have knowledge about him,	arcala i Yésus Hristo Herulvo Aino antuva len faire sailiéva ar apantiéva samieldan istya pa se,
the eyes of your heart being enlightened, for you to know what the hope is to which he called you – what the glorious riches are which he has reserved for the holy ones that will be heirs to it,	endaldo hendu nála calyaine, istieldan mana i estel ná yan yalles le – mana i alcarinqua lar ná ya asáties i airin i nauvar aryoni san,
and what the abundant greatness of his power is, to us that believe – by the work of his mighty power,	ar mana túreryo úvea túrie ná, elven i savir – i moliénen taura túreryo,
with which he worked in Christ when he raised him up from dead and caused him to sit by his right hand in the heavenly places,	yanen móles i Hristosse íre se-ortanes et qualinillon ar tyarne se hame ara formarya i meneldie nómessen,
far above every government and power and lordship and every name called, not in this age alone, but also in the coming one.	haira or ilya turie ar túre ar hére ar ilya esse estaina, lá sina randasse erinqua, mal yando mí túlala.
And everything he put under his feet, and he made him the head of all things for the congregation,	Ar ilqua panyanes nu talyat, ar carneses i cas ilye nation i ocomben,
which is his body, the fullness of who fills everything in all things.	ya ná hroarya, i quantie yeo quate ilqua ilye natissen.
And you God made alive though you were dead in your crimes and your sins,	Ar elde Eru carne coirie ómu anelde qualini mi ongweldar ar úcareldar,
in which you walked formerly, by the manner of this age, the manner of the ruler who has power over the air, the spirit which now works in the sons of disobedience .	yassen vantanelde yá, randa sino lénen, i lé i turo ye same túre or i vilya, i faire ya sí mole i yondossen canwaraciéno.
Among them we also formerly behaved by the lusts of our flesh, doing the desires and thoughts of the flesh, and by nature we were children of wrath, as were also the others.	Mici té yando elve yá lenganer hrávelvo milminen, cárala i hráveo íri ar sanwi, ar nassenen anelve rúşeo híni, ve náner yando i exi.
But God, being rich in mercy, by his great love with which he loved us,	Mal Eru, nála alya mi oravie, túra melmeryanen yanen méles vi,
made us alive with the Christ, also when we were dead in crimes. By grace we have been saved,	vi-carne coirie as i Hristo, yando íre anelve qualini ongwelissen. Lissenen anaielde rehtaine,
and he raised us up together and allowed us to dwell together in the heavenly places, in Christ Jesus.	ar vi-ortanes uo ar láver ven mare uo i meneldie nómessen, mi Hristo Yésus.
Thus, in the coming ages, the surpassing riches of his grace will be shown by the manner by which he has been friendly to us in Christ Jesus.	Sie, i túlala randassen, lisseryo lahtala lar nauva tanaina i lénen yanen anaies nilda ven mi Hristo Yésus.
For by his grace you have been saved, by faith, and that did not happen by you; the gift is of God,	An lisseryanen anaielde rehtaine, saviénen, ar ta ua martane eldenen; i anna ná Eruo,
it is not by deeds, to stop anyone from praising himself.	uas cardainen, pustien aiquen laitiello inse.
For we are his work and were created in Christ Jesus for good deeds, which God prepared beforehand, for us to walk in them.	An nalve senya tamna ar náner ontaine mi Hristo Yésus máre cardain, yar Eru manwane nóvo, vantielvan mi tai.
Therefore recall that formerly you were people of the nations concerning the flesh. You were called Uncircumcision by that which is called Circumcision, made in the flesh with hands.	Etta enyala i yá anelde queni i nórion pa i hráve. Anelde estaine Úoscirie lo ta ya ná estaina Oscirie, carna i hrávesse mainen.
For you were at that time without Christ, foreign to the kindred of Israel and strangers to the covenants of the promise, and you did not have hope and were without God in the world.	An anelde mi yana lúme ú Hristo, ettelie nossen Israélo ar ettelear i vérin i vandava, ar ualde sáme estel ar náner ú Eruo i mardesse.
But now, in Jesus Christ, you that formerly were far away are now brought near, by the blood of the Christ.	Mal sí, mi Yésus Hristo, elde i yá náner haire nar sí talaine hari, i Hristo sercenen.
For he is our peace, he who made both one and undid the middle wall between them . The hostile state by his flesh	An sé rainelva ná, sé ye carne yúyo er ar nancarne i enya ramba imbe tu. I cotya sóma hráveryanen
he took away, the Law of commands in orders , to make in himself the two peoples into a one new man, by making peace –	nampes oa, i Şanye axanion mi canwali, carien insesse i lie atta mir vinya atan er, cariénen raine –
to make both without strife with God in one body by the cross; for he slew the hostile state by himself.	carien yúyo ú costo as Eru mi hroa er i tarwenen; an nacantes i cotya sóma insenen.
And he came and made the gospel of peace known to you that were far off, and peace to that are near,	Ar túles ar carne i evandilyon raineva sinwa len i náner haire, ar raine in nar hari,
for through him we, both peoples, may come near, in one spirit, to the Father.	an ter sé engwe, yúyo lie, lertat tule hare, mi faire er, i Atarenna.
Therefore you are no more foreigners and people that live in a land not your own, but you are neighbors with the holy ones and dwell in God's house,	Etta ualde ambe ettelear ar queni i marir nóresse lá véralda, mal nalde asambaror as i airi ar marir coasse Eruva,
and you have been built up on the ground of the apostles and of the prophets, while Christ Jesus himself is the stone of the corner.	ar anaielde carastaina ama i talmasse i apostelíva ar i Erutercánoiva, íre Hristo Yésus inse i ondo i vinco ná.
In him the entire building is put together and grows into a holy temple to the Lord.	Mi sé i quanda ataque ná panyaina uo ar ale mir aire corda i Herun.
In him also you are built up together into a place where God will dwell by spirit.	Mi sé yando elde nar carastaine ama uo mir nóme yasse Eru maruva fairenen.
Therefore also I, Paul, who for Jesus Christ is in gaol on behalf of you that are of the nations ...	Etta yando inye, Paulo, ye Yésus Hriston mandosse ná rá elden i nar i nórion ...
– if indeed you have heard about the oversight of the grace of God which was given me for your good,	– qui é ahlárielde pa i ortírie i Erulisseva ya náne nin antaina márieldan,
how by revelation the mystery that told to me, as I wrote in brief previously.	manen apantiénen i fóle náne nyárina nin, ve tencen şintave nóvo.
Thus it is possible for you, reading my letter, to understand the insight that I have on the mystery of the Christ.	Sie ece len, cendala tecettanya, hanya i tercen ya samin i fóleva i Hristo.
In former generations this mystery was not made known to the sons of men as now by spirit it has been made known to his holy apostles and to his heralds :	Yane nónaressen fóle sina úne carna sinwa i atanyondoin ve sí fairenen anaies carna sinwa airi apostelyain ar tercánoryain:
how people of the nations will be heirs and members and will have a part with us of the promise, in Jesus Christ, by the gospel.	manen queni i nórion nauvar aryoni ar hroarantar ar samuvar ranta aselme i vando, mi Yésus Hristo, i evandilyonnen.
I have been made a servant to this gospel by the grace of God, which has been given me by his power working in me.	Anaien carna núro evandilyon sinan i lissenen Eruo, ya anaie antaina nin túreryanen mólala nisse.
To me, a man smaller than the smallest of all the holy ones, this grace has been given, for me to make known to the nations the gospel about the Christ's riches beyond measure,	Inyen, nér pitya lá i ampitya ilye i airion, lisse sina náne antaina, carienyan sinwa i nórin i evandilyon pa i lar han lesta i Hristova,
and to show how God makes real the secret that from eternity has been hidden in God who created all things,	ar tanien manen Eru care anwa i fóle ya oiollo anaie nurtaina Erusse ye ontane ilye nati,
now to make known, through the congregation, to those that rule and have lordship in heavenly places God's diverse wisdom,	sí carien sinwa, ter i ocombe, in túrar ar samir hére meneldie nómessen Eruo lincantea sailie,
by the eternal purpose that he formed in Christ, our Lord Jesus.	i oira mehtenen ya carnes mí Hristo, Yésus Herulva.
By him we have boldness and may come near without fear, by our belief in him.	Sénen samilve verie ar lertar tule hare ú ruciéno, savielvanen sesse.
Therefore I ask: Do not turn from your goal because of these tribulations of mine on your behalf, which are a glory to you.	Etta arcan: Áva quere inde mehteldallo sine şangienyainen rá elden, yar nar alcar len.
By this reason I fall upon my knees before the Father,	Sina castanen lantan occanyanta epe i Atar,
by whom every family in heaven and earth is named.	lo ye ilya nosse mi menel cemenye ná estaina.
Thus, out of his riches he can give you by his spirit to be made mighty by might in your internal man,	Sie, et laryallo polis anta len faireryanen náve cárine taure melehtenen mitya ataneldasse,
in order to cause the Christ to dwell in your heart by your faith, in love having a root and a foundation,	tyarien i Hristo mare indoldasse savieldanen, melmesse arwe şunduo ar talmo,
for you to be able to understand, with the holy ones, the breadth and length and height and depth,	ecien len hanya, as i airi, i landie ar andie ar tárie ar núrie,
and for you to know the Christ's love which surpasses knowledge, for you to be filled with God's fullness.	ar istieldan i Hristo melme ya lahta istya, náveldan quátine Eruo quantiénen.
To who can do far more than everything you request or think, by his power which works in us,	Yen pole care ambela ilqua ya arcalve hya sanalve, túreryanen ya mole vesse,
to him be the glory by the congregation and by Christ Jesus in all generations forever and ever! Amen.	sen na i alcar i ocombenen ar Hristo Yésunen mi ilye nónari tennoio ar oi! Násie.
Therefore I, who am in gaol by reason of the Lord, ask of you: Walk in a manner worthy of the calling with which you were called,	Etta inye, ye ea mandosse castanen i Heruo, arca lello: Á vanta mi lé valda i yaliéno yanen anelde yáline,
having all lowliness of mind and a mild manner, suffering one another with love,	arwe quanda naldiéno sámo ar milya léo, perpérala quén i exe melmenen,
sincerely trying to keep the oneness of the spirit with a bond of peace.	holmo návala hepe i erie i faireo nútenen raineva.
There are one body and one spirit, as you were called in the one hope of your calling,	Ear er hroa ar er faire, ve anelde yáline i er estelde yalieldo,
one Lord, one faith, one baptism,	er Heru, er savie, er tumyale,
one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.	er Aino ar Atar illion, ye ea or illi ar ter illi ar mi illi.
But to every single person among us the grace has been given, by the measure by which the gift of the Christ is distributed.	Mal ilya erya quenen mici vi i lisse anaie antaina, i lestanen yanen i Hristo anna etsátina ná.
Therefore he says: “When he went up to on high he brought away people in captivity; he gave gifts to men.”	Etta quetis: “Íre lendes ama tárienna tulyanes oa queneli mandosse; antanes annali atanin.”
What do the words “he went up” mean, if not that he also went down to the lower regions, that is, to earth?	Mana i quettar “lendes ama” tear, qui lá i yando lendes undu i ambe núre ménannar, ta ná, cemenna?
 who went down is also who went up to above all heavens, for him to give fullness to all things.	Ye lende undu ná yando ye lende ama or ilye menelinnar, antieryan quantie ilye natin.
And he gave some people as apostles, some as prophets, some to preach the gospel, some like shepherds and teachers .	Ar antanes queneli ve apostelli, queneli ve Erutercánoli, queneli quetien i evandilyon, queneli ve mavalli ar peantalli.
Thus he prepared the holy ones for their work as servants, to build up the Christ's body,	Sie manwanes i airi molieltan ve núror, carastien ama i Hristo hroa,
until all among us shall be one by our faith and by our knowing the son of God – for us to be a perfect man, for us to have the full height of the fullness of Christ.	tenna illi mici vi nauvar er savielvanen ar istielvanen i Eruion – návelvan ilvana atan, samielvan i quanda táriéno i quantiéno Hristova.
Thus we will not be babes more, thrown up and down by waves and carried hither and thither by every wind of teaching, by the tricks of men, by the cunning in inventing error.	Sie ualve nauva lapsi ambe, hátine ama ar undu falmalínen ar cóline sir ar tar ilya súrinen peantiéva, atanion fintalínen, i curunen autiesse loimava.
But speaking the truth, may we grow up by love in all things into who is the head: Christ,	Mal quétala i nanwie, nai aluvalve ama melmenen mi ilye nati mir ye i cas ná: Hristo,
out of whom the entire body is put together and made one, every joint adding its work by the measure of every single part. Thus the body causes itself to grow, building itself up in love.	et yello i quanda hroa ná panyaina uo ar carna er, ilya lequet napánala molierya i lestanen ilya erya ranto. Sie i hroa tyarixe ale, carastala insa melmesse.
This thing I therefore say and I witness to you in the Lord: Do not walk anymore like the nations also walk by their empty minds,	Nat sina etta quetin ar vettan len i Herusse: Áva vanta ambe ve i nóri yando vantar luste sámaltainen,
their understanding being in darkness, strangers to the life of God, by the incomprehension that is in them by their blunt heart.	handelta nála morniesse, ettelear i coivien Eruo, i úhandenen ya ea tesse ilaica endaltanen.
After their perception of good and evil faded, they gave themselves to loose conduct, to working every kind of uncleanness in greed.	Apa tuntierya máriéva ar ulcuva firne, antaneltexer lehta lengien, molien ilya nostaleo úpoicie milciesse.
But so you have not learnt about the Christ,	Mal sie elde uar apárie pa i Hristo,
if indeed you heard him and were instructed by him, as is true in Jesus:	qui é hlasseldes ar náner peantaine lo sé, ve nanwa ná Yésusse:
Put away what follows your former behavior, the old man marred by seductive desires,	Á panya oa ya hilya vanwa lengieldo, i yára atan hastaina şahtala írelínen,
for you to be renewed in the spirit of your mind	náveldan envinyante i fairesse sámaldo
and for you to put on yourselves the new man that is created by God's will, in righteousness and holiness of the truth.	ar panieldan indesse i vinya atan ye náne ontaina Eruo indómenen, i nanwiéno failiesse ar airesse.
Therefore, now when you have put away lie, speak truth, everyone among you with his neighbor, for we are each one the other's body-parts .	Etta, sí íre apánielde oa huru, queta nanwie, ilquen mici le as armarorya, an nalve ilquen i exeo hroarantar.
Be wrathful, and yet do not sin; do not allow the sun to set on your wrath.	Na rúşie, ananta áva úcare; áva lave Anaren núta rúşeldanna.
Therefore, do not give the Devil room.	Ente, áva anta i Araucon nóme.
It is necessary for the thief to stop stealing, but may he work with his hands doing what is good, allowing him to have thing to distribute to that are in need.	Mauya i pilun pusta pile, mal nai moluvas máryanten cárala ya mára ná, lávala sen same nat etsatien in nar mauresse.
Do not allow foul word to come out of your mouth, but speak every saying that is good in order to build up, as the need is, in order to give a grace to who listen.	Áva lave şaura quettan tule et antoldallo, mal queta ilya quetie ya mára ná carastien ama, ve i maure ná, antien lisse in lastar.
Furthermore, do not cause grief to God's holy spirit, by which you have been sealed for the day of ransom.	Ente, áva tyare nyére Eruo aire fean, yanen anaielde lihtaine i auren nanwereva.
May every bitterness and wrath and anger and outcry and blasphemy be taken away from you, with every evil.	Nai ilya sárie ar rúşe ar orme ar yamie ar naiquetie nauvar mapaine oa lello, as ilya ulco.
But be loving one against the other, having compassion, forgiving one the other like God in Christ forgave you.	Mal na méle quén i exen, arwe ofelmeo, apsénala quén i exen ve Eru mi Hristo apsenne len.
Therefore, be like God, like beloved children,	Etta, na ve Eru, ve méline híni,
and walk in love, like the Christ also loved you and gave himself on your behalf, as a gift and a sacrifice to God, for a fragrant smell.	ar á vanta melmesse, ve yando i Hristo méle le ar antane inse rá len, ve anna ar yanca Erun, níşima olmen.
May every kind of fornication and uncleanness, or greediness, not be named among you, as is good for holy ones.	Nai ilya nostaleo hrupuhtie ar úpoicie, hya milcie, ua nauva estaina mici le, ve mára airin ná.
Thus also concerning low behavior and foolish talk or dirty jokes, which are not a good habit; better it is to give thanks.	Sie yando pa núra lengie ar auca quetie hya váre tuncinyarnar, yar uar mára haime; arya ná antie hantale.
For this thing you know: You understand that a fornicating or unclean or greedy person – which means that he worships idols – will not be an heir of the kingdom of Christ and God.	An nat sina istalde: Hanyalde i hrupuhtala hya úpoica hya milca quén – ya tea i tyeris cordoni – ua nauva aryon i Hristo ar Eruo araniéno.
Do not allow anyone to cause you to stray by means of empty words, for by these things God's anger is coming upon that are not obedient.	Áva lave aiquenen tyare le ranya luste quettainen, an sine natainen Eruo rúşe túla innar uar canwacimye.
Therefore do not have part with them.	Etta áva same ranta aselte.
For formerly you were darkness, but now you are light, in the Lord. Walk as children of light,	An yá anelde mornie, mal sí nalde cala, i Herusse. Á vanta ve híni calo,
for the fruit of light is every kind of goodness and justice and truth.	an i calo yáve ná ilya nostaleo márie ar failie ar nanwie.
Seek what is good to the Lord,	Á cesta mana mára ná i Herun,
and do not have part in the fruitless deeds of darkness; you do better rebuking them.	ar áva same ranta i yávelóre cardassen morniéno; carilde arya naityala tai.
For that happen by them are a shame also to tell .	An yar martar tainen ná naityale yando nyare.
But the things rebuked are revealed by the light, for everything that is revealed, is light.	Mal i nati naityaine nar apantaine i calanen,
Therefore he says: “Be awake, you who are sleeping, and rise from dead, and the Christ shall shine upon you.”	an ilqua ya ná apantaina, cala ná. Etta quetis: “Na coiva, elye ye húma, ar á orta qualinillon, ar i Hristo caluva lyenna.”
Therefore watch closely that how you walk is not like unwise ones, but like wise ones,	Etta tira harive i manen vantalde ua ve alasailar, mal ve sailar,
trading to yourselves the good moment, for the days are evil.	mancala inden i mára lú, an i auri nar ulce.
Therefore do not be unintelligent, but perceive what the Lord's will is.	Etta áva na úhande, mal á tunta mana i Heruo indóme ná.
Furthermore, do not fill yourselves with wine, which causes self-control to go away, but be filled with spirit,	Ente, áva quate inde limpenen, ya tyare immoturie auta, mal na quátine fairenen,
speaking to yourselves with holy songs and praises to God and with spiritual songs, singing and making tunes in your heart to the Lord,	quétala indenna airelírínen ar laitalínen Erun ar fairelírínen, lindala ar cárala líri endaldasse i Herun,
by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ giving thanks always concerning all things, to God the Father.	Herulva Yésus Hristo essenen hantala illume pa ilye nati, Eru i Ataren.
Be submissive to one another , in fear of the Christ.	Á panya inde nu quén i exe, ruciesse Yésus Hristollo.
It is necessary for the wives to subject themselves to their husbands, like they place themselves under the Lord,	Mauya i verin panya inte nu verultar, ve panyaltexer nu i Heru,
for a husband is his wife's head as also the Christ is head of the congregation, he being who saves his body.	an veru ná veriryo cas ve yando i Hristo ná cas i ocombeo, sé nála ye rehta hroarya.
But like the congregation subjects itself to the Christ, so may the women do to their husbands in everything.	Mal tambe i ocombe panya insa nu i Hristo, síve nai i nissi caruvar verultain ilquasse.
You husbands, love your wives, like the Christ also loved the congregation and gave himself for it,	A veruvi, mela verildar, ve i Hristo yando méle i ocombe ar antane inse san,
for him to hallow it, cleansing it by the bath of water by the word,	airitieryan sa, poitala sa i sovallenen nenwa i quettanen,
for him to place the congregation before himself glorious, without a spot or wrinkle or anything like that, but for him to be holy and without a stain.	panieryan i ocombe epe inse alcarinqua, ú mordo hya helmunque hya aiqua ve ta, mal náveryan aire ar ú vaxeo.
Thus also the debt of the husbands is loving the women like their own bodies. Who loves his wife loves himself,	Sie yando i veruion rohta ná melie i nissi ve vére hroaltar. Ye mele verirya mele inse,
for no one ever hated his own flesh, but he gives it food and cherishes it , like the Christ also does to the congregation,	an úquen oi téve véra hráverya, mal antas san matso ar ná mára san, ve i Hristo yando care i ocomben,
for we are parts of his body.	an nalve rantali hroaryo.
“Therefore a man will leave his father and his mother, and he will stick to his wife, and the two will be one flesh.”	“Etta nér hehtuva atarya ar amillerya, ar himyuvas veriryanna, ar i atta nauvat hráve er.”
This mystery is great – I am speaking about Christ and the congregation.	Fóle sina túra ná – inye quéta pa Hristo yo i ocombe.
But it is necessary for everyone among you to love his wife as he loves himself, and it is necessary for the wife to have awe for her husband.	Mal mauya yando ilquenen mici le mele verirya ve melis inse, ar mauya i verin same áya veruryan.
Children, be obedient to your parents in the Lord, for that is just.	Híni, na canwacimye nostaruldant i Herusse, an ta faila ná.
“Give glory to your father and to your mother” – that is the first commandment that has a promise:	“Á anta alcar atarelyan ar amillelyan” – ta ná i minya axan ya same vanda:
“for you to be fortunate and for you to have a long life on earth”.	“návelyan herenya ar samieldan anda coivie cemende”.
And you, fathers, do not cause grief to your children, but raise them in the Lord's chastisement and instruction.	Ar elde, atari, áva tyare nyére hínaldain, mal áte orta mí Heruo paimesta ar peantie.
You slaves, be obedient to that are your lords in the flesh, in fear and in trembling, out of a whole heart, like to the Christ	A móli, na canwacimye in nar heruldar i hrávesse, mí rucie yo palie, et quanda endallo, ve i Hriston
– not like eye-servants, as if to please men, but like Christ's slaves, doing God's will sincerely.	– lá ve hendunúror, ve qui fastien atani, mal ve Hristo móli, cárala Eruo indóme holmo.
Be slaves that work with a willing mind, like to the Lord and not to men,	Na móli i molir mérala sámanen, ve i Herun ar lá atanin,
for you know that everyone, if he does anything good, shall receive back this deed from the Lord, not matter whether he is a slave or free.	an istalde i ilquen, qui caris aiqua mára, nancamuva carda sina i Herullo, lá címala qui náse mól hya léra.
And you lords , do the same things to them. Stop speaking threats, for you know that you and they alike have a Lord in heaven, and he does not heed faces .	Ar a heruvi, cara i imye nati tien. Á pusta quete lurwi, an istalde i elde ar té véla samir Heru menelde, ar sé ua cime cendeler.
Finally, be mighty in the Lord and in the might of his strength.	Teldave, na taure i Herusse ar i melehtesse poldoreryo.
Put on yourselves the protective gear of God, for you to stand against the Devil's tricks.	Á panya indesse i varyala sorosta Eruo, tarieltan i Arauco fintelennar.
For we fight, not against blood and against flesh, but against the lordships, against the powers, against the world-rulers in this darkness, against the wicked spirit-powers in heaven.	An elve mahtar, lá sercenna ar hrávenna, mal i hérennar, i túrennar, i mardoturinnar mornie sinasse, i olce fairetúrennar menelde.
Therefore lift up the protective gear of God, for you to be able to stand against the enemy on the evil day. Then, having completed everything, you will stand.	Etta á orta i varyala sorosta Eruo, polieldan tare i ñottonna i ulca auresse. Tá, téliéla ilqua, taruvalde.
Therefore stand firm, after binding the truth around your hips as a belt, and having the breast-plate of righteousness,	Etta tara tancave, apa nutie i nanwie os oşweldar ve quilta, ar arwe i ambasseo failiéva,
and bound around your feet with the prepared state that the gospel of peace gives.	ar nótine os taluldat i manwaina sómanen ya i evandilyon raineva anta.
Above everything take the shield of faith, with which you will be able extinguish all the burning arrows of the Wicked One,	Or ilqua á mapa i turma saviéva, yanen poluvalde luhtya ilye i Olco uryala pilindi,
and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of spirit, which is God's word,	ar á mapa i carma rehtiéva ar i macil faireva, ya Eruo quetta ná,
while you always pray in spirit with every prayer and petition. For that purpose be awake with all steadfastness and with petition on behalf of all the holy ones	íre illume hyamilde fairesse ilya hyamiénen ar arcandenen. Tana mehten na coive ilya voronwiénen ar arcandenen rá ilye i airin,
– also on my behalf, for me to receive words when I open my mouth, allowing me with boldness to make known the secret of the gospel,	– yando rá inyen, camienyan quettar íre pantan antonya, lávala nin veriénen care sinwa i evandilyono fóle,
for which I am an ambassador in fetters – for me to speak it boldly, as it is necessary for me to speak.	yan nanye ráquen mi naxali – quetienyan sa veryave, ve mauya nin quete.
To let also you know my matters, how I am doing, Tychicus – a beloved brother and a faithful servant in the Lord – will make everything known to you.	Lavien yando elden ista ninye nattor, manen cáran, Ticico – melda háno ar voronda núro i Herusse – caruva ilqua sinwa len.
I sent him to you for this purpose, for you to know our matters and for him to comfort your heart.	Mentanenyes lenna sina mehten, istieldan nattolmar ar tiutieryan endalda.
May the brothers have peace and love from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ!	Nai i hánor samuvar raine ar melme ho Eru i Atar ar i Heru Yésus Hristo!
May the grace be with all that love our Lord Jesus Christ with an immortal love!	Nai i lisse euva as illi i melir Herulva Yésus Hristo ilfirin melmenen!
Paul, apostle, not from men or through man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him out of dead,	Paulo, apostel, lá atanillon hya ter atan, mal ter Yésus Hristo ar Eru i Atar, ye ortane se et qualinillon,
and all the brothers with me, to the congregations in Galatia:	ar ilye i hánor asinye, i ocombennar Alatiasse:
May you have grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,	Nai samuvalde lisse ar raine ho Eru Atarelva ar i Heru Yésus Hristo,
who gave himself for our sins, for him to deliver us out of the wicked age that exists now, by the will of our God and our Father,	ye antane inse úcarelvain, etelehtieryan vi et i olca randallo ya ea sí, i indómenen Ainolvo ar Atarelvo,
to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.	yen na i alcar tennoio ar oi. Násie.
I am in wonder that so quickly you have been turned from who called you into the grace of Christ to another gospel.	Nanye elmendasse i ta lintave anaielde quérine yello le-yalle mir i Hristo lisse hyana evandilyonna.
But that is not another, but there are some people who stir you up and want to twist the gospel about the Christ.	Mal ta ua hyana, ono ear queneli i le-valtar ar merir rice i evandilyon pa i Hristo.
But also if we, or an angel from heaven, bring to you another gospel not like the gospel that we made known to you – may he be cursed!	Mal yando qui elme, hya vala menello, talar lenna hyana evandilyon lá ve i evandilyon ya carnelme sinwa len – nai nauvas húna!
As I have said before, now I say again: Anyone who brings to you a gospel beyond that you received, may he be cursed!	Ve equétien nóvo, sí quetin ata: Aiquen ye tala lenna evandilyon han ya camnelde, nai nauvas húna!
 to men I am now trying to show that I speak truth, or to God?	Ma sí atanin névan tana i quetin nanwie, hya Erun?
If I still made men happy, I were not Christ's slave.	Qui en carnen atani valime, únen Hristo mól.
For I let you know, brothers, that that gospel which was brought to you by me does not come from men,	An lavin len ista, hánor, i sana evandilyon ya náne talaina len lo ní ua tule atanillon,
for I did not receive it from man or was instructed in it, except by revelation from Jesus Christ.	an inye ua camne sa ho atan hya náne peantaina sasse, hequa apantiénen Yésus Hristollo.
For you have heard about my behavior in the past, how with vigour I persecuted God's congregation and tried to undo it,	An ahlárielde pa lengienya i vanwiesse, manen veassenen roitanen Eruo ocombe ar néve nancaritas,
and I went further in Judaism than numerous ones in my people that had the same number of years, being much more burning in spirit for the customs from the fathers.	ar lenden andave Yúrangolmesse epe rimbali lienyasse i sámer i imya nóte loaron, nála ole ambe uryala i fairesse i haimin i atarillon.
But when was pleasing to God, who brought me out of my mother's womb and called me with his grace,	Mal íre náne mára Erun, ye talle ni et amillinyo mónallo ar yalle ni lisseryanen,
to reveal his Son by me – for me to make the gospel about him known to the nations – I did not have a conversation with flesh and blood.	apanta Yondorya inyenen – carienyan i evandilyon pa sé sinwa i nórin – uan same artaquetie as hráve yo serce.
Furthermore, I did not go up to Jerusalem to those that were apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia, and I returned to Damascus.	Ente, uan lende ama Yerúsalemennna innar náner aposteli nó inye, mal lenden oa mir Aravia, ar nanwennen Lamascusenna.
Thereafter, after three years, I went up to Jerusalem to see Cephas, and I remained with him for fifteen days.	Epeta, apa loar nelde, lenden ama Yerúsalemenna velien Céfas, ar lemnen óse ter rí lepenque.
But I did not see anyone else among the apostles, but solely Jacob, the Lord's brother.	Mal uan velle aiquen hyana imíca i aposteli, mal eryave Yácov, i Heruo háno.
 that I am writing to you – look, before the eyes of God, I am not lying!	Yar técan len – yé, epe Eruo hendu, uan húra!
Thereafter I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.	Epeta lenden mir i ménar Sírio ar Cilicio.
But I was not known by face to the congregations in Judea in Christ;	Mal únen sinwa cendelénen i ocombin Yúreasse mi Hristo;
they only said: “The man who beforehand persecuted us now makes known the gospel that he tried to destroy formerly.”	eryave hlasselte: “I nér ye nóvo vi-roitane sí care sinwa i evandilyon ya néves nancare yá.”
And they gave glory to God concerning me.	Ar antanelte alcar Erun pa ní.
Therefore, after fourteen years, I went again up to Jerusalem with Barnabas, bringing also Titus.	Epeta, apa loar canaque, lenden ata ama Yerúsalemenna as Varnavas, tálala yando Títo.
But I went up after a revelation. And I told them about the gospel that I make known among the nations – but privately, before that were prominent men, fearing that in this or that manner I run or I have run for nothing.	Mal lenden ama apa apantie. Ar nyarnen tien pa i evandilyon ya carin sinwa imíca i nóri – mal vérave, epe i náner minde neri, rúcala i mi sina hya tana lé norin hya onórien muntan.
But nobody, also not Titus who was with me, was circumcised by compulsion, since he was a Greek.	Mal úquen, yando lá Títo ye nánen asinye, náne oscirna maustanen, pan anes Hellenya.
That happened by reason of the false brothers brought inside in silence, that came in secretly to spy on the freedom that we have by Jesus Christ, to make us thralls.	Ta martane castanen i úanwe hánoron talaine minna quildesse, i túler minna nuldave ettirien i lérie ya samilve Yésus Hristonen, vi-carieltan móli.
To them we did not allow to have their desire, not for a single moment – to cause the truth of the gospel to remain with you.	Tien ualme lave same írelta, lá erya lún – tyarien i evandilyono nanwie termare aselde.
But concerning the people that seemed to be important – the kind of people that they were formerly, is not important to me, for God does not heed a man's appearance – to me these important people told nothing new.	Mal pa i queni i şéner náve valde – i nostale quenion ya anelte yá, ua valda nin, an Eru ua cime atano ilce – inyen sine valde queni nyarner munta vinya.
On the contrary, when they saw how the gospel was placed in my keeping for me to bring it to the uncircumcized, like Peter had it for the circumcised ones –	Úsie, íre cennelte manen i evandilyon náne panyaina hepienyasse talienyan sa i úoscirnannar, ve Péter sáme sa i oscirnain –
for He who created in Peter the power of being an apostle for the circumcised, gave powers also to me for who are of the nations –	an Sé ye ontane Péteresse i túre náveo apostel i oscirnain, antane túreli yando inyen in nar i nórion –
and James and Cephas and John perceived the grace given to me, they that seemed to be pillars, then they gave me and Barnabas their hand of brotherhood: We were to go to the nations, but they to the circumcised ones.	ar Yácov ar Céfas ar Yohannes túner i lisse antaina nin, té i şéner náve tarmar, tá antanelte nin ar Varnavassen málta otornasseo: Emme menumnet i nórennar, mal té i oscirnannar.
Solely it was necessary for us to remember the poor ones, and that I have sincerely tried to do.	Eryave mauyane ment enyale i penyar, ar ta enévien care holmo.
But when Cephas came to Antioch, I stood against him face to face, for he stood judged.	Mal íre Céfas túle Antiocenna, tarnen senna cendelello cendelenna, an tarnes námina.
For before the coming of some men from James he ate with people of the nations, but when they came, he turned himself away and separated himself, fearing the circumcised ones.	An nó i tulesse nerelion Yácovello mantes as queni i nórion, mal íre túlelte, quernes inse oa ar ciltane inse, rúcala i oscirnallon.
The other Jews also followed him in hypocrisy, until also Barnabas was led away with them in their hypocrisy.	I hyane Yúrar yando hilyaner se imnetiesse, tenna yando Varnavas náne tulyaina oa aselte imnetieltasse.
But when I saw that they did not walk straight by the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas before them all: “If you, though you are a Jew, behaves like a person of the nations and does not like a Jew, how is that you compel people of the nations to follow the Jewish manner?”	Mal íre cennen i ualte vantane térave i nanwiénen i evandilyono, quenten Céfanna epe te illi: “Qui elye, ómu nalye Yúra, lenga ve quén i nórion ar laia ve Yúra, manen ná i elye mauya quenin i nórion hilya i Yúra lé?”
We by nature are Jews, and not sinners from the nations,	Elme nassenen nar Yúrar, ar lá úcarindor i nórellon,
and know a man will not receive justice by acts of Law, but solely by believing in Jesus Christ – also if we have believed in Jesus Christ in order to have justice by believing in Christ, and not by acts of Law. For is not flesh that will have justice by acts of Law.	ar istar atan ua samuva failie cardainen Şanyeo, mal eryave saviénen Hristo Yésusse – yando qui asávielve Yésus Hristosse samien failie saviénen Hristosse, ar lá cardainen Şanyeo. An ua ea hráve ya samuva failie cardainen Şanyeo.
But if we that seek to have justice by Christ are also found sinners, is Christ really sin's servant? By no means!	Mal qui elme i cestar same failie Hristonen nar yando hírine úcarindor, ma Hristo nanwave úcareo núro ná? Laume!
For if I build up the same things that I threw down, I show that I am a transgressor .	An qui carastan ama i imye nati yar hanten undu, tanan i nanye ongwemo.
For I by law died to law, for me to be alive to God.	An inye şanyenen qualle şanyen, návenyan coirea Erun.
I am crucified with Christ. I am alive, and yet that is not me, but Christ who is alive in me. The life that I now have in flesh, I have by believing in God's son, he who has loved me and has given himself for me.	Nanye tarwestaina as Hristo. Nanye coirea, ananta ta ua ní, mal Hristo ye ná coirea nisse. I coivie ya sí samin hrávesse, samin i saviénen yondosse Eruo, sé ye emélie ni ar ánie inse inyen.
I do not put away God's grace, for if is justice by law, the Christ actually died for nothing.	Uan panya oa Eruo lisse, an qui failie ea şanyenen, i Hristo anwave qualle muntan.
O stupid Galatians, who has enchanted you, you before whose eyes Christ was shown crucified as if by a picture?	A lamanwe Atatyar, man uluhtie le, elde epe ion hendu Hristo náne tanaina tarwestaina ve emmanen?
This thing alone I want to learn from you: Did you receive the Spirit by acts of law or by hearing in faith?	Sina nat erinqua merin pare lello: Ma camnelde i Faire cardainen şanyeo hya hláriénen mi savie?
Are you that stupid? After you had your beginning in spirit, are you now completed in flesh?	Ma nalde ta lamanwe? Apa sámelde yestalda fairesse, ma sí nalde telyaine hrávesse?
Did you suffer that many things for nothing? If indeed it happened for nothing.	Ma perpérelde ta rimbe nati muntan? Qui é martanes muntan.
Therefore, he who gives you the Spirit and does mighty acts among you, is his reason for doing so acts of law, or hearing by faith?	Etta, sé ye anta len i Faire ar care taure cardali mici le, ma castarya carien sie cardar şanyeo, hya hlarie saviénen?
In the same manner Abraham “believed in the Lord, and that was counted to him as justice”.	Mi imya lé Avraham “sáve i Hérusse, ar ta náne nótina sen ve failie”.
Indeed you know that they who adhere to faith, they are Abraham's sons.	É istalde i té i himyar savie, té nar Avrahámo yondor.
But the Scripture, foreseeing that God by faith was going to justify people from the nations, made the gospel known beforehand to Abraham: “By you all the nations will be blessed.”	Mal i Tehtele, apacénala i Eru saviénen failatumne queneli i nórion, carne i evandilyon sinwa nóvo Avrahámen: “Elyenen ilye i nóri nauvar aistane.”
Thus who adhere to faith are blessed with Abraham the Faithful.	Sie i himyar savie nar aistane as Avraham i Sarta.
For all who adhere to acts of Law are under a curse, for is written: “Cursed is everyone who does not remain in all the things written in the book of the Law, in order to do them.”	An illi i himyar cardar Şanyeo nar nu hútie, an ná técina: “Húna ná ilquen ye ua termare mi ilye i nati técine i parmasse i Şanyeo, carien tai.”
That nobody is made just before God is easily seen, for “the just one will have life by faith”.	I úquen ná carna faila epe Eru aşcénima ná, an “i faila samuva coivie saviénen”.
The Law does not adhere to faith, but “ who does them will have life by them”.	I Şanye ua himya savie, mal “ye care tai samuva coivie tainen”.
The Christ traded us to himself out of the curse of the Law by being made a curse in our place, for is written: “Cursed is everyone hanging on a cross.”	Hristo vi-mancane insen et i hútiello i Şanyeo návenen carna hútie nómelvasse, an ná técina: “Húna ná ilquen lingala tarwesse.”
Thus the blessing which Abraham received was going to come to the nations by Jesus Christ, for us to receive by faith the spirit of which we have a promise.	Sie i aistie ya Avraham camne tulumne i nórennar Yésus Hristonen, camielvan saviénen i faire pa ya samilve vanda.
Brothers, I speak to you by the manner of men: After a covenant has been established, nobody puts it away or adds to it, though it is a man's covenant.	Hánor, quetin i lénen atanion: Apa vére anaie tulcaina, úquen panya sa oa hya napane sanna, ómu nás atano vére.
But to Abraham the promises were given, and to his seed. It does not say 'and to his seeds', as if are numerous ones, but as if is one: 'And to your seed,' who is the Christ.	Mal Avrahámen i vandar náner quétina, ar erderyan. Sa ua quete 'ar erderyain', ve qui ear rimbeli, mal ve qui ea er: 'Ar eldelyan,' ye ná i Hristo.
Furthermore, I say: Concerning the promise beforehand established by God, the Law that came four hundred and thirty years after it does not make it void, undoing the promise.	Ente, quetin: Pa i vanda nóvo tulcaina lo Eru, i Şanye ya túle loar nelequean ar tuxi cantar apa sa ua sa-care lusta, nancárala i vanda.
For if our part as heirs comes by Law, it does not hang on a promise, but to Abraham God has given it by a promise.	An qui rantalva ve aryoni tule Şanyenen, uas en linga vandanen, mal Avrahámen Eru ánie sa vandanen.
Then for what reason did the Law exist? It was added to make crimes easily seen, until coming of the seed to whom the promise has been made, for it was given through angels, by an intermediary's hand.	Tá mana castan i Şanye enge? Anes napánina carien ongwi aşcénime, tenna tulesse i erdeo yen i vanda anaie carna, ar anes antaina ter valali, enelmo mánen.
But is no intermediary where is one alone, but God is one.	Mal ua ea enelmo yasse ea er erinqua, mal Eru ná er.
Does the Law then stand against God's promises? By no means! For if a law was given that could give life, indeed was justice by law.	Ma i Şanye tá tare ana Eruo vandar? Laume! An qui şanye náne antaina ya polle anta coivie, é enge failie şanyenen.
But the Scripture put all things together in custody of sin, and so the promise that comes from faith will be given to that believe.	Mal i Tehtele panyane ilye nati uo i mandosse úcareo, ar sie i vanda ya tule saviello nauva antaina in savir.
But before the faith came, we were under oversight under law, being in custody together, until the faith that was to come was revealed.	Mal nó i savie túle, anelme ortíriesse nu şanye, nála mandosse uo, tenna i savie ya tulumne náne apantaina.
Thus the Law instructed us and led us to Christ, for us to be made just by faith.	Sie i Şanye vi-peantane ar vi-tulyane Hristonna, návelvan cárine faile saviénen.
But now when faith has come, we are no more under an instructor.	Mal sí íre savie utúlie, ualve ambe nu peantar.
For all among you are sons of God by your faith in Jesus Christ.	An illi mici le nar yondoli Eruo savieldanen Yésus Hristosse.
For all you that were baptized into Christ has put Christ on yourselves.	An ilye elde i náner tumyaine mir Hristo apánier Hristo indesse.
 is not Jew or Greek, is not thrall or free person, is not man or woman; for you are all one, in Jesus Christ.	Ua ea Yúra hya Hellenya, ua ea mól hya léra quén, ua ea nér hya nís; an nalde illi er, Hristo Yésusse.
Therefore, if you are the Christ's, indeed you are Abraham's seed, heirs by the promise.	Ente, qui nalde i Hristova, é nalde Avrahámo erde, aryoni i vandanen.
Now I say that while the heir is a babe he is in nothing better than a thrall, though he is lord of all things.	Sí quetin i íre i aryon ná lapse náse muntasse arya lá mól, ómu náse heru ilye nation.
He is under stewards until the day that his father chose beforehand.	Náse nu mardili tenna i aure ya atarya cille nóvo.
In the same manner also we, while we were babes, were thralls of the poor things of the world.	Mí imya lé yando elve, íre anelve lapsi, náner móli i penye nation i mardo.
But when the full time came, God sent forth his Son, born by a woman, born under Law,	Mal íre i quanta lúme túle, Eru etementane Yondorya, nóna lo nís, nóna nu Şanye,
for him to trade that were under Law to himself, freeing them. Thus is it possible for us as well to receive a place as his sons.	mancieryan i náner nu Şanye insen, leryala te. Sie yando elven ece came nóme ve yondoryar.
But since you are sons, God sent his Son's spirit into our heart, crying: “Abba, Father!”	Mal pan nalde yondor, Eru mentane Yondoryo faire mir endalva, yámala: “Appa, Atar!”
Thus you are no more a thrall, but a son; and if a son, also an heir through God.	Sie ual ambe mól, mal yondo; ar qui yondo, yando aryon ter Eru.
And yet, when you did not know God, you were thralls for those that are not by nature gods.	Ananta, íre ualde sinte Eru, anelde móli in uar nassenen ainor.
But now, after you knew God – or better said, now that you were known by God – how is that you turn yourselves back towards the weak and poor things and wish to be thralls to them again?	Mal sí, apa sintelde Eru – hya ambe mai quétina, sí íre anaielde sinwe lo Eru – manen ná i nanquerilde inde i milye ar penye natinnar ar merir náve móli tain ata?
You keep days and months and times and years.	Hepilde auri ar astar ar lúmi ar loar.
I fear that in this or that manner I have worked for nothing among you.	Rucin i mi sina hya tana lé omólien muntan mici le.
Brothers, I ask of you: Be like me, for I was also like you! You did nothing bad to me.	Hánor, arcan lello: Na ve inye, an anen yando ve lé! Carnelde munta raica nin.
But you know how because of a sickness in my flesh I made the gospel known to you at the first time.	Mal istalde manen hlívenen hrávenyasse carnen i evandilyon sinwa len mí minya lú.
And which was a test to you in my flesh you did not despise or spat upon it, but like an angel of God you received me, like Christ Jesus.	Ar ya náne tyastie len hrávenyasse ualde nattirne hya piutane sanna, mal ve Eru vala camnelde ni, ve Hristo Yésus.
Where, then, is the joy that you had? For I am a witness to you that if that were possible, you cut out your own eyes to give them to me.	Masse, tá, ea i alasse ya sámelde? An nanye astarmo len i qui ta náne cárima, hocirnelde vére henduldat antien tu nin.
As if I am now your enemy since I am telling you the truth?	Ve qui nanye sí cotumolda pan nyáran len i nanwie?
They seek you with a burning desire, not for good, but they want to cut you away from me, for you to seek them with a burning desire.	Cestalte le uryala írenen, lá márien, mal merilte cire le oa nillo, cestieldan té uryala írenen.
But it is good to be sought for a good reason, and not solely when I am with you,	Mal mára ná náve cestaina mára castan, ar lá eryave íre ean aselde,
my children, for whom I again have sharp pains until Christ shall be formed in you.	hínanyar, in ata samin naiceli tenna Hristo nauva cátina lesse.
But it is possible for me to wish that I were there with you now, to speak with you in another manner, for I do not know what I am to do concerning you.	Mal ece nin mere i engen tasse aselde sí, quetien aselde mi hyana lé, an uan ista mana caruvan pa le.
Tell me, you that wish to be under law: Do you not hear the Law?	Nyara nin, elde i merir náve nu şanye: Ma ualde hlare i Şanye?
For it is written that there were two sons with Abraham, one by the servant woman and one by the free woman.	An ná técina i enget yondo atta as Avraham, er i núrenen ar er i léra nissenen.
But that was by the servant woman was born in the manner of the flesh, but the other by the free woman, by a promise.	Ono ye enge i núrenen náne nóna mí lé i hráveo, mal i exe lo i léra nís, vandanen.
They are a picture of coming things. For these women are two covenants. The first is from Mount Sinai, which bears children into thralldom, and which is Hagar.	Tai nar emma túlala nation. An nissi sine nar vére atta. I minya ná ho Oron Sínai, ya cole híni mólienna, ar ya ná Háhar.
Now this Hagar is Sinai, a mountain in Arabia, and it is a picture of the Jerusalem which exists now, for she is in thralldom with her children.	Sí Háhar sina ná Sínai, oron mi Aravia, ar náse emma i Yerúsalémo ya ea sí, an náse móliesse as hínaryar.
But Jerusalem on High is free, and she is our mother.	Mal Yerúsalem Tarmende ná léra, ar sé amillelva ná.
For it is written: “Be happy, O woman who did not bear a child; have joy and cry out , you who did not have pain of birth! For the unfruitful woman's children are more numerous than the children of the woman who had the husband.”	An ná técina: “Na valima, a nís ye ua colle hína; sama alasse ar yama, elye ye ua sáme naice nóniéva! An i yávelóra nisso híni nar rimbe lá i híni i nisso ye sáme i veru.”
But you, brothers, are children by the promise, as was Isaac.	Mal elve, hánor, nar híni i vandanen, ve náne Ísac.
But as who was born in the manner of the flesh persecuted who was born in the manner of spirit, so also now.	Mal tambe ye náne nóna mí lé hráveo roitane ye náne nóna mí lé faireo, síve yando sí.
But what does the Scripture say? “Send away the slavegirl and her son, for the slavegirl's son will by no means be an heir with the free woman's son.”	Ono mana i Tehtele quete? “Á menta oa i núre ar yondorya, an i núreo yondo laume nauva aryon as i léra nisso yondo.”
For into such freedom the Christ freed us. Therefore stand firm, and do not allow yourselves to be kept under a thrall's yoke.	An mir taite lérie i Hristo leryane ve. Etta tara tulce, ar áva lave inden náve hépine nu yanta mólo.
Behold! I, Paul, am telling you that if you are circumcised, Christ will not be of benefit to you.	Yé! Inye, Paulo, nyára len i qui nalde oscírine, Hristo ua nauva aşea len.
Furthermore, I witness again to everyone who is circumcised that he has the obligation of keeping the entire Law.	Ente, vettan ata ilquenen ye ná oscírina i samis i rohta hepiéva i quanda Şanye.
You are split from Christ, you who try to be made just by the Law; out of the grace you have fallen.	Nalde şance Hristollo, elde i nevir náve cárine faile i Şanyenen; et i Erulissello alantielde.
For we by spirit look forward to the righteousness by faith concerning which we have hope.	An elme fairenen yétar ompa i failienna saviénen pa ya samilme estel.
For in Jesus Christ circumcision and uncircumcision alike cannot do anything, but faith by love can.	An Hristo Yésusse oscirie ar úoscirie véla uar pole care aiqua, mal savie melmenen pole.
You ran well. What stopped you from following the truth still?	Nornelde mai. Mana pustane le hiliello i nanwie en?
You are not so induced by who called you.	Ualde sie şahtaine lo ye yalle le.
A small sourdough makes the whole lump swell.	Pitya pulmaxe pulta i quanda luppo.
I am certain concerning you that are in Christ that you do not think in another manner, but he who is causing difficulty for you will carry his judgement, not heeding who he is.	Nanye tanca pa elde i nar i Herusse i ualde sanuva mi hyana lé, mal sé ye tyára hrangie len coluva námierya, lá címala man náse.
And concerning me, brothers, if I am still preaching circumcision, what is the reason for pursuing me? Then the off-putting thing of the cross has been made empty.	Ar pa ní, hánor, qui en nyardean oscirie, mana i casta roitien ni? Tá i auquérala nat i tarweo anaie carna lusta.
I wish that those that stir you up will cut off the whole thing!	Merin i té i valtar le ciruvar oa i quanda nat!
For you were called into freedom, brothers; solely do not use this freedom to give an opportunity to the flesh, but by love be thralls one for the other.	An anelde yáline mir lérie, hánor; eryave áva yuhta lérie sina antien ecie i hráven, mal melmenen na móli quén i exen.
For the sum of the whole Law is one saying: “Love your neighbor as yourself.”	An i quanda Şanyeo nonwe ná er quetiesse: “Mela armarolya ve imle.”
But if you bite and consume one another, take heed that you are not destroyed one by the other!	Mal qui nacilde ar ammatir quén i exe, cima i ualde nar nancárine quén lo i exe!
But I say: Walk by spirit, and you will by no means follow the desire of the flesh!	Mal quetin: Á vanta fairenen, ar laume hilyuvalde i hráveo íre!
For the flesh stands against the spirit by its desire, and the spirit against the flesh; for they are hostile, one against the other, to stop you from doing that you wish.	An i hráve tare i fairenna íreryasse, ar i faire i hrávenna; an natte cotye, er i exenna, pustien le cariello yar merilde.
But if you are led by spirit, you are not under law.	Mal qui nalde tulyaine fairenen, ualde nu şanye.
The deeds of the flesh are easily seen, and they are fornication, uncleanness, loose conduct,	I hráveo cardar nar aşcénine, ar nalte hrupuhtie, úpoicie, lehta lengie,
idol-worship, sorcery, strife, fighting, burning feeling, anger, quarrels, splits, divided orders,	cordontyerie, ñúle, cos, mahtie, uryala felme, rúşe, costier, şancier, ciltaine hereni,
envy, drunkenness, over-drinkings and their likes. About these things I tell you about the danger beforehand, as I also told you formerly: who do such things will not be heirs of the kingdom of God.	hrúcen, limpunquie, accasucier ar vávealtar. Pa nati sine nyarin len pa i raxe nóvo, ve yando nyarnen len yá: I carir taiti nati uar nauva aryoni i araniéno Eruo.
But the fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, grace, goodness, faith,	Mal i faireo yáve ná melme, alasse, raine, cóle, lisse, márie, savie,
gentleness, self-control. Against such things is no law.	moicie, immoturie. Ana taiti nati ua ea şanye.
Furthermore, those who are of Chrsit Jesus have crucified the flesh with its lusts and desires.	Ente, i nar Hristo Yésuo atarwestie i hráve as maileryar ar íreryar.
If we have life by spirit, let us also walk by the spirit.	Qui samilve coivie fairenen, yando alve vanta i fairenen.
Let us not seek empty glory, stirring one another up, having envy one towards the other.	Ávalve cesta cumna alcar, valtala quén i exe, arwe hrúceno quén i exenna.
Brothers, if a person makes this or that mistake, show him the right way in a gentle manner, you who are of the spirit, while everyone among you watches himself, or maybe you too will be tempted.	Hánor, qui quén care sina hya tana loima, á tana sen i téra malle mi moica lé, elde i nar i faireo, íre ilquen mici le tire inse, hya cé yando elde nauvar úşahtaine.
Carry one another's burdens, and so follow the Christ's law.	Cola quén i exeo cólar, ar sie á hilya i Hristo şanye.
For if a person thinks that he is important when he is nothing, he tells a lie to himself.	An qui quén sana i náse valda íre náse munta, nyaris huru insen.
But may everyone examine his own work, and then he will have his reason for joy in that which he himself has done, not comparing himself to another person.	Mal nai ilquen ceşe véra molierya, ar tá samuvas castarya alassen mi ta ya sé acárie, lá sestala inse as hyana quén.
For everyone will carry his own burden.	An ilquen coluva véra cólarya.
Furthermore, may who learns the word allow who instructs him to have a part in all good things.	Ente, nai ye pare i quetta lavuva yen peanta sen same ranta mi ilye máre nati.
Do not err: One may not speak mockery against God. For which a man sows, that he shall also reap,	Áva ranya: Mo ua lerta quete yaiwe Erunna. An ya nér rere, ta yando cirihtuvas,
for who sows in his flesh shall reap destruction from his flesh, but who sows in the spirit shall reap eternal life from the spirit.	an ye rere hráveryasse cirihtuva nancarie hráveryallo, mal ye rere i fairesse cirihtuva oira coivie i fairello.
Therefore let us not be tired and stop doing what is good, for when the time shall come, we will reap if we do not wear out.	Etta ávalve na lumbe ar pusta care ya mára ná, an íre i lúme tuluva, cirihtuvalme qui ualve yerya.
Truly, when we have an opportunity, may we do good to everyone, and above all to that are our kin in the faith.	Nanwave, íre samilve ecie, nai caruvalve márie ilquenen, ar or ilqua in nar nosselva i saviesse.
Behold the big letters that I have written to you with my own hand!	Ela i hoe tengwar yar etécien len véra mányanen!
 who want to compel you to be circumcised are that wish to make the flesh beautiful, wishing to escape persecution because of the cross of the Christ.	I merir mauya le náve oscírine nar i merir care i hráve vanima, mérala uşe roitie i Hristo tarwenen.
For that are circumcised, they do not keep the Law, but they wish that you too will be circumcised, for them to have a reason to praise themselves concerning your flesh.	An i nar oscírine, té uar hepe i Şanye, mal merilte i yando elde nauvar oscírine, samieltan casta laitien inte pa hrávelda.
May I not ever praise myself, except by the cross of Jesus Christ, by whom the world has been crucified for me, and I for the world.	Nai inye ua oi laituva imne, hequa i tarwenen Yésus Hristo, yenen i mar anaie atarwestaina inyen, ar inye i marden.
For what is important is not circumcision or uncircumcision, but to be a new creature.	An ya ná valda ua oscirie hya úoscirie, mal náve vinya onna.
All that want to walk by this rule of conduct, to them be peace and grace, and to the God of Israel.	Illi i merir vanta sina şanyenen lengiéva, tien na raine ar lisse, ar Israélo Ainon.
From now may no one cause me difficulty, for I am carrying in my flesh the marks of Jesus Christ.	Ho sí nai úquen tyaruva nin urdie, an cólan hroanyasse i tanwar Yésus Hristova.
May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen!	Nai Herulva Yésus Hristo lisse euva as fairelda, hánor. Násie!
God, who long ago at numerous occasions and in numerous manners spoke to our fathers by the prophets,	Eru, ye andanéya mi rimbe lúli ar mi rimbe léli quente atarilvannar i Erutercánoinen,
has at the end of these days spoken to us by a Son, whom he has appointed heir of all things, and through whom he has made the Universe.	i mettasse sine aurion equétie venna Yondonen, ye asáties aryon ilye nation, ar ter ye acáries Ea.
He is a ray of his glory and an image of his true-being, bearing all things by the power of his word, and after making a cleansing of our sins he sat down to the right of the Majesty on high.	Náse alca alcareryo ar emma nasseryo, cólala ilye nati quettaryo túrenen, ar apa carie poitie úcarelvaiva hamnes undu i Meletyo foryasse tarmenissen.
Thus he has been made greater than angels, being heir to a name more glorious than their name.	Sie anaies carna túra epe vali, nála aryon esseo alcarinqua epe esselta.
"For to whom among angels has he ever said: ""You are my son; I begat you today"" – ? And again: ""I shall be his father, and he shall be my son."""	"An manenna mici vali oi equéties: ""Elye ná yondonya; ónen tye síra"" – ? Ar ata: ""Inye nauva atarya, ar sé nauva yondonya."""
"But when he again sends his Only-begotten into the world, he says: ""And may all God's angels worship him!"""	"Mal íre ata mentas Ernónarya mir ambar, quetis: ""Ar nai ilye Eruo vali tyeruvar se!"""
"And concerning the angels he says: ""He makes his angels spirits, and those who work for him, a fire of flame."""	"Ar pa i vali quetis: ""Caris valaryar faireli, ar i molir sen, ruine náreva."""
"But concerning the Son: ""God is your throne forever and ever, and your kingdom's staff is a staff of uprightness"" ."	"Mal pa i Yondo: ""Eru ná mahalmalya tennoio ar oi, ar aranielyo vandil ná vandil tériéva."
You have loved righteousness, and you have hated lawlessness.	Eméliel failie, ar etéviel şanyelórie.
"Therefore God, your Deity, has annointed you with oil, more than your companions."""	"Etta Eru, Ainolya, ilívie lye millonen, ambe lá sartolyar."""
"And, ""In the beginning, o Lord, you founded earth, and heaven is an artifact of your hands."	"Ar, ""I yestasse, a Heru, elye tulcane cemen, ar menel ná taman mályato."
They will pass away, but you remain; and they will both wear out like a cloak,	Tú autuvat, mal elye termare; ar yúyo yeryuvatte ve colla,
"and like a raiment you will roll them up, like a cloak, and they will be changed. But you are the same, and your years will not stop."""	"ar ve larma tu-tolúval, ve colla, ar nauvatte vistaine. Mal elye i imya ná, ar loalyar uar pustuva."""
"But concerning whom among angels has he ever said: ""Sit by my right hand until I place your enemies as a support for your feet."""	"Mal pa man mici vali oi equéties: ""Hama ara formanya tenna panyan ñottolyar ve tulco talulyant."""
Are they all among them servant-spirits, sent to serve those that will be heirs of salvation?	Ma uar illi mici te núrofaireli, mentaine vevien in nauvar aryoni rehtiéno?
For this reason it is necessary to profoundly heed that we have heard, to stop us from ever drifting away.	Sina castanen mauya tumnave cime yar ahlárielve, vi-pustien oi luttiello oa.
For if the word spoken through angels has been true, and every crime and failing to heed a commandment received a just punishment,	An qui i quetta quétina ter valali anaie nanwa, ar ilya ongwe ar loitie cime axan camner faila paimetie,
how will we flee if we have failed to heed a salvation so great? In the beginning it was spoken by our Lord, and it was established for ourselves by that heard him,	manen uşuvalve qui oloitielve cime rehtie ta túra? I yestasse anes quétina lo Herulva, ar anes tulcaina elven lo i hlasser se,
when also God witnessed by means of signs and wonders and mighty doings and by distributions of holy spirit, as his will was.	íre yando Eru vettane tanwalínen ar elmendalínen ar taure carielínen ar etsatielínen aire feava, ve indómerya náne.
For not under angels he has put the world that is going to come, of which we are speaking.	An lá nu vali apánies i ambar ya tuluva, pa ya quétalve.
"But in a place someone has witnessed, saying: ""What is man, for you to recall him, or a son or man, for you to heed him?"	"Mal mi nóme quén evettie, quétala: ""Mana atan, enyalielyan se, hya atanyondo, cimielyan se?"
You have placed him a little under angels, you gave him a crown of glory and of honor; and you put him over the works of your hands.	Apánielyes pityave nu vali; antanel sen ríe alcarwa ar laitiéva; ar panyanelyes or mályato tamani.
All things you have put under his feet. For when God put all things under him, there is nothing that he allowed to be beyond his power. Now we still do not see all things put under him .	"Ilye nati apániel nu talyat."" An íre Eru panyane ilye nati nu sé, ea munta yan láves náve han túrerya. Sí en ualve cene ilye nati panyaine nu sé."
But we do look at Jesus, who was made a little under angels, having a crown of glory and honor after he went through death, for him to taste death for every person, by God's grace.	Mal é yétalve Yésus, ye náne carna pityave nu vali, arwa ríeo alcarwa ar laitiéno apa lendes ter qualme, tyavieryan qualme ilya quenen, Eruo lissenen.
It seemed good to him for whom all things exist and through whom everything exists, when he was bringing many sons to glory, to make the Chief of their salvation perfect through suffering.	Náne mára sen yen ilye nati ear ar ter ye ilqua ea, íre tulyumnes rimbe yondoli alcarenna, care i Cáno rehtielto ilvana ter perperiéli.
And that hallows and that are hallowed all come from One, and for this reason he is not ashamed about calling them brothers,	An ye airita ar i nar airinte illi tulir ho Er, ar sina castanen uas naityana pa estie te hánor,
"as he says: ""I shall preach your name to my brothers; in the midst of the congregation I shall praise you with song."""	"ve quetis: ""Nyarduvan esselya hánonyain; i ocombeo endesse lye-laituvan lírinen."""
"And again: ""I shall put my name on him."" And again: ""Behold, I and the children that God has given me!"""	"Ar ata: ""Panyuvan estelinya sesse."" Ar ata: ""Yé, inye ar i híni i nin-ánie Eru!"""
Since the children have part in flesh and blood, he as well received a part in them , by death undoing that had the power to cause death, that is, the Devil,	Pan i híni samir ranta mi hráve yo serce, yando sé mi imya lé camne ranta mi tú, qualmenen nancárala ye sáme i túre tyarien qualme, ta ná, i Arauco,
and delivering all that by fear of death were slaves in their entire life.	ar etelehtien illi i caurenen qualmeva náner móli quanda coivieltasse.
For he does not help angels, but Abraham's kin he helps.	An uas manya vali, mal Avrahámo nossen manyas.
Therefore it was necessary for him to be like his brothers in all things, for him to be a merciful and faithful chief priest, to sacrifice guilt-offerings about the sins of the people.	Etta mauyane sen náve ve hánoryar ilye natisssen, náveryan órávala ar voronda héra airimo, yacien cámayancali pa i lieo úcari.
And since he has had sufferings when he was tested, he can help that are tested.	An pan sé asámie perperiéli íre anes tyastaina, polis manya i nar tyastaine.
Therefore, holy brothers who have a part in the calling to heaven, give heed to the apostle and chief priest that we confess – Jesus.	Etta, airi hánor i samir ranta i yaliénó menelenna, cima i apostel ar héra airimo ye etequentalve – Yésus.
He was faithful to the one who made him so, as was also Moses in all the house of that Person.	Anes voronda yen se-carne sie, ve náne yando Móses quanda coasse tana Quenwa.
For he is counted worthy of a glory greater than that of Moses, since who has built a house has an honor greater that which the house has.	An sé ná nótina valda alcaro túra lá ta Móseo, pan ye acarastie coa same laitie túra lá ya i coa same.
For every house is built by someone, but who has built all things is God.	An ilya coa ná carastaina lo quén, mal ye acarastie ilye nati ná Eru.
For Moses as a servant was faithful in all the house of that Person, as a witness of things of which one was to speak afterwards,	Ar Móses ve núro náne voronda i quanda coasse tana Quenwa, ve vettie natalion pa yar mo quetumne epeta,
but Jesus was faithful as Son in the house of that Person.	mal Yésus náne voronda ve Yondo i coasse tana Quenwa.
"Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says: ""Today if you listen to his voice,"	"Etta, ve i Aire Fea quete: ""Síra qui lastalde ómaryanna,"
do not make your heart hard, as when people caused bitter anger on the day of test in the wilderness,	áva care endalda hranga, ve íre queni tyarner sára rúşe i auresse tyastiéva i erumesse,
when your father tempted me with a test, after they saw my works for forty years.	íre atarildar ni-şahtaner tyastiénen, apa cennelte cardanyar ter loar canaquean.
Therefore I loathed this generation and said: Always they stray in their heart, and they have not known my ways.	Etta feuyanen nónare sina ar quente: Illume ranyalte endaltasse, ar té uar isintier tienyar.
"Thus I spoke an oath in my heart: They shall not come into my rest!"""	"Sie quenten vanda endanyasse: Ualte tuluva mir sérenya!"""
Watch yourselves, my brothers, to stop anyone among you from having a wicked heart without faith, causing you to abandon the living God.	Tira inde, hánonyar, pustien aiquen mici le oi samiello olca enda ú saviéno, tyárala le hehta i coirea Eru.
"But encourage one another, every day while there is still that which one calls ""today"", to stop anyone among you from being made hard by the temptation of sin."	"Mal á horta quén i exe, ilya auresse íre en ea ya mo esta ""síra"", pustien aiquen mici le návello carna sarda i úşahtiénen úcareo."
For we have had a part with the Christ. All we need is that we keep until the end the foundation that we had in the beginning.	An asámielve ranta as i Hristo. Erya maurelva ná i hepilve tenna i tyel i talma ya sámelve i yestasse.
"When is said: ""Today, if you listen to his voice, do not make your heart hard, as when people caused bitter anger"""	"Íre ná quétina: ""Síra, qui lastalde ómaryanna, áva care endalda hranga, ve íre queni tyarner sára rúşe"""
– who were the people that listened, and yet caused bitter anger? Were the one that did so not all that went out of Egypt, led by Moses?	– man náner i queni i lastaner, ananta tyarner sára rúşe? Ma i carner sie uar náne illi i lender et Mirrandorello, tulyaine lo Móses?
Furthermore, whom did God loathe throughout forty years? Were they not the ones that sinned, the people whose corpses fell in the desert?	Ente, man Eru feuyane ter loar canaquean? Ma ualte náne i úcarner, i queni ion loicor lantaner i erumesse?
The people to whom by oath he refused to come into his peace, who were they, if not that failed to heed his commands?	I queni in vandanen váquentes tule mir sérerya, man anelte, qui lá i loitaner cime canwaryar?
Thus we see that they might not come in because of lack of faith.	Sie cenilve i ualte lertane tule minna peniénen saviéva.
Therefore, since a promise remains about coming into his rest, let us fear, for it seems that among you there are some that have fallen short of it.	Etta, pan vanda lemya pa tulie mir sérerya, alve ruce, an şéya i míci le ear queneli i oloitier sa.
For the gospel was brought to us and to them alike, but the word that they heard did nothing beneficial for them, for they were not united by faith with the ones that listened.	An i evandilyon náne tulúna venna ar téna véla, mal i quetta ya hlasselte carne munta aşea tien, an ualte náne ertaine saviénen as i lastaner.
"For we that have believed indeed come into the rest, just as he has said: ""This oath I gave in my anger: They shall not come into my rest"" – though his works were completed from the founding of the world."	"An elve i asávier é tulir mir i sére, aqua ve equéties: ""Vanda sina antanen rúşenyasse: Ualte tuluva mir sérenya"" – ómu cardaryar náner telyaine tulciello i mardeva."
"For in place he has said about the seventh day: ""And God rested on the seventh day from all his works"","	"An mi nóme equéties i pa i otsea aure: ""Ar Eru sende i otsea auresse ilye cardaryallon"","
"and again in this place: ""They shall not come into my peace."""	"ar ata mi nóme sina: ""Ualte tuluva mir sérenya."""
Therefore, since are still some people that will come into it, and the ones that received the gospel in the beginning did not come into it because of failing to heed his commands,	Etta, pan ear en queneli i tuluvar mir sa, ar i camner i evandilyon i yestasse uar túle mir sa loitiénen cime canwaryar,
"again he indicates a day, by saying after a long time in David's song: ""Today"" – as he said formerly – ""Today, if you hear his voice, do not make your heart hard!"""	"ata teas aure, quetiénen apa anda lúme Laviro lírisse: ""Síra"" – ve quentes yá – ""Sira, qui hlarilde ómarya, áva care endalda hranga!"""
For if Joshua led them to a place of rest, God would not speak thereafter about another day.	An qui Yosua te-tulyane nómenna séreva, Eru lá quetumne epeta pa hyana aure.
Indeed there will still be a sabbath-rest for God's people.	É euva en sendare-sére Eruo lien.
For who has come into God's rest, has also rested from his works, as God did from his own.	An ye utúlie mir Eruo sére, yando esérie cardaryallon, ve Eru carne véraryallon.
Therefore, let us do everything that we can to come into that rest, to stop anyone from falling in the same manner: by failing to heed the commands.	Etta, alve care ilqua ya polilve tulien mir sére tana, pustien aiquen lantiello mi imya lé: loitiénen cime i canwar.
For God's word is alive and carries power, and it is sharper than any double-edged sword, piercing until it divides soul and spirit, bones and marrow, and can perceive the heart's thoughts and ideas.	An Eruo quetta ná coirea ar cole túre, ar nas aica epe ilya yúmaicea macil, térala tenna ciltas fea ar faire, axor ar axende, ar pole tunta i endo sanwi ar incar.
For there is not creature that is not seen by him, but all things are naked and open to his eyes, he to whom it is necessary for us to answer.	Ar ua ea onna ya ua cénina lo sé, mal ilye nati nar helde ar pantaine henyant, sé yenna mauya ven hanquete.
Therefore, seeing that we have a mighty chief priest who has gone through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us keep our confession .	Etta, cénala i samilve túra héra airimo ye elendie ter i meneli, Yésus i Eruion, nai hépalve etequentielva.
For we have as a chief priest, not a person who does not know to have sympathy when we are weak, but a person who has ben tested in every manner as are we, but without sin.	An samilve ve héra airimo, lá quén ye ua ista same ofelme aselve íre nalve milye, mal quén ye anaie tyastaina mi ilya lé ve nar elve, mal ú úcareo.
Therefore may we come to the throne of grace having courage, to receive mercy and to find a grace helping us in our time of need.	Etta nai tuluvalve i mahalmanna Erulisseva arwa huoreo, camien oravie ar hirien lisse vi-manyala lúmelvasse maureva.
For every chief priest taken from among men is put on behalf of men over God's things, to sacrifice gifts and sacrifices concerning sins.	An ilya héra airimo mapaina ho mici atani ná panyaina rá atanin or nati Eruva, yacien annar ar yancar pa úcari.
He knows to behave gently to who lack knowledge and are errant, since he as well always perceives his own weak state,	Istas lenga milyave in penir istya ar nar ránie, pan yando sé illume tunta véra milya sómarya,
and just as he makes sacrifices on behalf of the people, so it is necessary for him to make sacrifices on behalf of himself – concerning sin.	ar síve caris yancar rá i lien, tambe mauya sen care yancar yando rá insen – pa úcare.
Furthermore, a person does not receive this glory by his own doing , but solely when he is called by God, as was also Aaron.	Ente, quén ua came alcar sina insenen, mal eryave íre náse yálina lo Eru, ve náne yando Áron.
"Thus also the Christ did not glorify himself, as if he made himself a chief priest. who did so was who said about him: ""You are my son; I today begat you."""	"Sie yando i Hristo ua alcaryane inse, ve qui carnesexe héra airimo. Ye se-carne sie náne ye quente pa se: ""Tyé ná yondonya; inye síra óne tye."""
"In the same manner he says also in another place: ""You are a priest forever, in the manner of Melchizedek."""	"Mi imya lé quetis yando hyana nómesse: ""Elye ná airimo tennoio, mi lérya Melciserec."""
In the days of his flesh Jesus sent prayers and petitions to who could save him from death, with strong cries and tears, and he was heard for his awe for God.	Hráveryo auressen Yésus mentane hyamiéli ar arcandeli yenna polle se-rehta et qualmello, polde rambelínen ar nírelínen, ar anes hlárina áyaryanen Eruva.
Though he was Son, he learnt to be obedient by the things that he suffered.	Ómu anes Yondo, parnes náve canwacimya i natainen yar perpéres.
Furthermore, after he was made perfect, he was who distributes eternal salvation to all that heed his commands.	Ente, apa anes carna ilvana, anes ye sate oira rehtie illin i cimir canwaryar.
For he was summoned by God, to be a chief priest, in the manner of Melchizedek.	An anes tultaina lo Eru, náven héra airimo, mi lérya Melciserec.
Concerning him we have many things to say – and making you understand them is difficult, since your hearing has been made slow.	Pa sé samilme rimbe nati quetien – ar tyarie le hanya tai ná urda, pan hlarielda anaie carna lenca.
And though now you did well if you were teachers, for you it is necessary that someone teaches you again the first things of God's word. You have need of milk, not of firm food,	An ómu sí carnelde arya qui anelde peantalli, elden mauya i quén peanta len ata i minye nati Eruo quetto. Samilde maure ilinwa, lá ronda matsova,
and everyone who drinks of milk is not skilled about the word of righteousness, for he is a child.	an ilquen ye suce ilimo ua maite pa i quetta failiéva, an náse hína.
But firm food is for who are fully grown, for who by use taught their perceptions how to separate good from evil.	Mal ronda matso ná in nar aqua álienwe, in yuhtiénen peánier tuntieltar manen ciltie márie ulcullo.
Therefore, after passing from the first things in the teaching of Christ, let us seek the full understanding, not again establishing a foundation about repentance from dead works and faith in God,	Etta, apa autie i minye natillon i peantiéno Hristo, alve cesta i quanta hande, lá ata tulcala talma pa inwis qualini cardallon ar savie Erusse,
the teaching about baptisms and the putting of hands, the resurrection of dead ones and everlasting judgement.	i peantie pa tumyaler ar i panie maiva, i enortie qualiniva ar oialea namie.
And that we shall do, if God allows.	Ar ta caruvalve, qui Eru lave.
For if people at one time have received the light and have tasted the gift from heaven and have had a measure of Holy Spirit,	An qui queni mi lú er acámier i cala ar atyávier i anna menello ar asámier lesta Aire Feo,
and have tasted God's good word and the powers of the coming Arda ,	ar atyávier Eruo mára quetta ar i túlala Ardo túri,
but have fallen away, then one cannot renew their repentance, for they crucify again the Son of God for themselves and shame him.	mal alantier oa, tá mo ua pole envinyata inwisselta, an tarwestalte ata i Eruion inten ar naityar se.
For the ground that drinks the rain that frequently falls upon it, and bears plants that are good for the cultivators, receives a blessing from God.	An i talan ya suce i miste ya rimbave lanta sanna, ar cole olvar yar nar máre alamoryain, came aistie Erullo.
But if it bears thorns and thistles, it is counted as nothing and near to being cursed, and in the end it is burnt.	Mal qui colis neceli ar nelmasirpi, nas nótina ve munta ar hare návenna hunta, ar i mettasse nas urtaina.
Though we spoke to you thus, beloved ones, concerning you we are sure of the better things that lead to salvation.	Ómu quetilme lenna sie, meldar, pa lé nalme tance i arye nation yar tulyar rehtienna.
For God is not unjust, failing to recall your labour and the love of his name that you showed as servants for the holy ones, as still you are.	An Eru ua úfaila, loitala enyale mótielda ar i melme esseryava ya tannelde ve núror i airin, ve en nalde.
For we wish that everyone among you will show a burning spirit to have the full surety until the end.	Ar merilme i ilquen mici le tanuva uryala şúle samien i quanta tancie tenna i tyel.
Thus you will not be slow, but will do like they do who by faith and patience are hears to the promises.	Sie ualde nauva lence, mal caruvar ve té carir i saviénen ar cólenen nar aryoni i vandaron.
For when God made his promise to Abraham, he gave his promise by himself, since there did not exist anyone greater by whom it it was possible for him to give it.	An íre Eru carne vandarya Avrahámen, antanes vandarya insenen, pan ua enge aiquen ambe túra yenen ence sen anta sa.
And thus, after Abraham showed patience, he received this promise.	Ar sie, apa Avraham tanne cóle, camnes vanda sina.
For men give their oaths by who is greater, and their oath is the end of every dispute, since they are obliged by it.	An atani antar vandaltar yenen ná ambe túra, ar vandalta ná i metta ilya costo, pan nalte naute sanen.
In this manner God, when he wanted to show to the heirs of the promise how unchangeable his decision was, made himself obliged to them.	Lé sinasse Eru, íre mernes tana i vando aryonin manen alavistima şantierya náne, carnexe nauta tien.
Thus, by two things that cannot change and concerning which God cannot lie, you that have escaped to the refuge can have great urgency to keep the hope put before us.	Sie, nat attanen yat uat pole ahya ar pa yat Eru ua pole hure, elve i uşúşier i caumanna polir same túra horme hepien i estel panyaina epe ve.
This hope we have as an anchor for the soul, stable and firm, and it reaches beyond the veil,	Estel sina samilve ve ciryampa i fean, tulca ar tanca, ar rahtas han i fanwa,
to the place into which Jesus went and opened the way for us, he who has been made a chief priest forever, by the manner of Melchizedek.	i nómenna yanna Yésus lende ar pantane i malle ven, sé ye anaie carna héra airimo tennoio, Melcisiréco lénen.
This Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Highest God, met Abraham when he returned from the victory over the kings and blessed him.	Melciserec sina, aran Sálemo, airimo i Antura Eruo, velle Avraham íre nanwennes apa i apaire or i arani ar aistane se.
To him Abraham gave a tenth of all things. First he is, as his name indicates, king of righteousness, and then also king of Salem, that is, king of peace.	Sen Avraham antane quaista ilye nation. Minyave náse, ve esserya tea, aran failiéva, ar tá yando aran Sálemo, ta ná, aran raineo.
He is without father or mother and lacks a genealogy , and he does not have beginning of days or end of life. Thus he is a picture of the Son of God, remaining as priest forever.	Náse ú ataro hya amillo ar pene ontaleparma, ar uas same yesta aurion hya metta coiviéno. Sie náse emma i Eruiono, lemyala ve airimo tennoio.
Heed well how great he is, this man to whom Abraham, the patriarch , gave a tenth of the best goods seized in the war.	Cima mai manen túra náse, nér sina yen Avraham, i nossentur, antane quaista i arye armaron mapaine i ohtasse.
True, the men in the descent from Levi that receive the priesthood have a command in the Law about taking tithes from the people, that is, rom their own brothers, though they as well are Abraham's kin.	Nanwa, i neri i ontalesse Lévillo i camir i airimosse samir axan i Şanyesse pa mapie quaistar i liello, ta ná, vére hánoltallon, ómu yando té nar Avrahámo nosseo.
But this man, whose descent does not come from them, took tithes from Abraham and blessed who had the promises.	Mal nér sina, yeo ontale ua tule ho té, namper quaistali Avrahamello ar aistane ye sáme i vandar.
Beyond every dispute, the smaller is blessed by the greater.	Ilya cos pella, i ambe pitya ná aistana lo i ambe túra.
And in the first affair, men that are dying receive tithes, but in the second affair: a person who has the witness that he is living.	Ar i minya nattosse, nereli i quélar camir quaistar, mal i attea nattosse: quén ye same i vettie i náse coirea.
And, if I may so speak, through Abraham also Levi who receives tithes has paid tithes,	Ar, qui lertan sie carpa, ter Avraham yando Lévi ye came quaistar apátie quaistali,
for he still existed in his father's loin when Melchizedek met him.	an enges en ataryo oşwesse íre Melciserec velle se.
If one indeed receives a perfect state through the priesthood of Levites – for that was a part when the Law was given to the people – how was there still a need that would arise another priest, after the manner of Melchizedek and not said to be after Aaron's manner?	Qui mo é camne ilvana sóma ter i airimosse Léviron – an ta náne ranta íre i Şanye náne antaina i lien – manen enge en maure i ortumne hyana airimo, Melciseréco lénen ar lá quétina náve Árono lénen?
For the man of whom these things are said was born in another tribe, from which nobody has served at the altar.	An i nér pa ye nati sine nar quétine náne nóna mir hyana nosse, yallo úquen evévier ara i yangwa.
For as everybody knows, our Lord came from the tribe of Juda , and Moses said nothing about priests from that tribe.	An ve ilquen ista, Herulva túle ho nosserya Yehúra, ar Móses quente munta pa airimor ho nosse tana.
And is still more easily visible that arises another priest, similiar to Melchizedek,	Ar ná en ambe aşcénima i orta hyana airimo, vávea Melciserecenna,
who is made so, not by the law of a commandment that lies upon flesh, but by the power of an indesctructible life.	ye ná carna sie, lá i şanyenen axano ya caita hrávenna, mal i túrenen alanancárima coiviéno.
"For in witness is said: ""You are a priest forever, in the manner of Melchizedek."""	"An vettiesse ná quétina: ""Nalye airimo tennoio, mi lérya Melciserec."""
Thus the earlier commandment is put away, for it is weak and is not beneficial.	Sie i ambe arinya axan ná panyaina oa, an nas milya ar ua aşea.
For the Law made nothing perfect, but the bringing of a better hope did so: the hope by which we come near to God.	An i Şanye carne munta ilvana, mal i talie arya estelwa carne sie: i estel yanen túlalve hare Erunna.
That did not happen without an oath.	Ta ua martane ú vando.
"For indeed there are others that have been made priests without a promise, but there is one having a promise given by the One who said about him: ""The Lord has given his promise, and he will not change his choice: You are a priest forever."""	"An é ear exeli i anaier cárine airimor ú vando, mal ea quén arwa vando antaina lo i Er ye quente pa sé: ""I Héru ánie vandarya, ar uas vistuva cilmerya: Nalye airimo tennoio."""
Thus for a covenant that better Jesus has been given as security.	Etta véren ta arya Yésus anaie antaina ve varnasse.
Furthermore, it was necessary for numerous ones to be priests, since death stopped them from remaining,	Ente, mauyane rimbalin náve airimóli, pan qualme pustane te lemiello,
but he, since he has a remaining and eternal life, has his priesthood without successors.	mal sé, pan samis vórea ar oira coivie, same airimosserya ú neuroron.
Therefore it is possible for him also to completely save who come to God through him, since he is always alive, to petition for them.	Etta ece sen yando aqua rehta i tulir Erunna ter sé, pan náse illume coirea, arcien tien.
For such a chief priest was beneficial for us: holy, without evil, undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than heaven.	An síte héra airimo náne ven aşea: aire, ulculóra, alavahtaina, ciltaina úcarindollon, ar carna tára lá menel.
It is not necessary for him every day, as those chief priests did, to sacrifice sacrifices: first concerning his own sins and then concerning the since of the people (for that he did a single time when he sacrificed himself),	Ua mauya sen ilya auresse, ve yane hére airimor carner, yace yancali: minyave pa vére úcareryar ar tá pa i úcari i lieo (an ta carnes erya lú íre yances inse),
and the Law appoints men as chief priests though they are weak, but the word of the promise that came after the Law appoints a Son, who is made perfect forever.	an i Şanye sate nereli ve hére airimor ómu nalte milye, mal i quetta i vando ya túle apa i Şanye sate Yondo, ye ná carna ilvana tennoio.
The sum of the things said is this: We have such a chief prist, and he has sat down at the right side of the throne of the heavenly Majesty,	I onotie i quétine nation ná si: Samilve síte héra airimo, ar ahámies undu i foryasse i mahalmo i meneldea Meletyava,
as a servant of the holy place and the true tent, which the Lord has erected, and not a man.	ve núro i aire nómeo ar i nanwa lancoasse, ya i Héru ortane, ar lá atan.
For every chief priest is appointed to sacrifice gifts and sacrifices alike, and it was necessary also for this person to have a thing to sacrifice.	An ilya héra airimo ná sátina yacien annali ar yancali véla, ar mauyane yando quén sinan same nat yacien.
If he existed now on earth, he was not a priest, for there are those that sacrifice gifts by the Law.	Qui enges sí cemende, únes airimo, an ear i yacir annar i Şanyenen.
"But they serve as a type and a shadow of the heavenly things, just as Moses, when he was to make the tent, received the divine command. And he says: ""Take heed that you do all things according to the image shown to you on the mountain."""	"Mal té veuyar ve epemma ar leo i meneldie nation, aqua ve Móses, íre carumnes i lancoa, camne i valaina canwa. An quetis: ""Cima i caril ilye nati ve i emma tanaina lyen i orontesse."""
But now Jesus has received a more splendid position as servant , for thus he is an intermediary of a covenant which in a similar manner is better, founded upon better promises.	Mal sí Yésus acámie ambe maira núronóme, ar sie náse enelmo véreo ya mi vávea lé ná arya, tulcaina arye vandalinnar.
For if the first coventant was perfect, nobody were going to seek a place for a second one,	An qui i minya vére náne ilvana, úquen cestumne nóme attean,
"for he indeed perceives guilt when he says: ""Behold! The days will come, says the Lord, when I shall make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Juda ,"	"an é tuntas cáma íre quetis: ""Yé! I auri tuluvar, quete i Héru, íre caruvan vinya vére as i már Israélo ar i már Yehúro,"
not like the covenant that I made with their fathers on the day that I took their hand and led them out of Egypt. For they did not remain in my covenant, and they are not important to me more, says the Lord.	lá ve i vére ya carnen as atariltar i auresse ya nampen málta ar te-tulyane et Mirrandorello. An té uar lemyane vérenyasse, ar ualte valdie nin ambe, quete i Héru.
For this is the covenant that I shall make with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I shall put my laws in their minds, and in their hearts I shall write them. And I shall be their God, and they shall be my people.	An si ná i vére ya caruvan as Israélo már apa auri ente, quete i Héru: Panyuvan şanyenyar sámaltassen, ar endaltasse tecuyanyet. Ar nauvan Ainolta, ar té nauvar lienya.
"And they shall by no means instruct, everyone his neighbor and everyone his brother, saying: ""Know the Lord!"" For all among them shall know me, from the smalles to the greatest among them."	"Ar laume peantulvalte, ilquen armarorya ar ilquen hánorya, quétala: ""Á ista i Héru!"" An illi mici te istuvar ni, i ampityallo i anturanna mici te."
"For I shall be mercifull about their unjust doings, and I shall by no means recall their sins more."""	"An nauvan órávala pa úfaile cardaltar, ar laume enyaluvan úcareltar ambe."""
"When he says ""a new covenant"", he has abandoned the former covenant. But that which is abandoned and worn-out will soon pass."	"Íre quetis ""vinya vére"", ehehties i noa vére. Mal ta ya ná hehtaina ar yeryaina rato autuva."
Also the former covenant indeed had laws about service and a santurary which was of this world.	Yando i noa vére é sáme şanyeli pa vevie ar yána ya náne mar sino.
For one made a first tent-room in which were the lampstand and the showing of the breads, and it is called the Holy.	An mo carne minya lancoa-şambe yasse enger i calmatarma ar i tanie i massaiva, ar nas estaina i Aire.
But behind the second veil there was a tent-room called the Holy of Holies.	Mal ca i attea fanwa enge lancoa-şambe estaina i Aire Airion.
There were the altar of incence and the Ark of the Covenant, wholly covered by gold, in which was the receptable of gold having the manna and Aaron's staff which sprouted and the tablets of the covenant;	Tasse enger i yangwa nisqueo ar i Vérecolca, aqua tópina maltanen, yasse enge i camma maltava arwa i máno ar Árono vandil ya tuiane ar i palmat i véreo;
but above it were the glorious pair of cherubs, which screened the cover. But now is not the time to speak about every single among these things.	mal or sa enget i alcarinque ceruvu, yat teltanet i túpo. Mal sí ua i lúme quetien pa ilya erya mici nati sine.
After these things were made so, the priests went into the first tent-room at all times to do acts of service ,	Apa nati sine náner cárine sie, i airimor lender mir i minya lancoa-şambe ilye lúmessen carien núromolier,
but into the second room the chief priest alone goes, a single time in one year, not without blood, which he sacrifices for himself and for the people's sins that are done without knowledge.	mal mir i attea şambe i héra airimo erinqua lelya, erya lúmesse mi loa er, lá ú serceo, ya yacis insen ar i lieo úcarin yar nar cárine ú istyo.
Thus the Holy Spirit lets us understand that the path into the holy place was not made known when the first tent stood.	Sie i Aire Fea lave ven hanya i ua náne i tie mir i aire nóme carna sinwa íre i minya lancoa tarne.
This tent was an image of the time that now has come, and as the image was, gifts and sacrifices are now sacrificed. But they cannot make the man who does service, perfect concerning his conscience,	Lancoa sina náne emma pa i lúme ya sí utúlie, ar ve i emma náne, annali ar yancali nar sí yácine. Mal tai uar pole care i nér ye care núromolie, ilvana pa immotuntierya,
but touch on nothing except some foods and drinks and various baptisms. They were commands of the flesh, until the time for making things straight came.	mal appar munta hequa matsoli ar yuldali ar alavéle tumyaléli. Anelte axalli i hráveo, tenna i lúme carien nati tére túle.
But when Christ came as chief priest of the boons that have come, through the greater and more perfect tent not made by hands, that is, not of this creation,	Mal íre Hristo túle ve héra airimo i mánaron yar utúlier, ter i ambe hoa ar ambe ilvana lancoa lá carna mainen, ta ná, lá ontie sino,
he went one time and forever into the holy place, not having blood of goats or young bulls, but having his own blood, getting an eternal deliverance for us.	lendes erya lú ar tennoio mir i aire nóme, lá arwa serceo nyéniron ar nesse mundoron, mal arwa véra serceryo, ñetala oira etelehtie ven.
For if the blood of goats and bulls and ash of a cow, splashed on those that have been defiled, can hallow as far as making the flesh clean,	An qui i serce nyéniron ar mundoron ar litte yaxio, palastaina innar anaier vahtaine, pole airita tenna carie i hráve poica,
how much more will blood of the Christ, who by an eternal spirit sacrificed himself without stain to God, purify our consciences from dead works, for us to labor for the living Deity?	manen olya ambe serce i Hristo, ye oira fairenen yancexe ú vaxeo Erun, poituva immotuntielvar qualini cardallon, molielvan i coirea Ainon?
And so he is an intermediary of a new covenant. Therefore that are called can receive the promise of eternal inheritance, since a death has occurred to release them by ransom from their crimes under the former covenant.	Ar sie náse enelmo vinya véreo. Etta i nar yáline polir came i vanda oira aryoniéno, pan qualme amartie lehtien te nanwerenen ongweltallon nu i noa vére.
For where exists a last will, it is necessary to be established that who wrote it, is dead.	An yasse ea métima nirme, mauya náve tulcaina i ye tence sa, ná qualin.
Not before he is dead is it in force, since it does not have force at time that the person who made it, is alive.	Lá nó náse qualin nas túresse, pan uas same túre mí lúme ya i quén ye carne sa, ná coirea.
And when every commandment written in the Law was spoken by Moses to the people, he took the blood of the young oxes and the goats with water and red wool and hyssop and sprinkled the book itself and the entire people,	An íre ilya axan técina i Şanyesse náne quétina lo Móses i lienna, nampes i serce i nesse mundoron ar i nyéniron as nén ar carne tó ar airaşea ar palastane i parma imma ar i quanda lie,
"saying: ""This is the blood of the covenant which God has put on you."""	"quétala: ""Si ná i serce i véreo ya Eru apánie lesse."""
And he sprinkled the tent and all the vessels of the service in the same manner, with the blood.	Ar palastanes i lancoa ar ilye i veni i veviéno mí imya lé, i sercenen.
By the law nearly all things are cleansed with blood, and if blood is not poured , is not forgiveness.	I Şanyenen harive ilye nati nar poitaine sercenen, ar qui serce ua ulyaina, ua ea apsenie.
Therefore, as had to be , the images of the heavenly things were by them purified, but the heavenly things themselves have been purified by sacrifices which were better than such sacrifices.	Etta, maurenen, i emmar i meneldie nation náner tainen poitaine, mal i meneldie nati inte anaier poitaine yancalínen yar nar arye lá taiti yancar.
For Christ went into, not a sanctuary made by hands, but heaven itself, to come before God's face on our behalf.	An Hristo lende mir, lá ainas cárina mainen, mal menel imma, tulien epe Eruo cendele rá ven.
Furthermore, he did not come to sacrifice himself frequently, like the chief priest goes into the sanctuary from year to year, bringing blood which is not is own.	Ente, uas túle yacien inse rimbave, ve i héra airimo mene mir i ainas loallo loanna, túlula serce ya ua vérarya.
Then it was necessary for him to suffer frequently from the founding of the world. But now he has made himself known at a single time and forever at the conclusion of the age, to put away sin by sacrificing himself.	Tá mauyane sen perpere rimbave tulciello i mardeva. Mal sí acáries inse sinwa mi erya lú ar tennoio i rando tyeldesse, panien oa úcare yaciénen inse.
And as is reserved for Men to die a single time, but thereafter a judgement,	Ar ve ná sátina Atanin quale erya lú, mal epta námie,
so also the Christ was sacrifice a single time and forever to carry the sins of many. He will not come concerning sin at the second occasion that he will show himself, to that look to him in order to receive salvation.	sie yando i Hristo náne yácina erya lú ar tennoio colien rimbalion úcari. Uas tuluva pa úcare mí attea lú ya tanuvas inse, in yétar senna camien rehtie.
And since the Law has a shadow of the coming good things, but not the full picture of the things, the sacrifices sacrificed from year to year cannot make perfect who bring them.	An pan i Şanye same leo i túlala mánaron, mal lá i quanta emma i nation, i yancar yácine loallo loanna uar pole care ilvane i talar tai.
If they did, did one not stop sacrificing, the worshippers being cleansed a single time and forever, no more perceiving sin in themselves?	Qui carnelte, ma mo ua pustane yace, i tyerindor nála poitaina erya lú ar tennoio, lá ambe tuntala úcare intesse?
On the contrary, by these sacrifices there is a recalling of sins from year to year,	Úsie, sine yancainen ea enyalie úcariva loallo loanna,
and the blood of oxen and goats cannot take sin away.	an i serce mundoron ar nyéniron ua pole mapa úcare oa.
"Therefore, when he comes into the world he says: ""Sacrifice and offering you did not want, but you prepared a body for me."	"Etta, íre tulis mir i mar quetis: ""Yanca ar yacie ualye merne, mal manwanel hroa nin."
"You do not have joy in burnt sacrifices, or in sacrifices concerning sins."""	"Ual same alasse urtaine yancassen, hya yancassen pa úcari."""
"Then I said: ""Behold, I have come – in the scroll it is written about me – to do your will, God!"""	"Tá quenten: ""Yé, utúlien – i toluparmasse ná técina pa ni – carien indómelya, Eru!"""
"After he firstly said: ""You do not wish or have joy in sacrifices and offerings and burnt sacrifices and sin-sacrifice"" – which are sacrificed by the Law –"	"Apa minyave quentes: ""Ual merne hya sáme alasse mi yancar ar yacier ar urtaine yancar ar úcare-yancar"" – yar nar yácine i Şanyenen –"
"then he says: ""Behold, I have come to do your will."" He takes away the first to establish the second."	"tá quetis: ""Yé, utúlien carien indómelya."" Mapas oa i minya tulcien i attea."
"By that ""will"" we are hallowed by the sacrificing of the body of Jesus Christ, a single time and forever."	"Tana ""indómenen"" nalve airinte i yaciénen i hroava Yésus Hristo, erya lú ar tennoio."
Furthermore, every chief priest stands from day to day to serve and to sacrifice the same sacrifices frequently, since they cannot wholly take away sins.	Ente, ilya héra airimo tare aurello aurenna vevien ar yacien i imye yancar rimbave, pan tai uar oi pole aqua mapa oa úcari.
But this man sacrificed one sacrifice concerning sins forever and sat down at God's right hand,	Mal nér sina yance er yanca pa úcari oiale ar hamne undu ara Eruo forma,
from then waiting until his enemies shall be placed as a support for his feet.	ho tá lartala tenna ñottoryar nauvar panyaine ve tulco talyant.
For by a single sacrifice he has made that are hallowed perfect forever.	An erya yaciénen acáries i nar airinte ilvane tennoio.
"Furthermore, the Holy Spirit also witnesses to us, for after saying: ""This is the covenant that I will make with them in those days, the Lord is saying: I will put my laws in their heart, and in their mind I will write them"","	"Ente, i Aire Fea yando vetta ven, an apa quetie: ""Si ná i vére ya caruvan aselte ente auressen, quéta i Héru: Panyuvan şanyenyar endaltasse, ar sámaltasse tecuvanyet"","
"he also says: ""And their sins and their lawless acts I will by no means recall more."""	"yando quetis: ""Ar úcareltar ar şanyelóre cardaltar laume enyaluvan ambe."""
Where is forgiveness of them , is no more sacrificing concerning sin.	Yasse ea apsenie taiva, ua ea en yacie pa úcare.
Therefore, brothers, since we have courage about the path into the sanctuary by the blood of Jesus Christ,	Etta, hánor, pan samilve huore pa i tie mir i ainas Yésus Hristo sercenen,
a path that he opened up to us as a new and living path through the veil, that is, the flesh,	tie ya pantanes ven ve vinya ar coirea tie ter i fanwa, ta ná, i hráve,
and since we have a great chief priest over the house of God,	ar pan samilve túra airimo or i coa Eruva,
let us come having a faithful heard and a wholly firm faith, since our heart is cleanced from a wicked conscience and our bodies cleansed with pure water.	alve tule arwe voronda endo ar aqua tanca saviéno, pan endalva ná poitaina olca immotuntiello ar hroalvar sóvine poica nennen.
Let us still confess our hope, not being unsteady, for who gave the promise is steadfast.	Alve en etequenta estelelva, lá nála iltance, an ye antane i vanda ná voronda.
And let us give heed to one another, urging love and good deeds,	Ar alve cime quén i exe, hortien melme ar máre cardar,
not forsaking our meetings, as is the habit of some people, but encouraging one another, and that more so when you see the day approaching .	lá hehtala yomenielvar, ve quenelion haime, mal hortala quén i exe, ar i ambe sie íre cenilde i aure túla hare.
For if by will we sin after receiving the knowledge of the truth, no longer remains a sacrifice concerning sins.	An qui nirmenen úcarilve apa camie i istya i nanwiéva, ua ambe lemya yanca pa úcari.
Instead one in fear looks ahead to judgement and to a fiery burning spirit which will devour that stand against it.	Mí men mo cauresse yéta ompa namienna ar uruiva urtala şúlenna ya ammatuva i tarir sanna.
Anyone who has broken the Law of Moses dies without mercy, when are two or three that are witnesses.	Aiquen ye arácie Móseo Şanye quale ú oraviéno, íre ear atta hya nelde i náner astarmor.
Of how much more harsh punishment, do you think, he is worthy who has trampled on the Son of God and who has failed to count as holy the blood of the covenant with which he was hallowed, and who has made the Spirit of Grace angry by contempt?	Manen ita ambe naraca paimeo, sanalye, sé nauva valda ye avattie i Eruionna ar ye oloitie note ve aire i serce i véreo yanen anes airinta, ar ye acárie i Erulisseo Faire rúşea nattiriénen?
"For we know who said: ""Mine is revenge; I will avenge"", and again: ""The Lord will judge his people."""	"An istalve ye quente: ""Ninya ná ahtarie; inye accaruva"", ar ata: ""I Héru namuva lierya."""
It is terrible to fall into the hands of the living God!	Ná rúcima lantie mir i coirea Eruo mát!
But recall the former days, in which, after you received the light, you suffered a great fight, having difficulties.	Mal enyala i noe auri, yassen, apa camnelde i cala, perpérelde túra mahtie, arwe urdiéli.
There were occasions when you were openly given to mockeries and tribulations alike, and on some occasions you had a part with others that went through such things.	Enger lúli yassen anelde pantave antaine yaiwelin ar şangiélin véla, ar lúlissen sámelde ranta as exeli i lender ter síti nati.
For you showed compassion to that were in prison, and with joy you bore the stealing of your gods, knowing that you possessed which is better and remaining.	An tannelde ofelme in enger mandosse, ar mi alasse collelde i pilie armaldaiva, istala i haryanelde ya ná arya ar lemyala.
Therefore, do not throw away from yourselves your courage, which carries with it a great reward.	Etta, áva hate oa indello huorelda, ya cole as insa túra paityale.
For you have need of endurance, for you to receive that of which God gave his promise, after doing his will.	An samilde maure voronwiéva, camieldan ta pa ya Eru ánie vandarya, apa carie indómerya.
"For ""after an extremely short time who is coming shall come, and he will not be late""."	"An ""apa ita şinta lúme ye túla tuluva, ar uas nauva telwa."""
"But ""my righteous one shall have life by his faith"", but if ""he pulls himself away, my soul does not have joy by him""."	"Mal ""failanya samuva coivie saviénen"", ono qui ""tucis inse oa, feanya ua same alasse sénen""."
We are not of the kind that pulls itself away into undoing, but the kind that has faith, thus receiving life.	Elve uar i nostale ya tucixe oa mir nancarie, mal i nostale ya same savie, sie cámala coivie.
Faith is the safety of things about which one has hope, the showing of real which one still does not see.	Savie ná i varnasse nation pa yar mo same estel, i tanie nanwaron yar mo en ua cene.
For by such faith the old ones received witness.	An síte saviénen i yárar camner vettie.
By faith we perceive that the universe was arranged by God's word, and so which is seen has come from whos is not revealed.	Saviénen tuntalve i náne Ea partaina Eruo quettanen, ar sie ya ná cénima utúlie yallo ua apantaina.
By faith Abel sacrificed to God a sacrifice more splendid than that of Cain, and by that faith he received witness that he was righteous, God witnessing about his gifts – and through that he still speaks, although he died.	Saviénen Ável yance Erun yanca ambe mirwa epe ta Caino, ar tana saviénen camnes vettie i anes faila, Eru vettala pa annaryar, ar ter ta en carpas, ómu qualles.
By faith Enoch was taken away, to stop him from seeing death, and he was not found, since God took him away. Before he was taken away he received the witness that he was good in God's eyes.	Saviénen Énoc náne mapaina oa, se-pustien ceniello qualme, ar únes hírina, pan Eru nampe se oa. Nó anes mapaina camnes i vettie i anes mára Eruo hendusse.
Furthermore, without faith it is not possible to be good from his perspective, for it is necessary for that comes near to God to believe that he exists, and that he rewards anyone who seeks him.	Ente, ú saviéno ua cárima náve mára sen, an mauya yen tule hare Erunna save i eas, ar i paityas aiquen ye cesta se.
By faith Noah, after he had a warning about things that still were not seen, showed himself God-loving and built an ark for the saving of his family, and by his faith he judged the world, and he was made heir of the salvation that comes from faith.	Saviénen Nóa, apa sámes orie pa natali yar en uar náne cénine, tannexe Erunilda ar carastane marcirya i rehtien nosseryava, ar savieryanen namnes i mar, ar anes carna aryon i rehtiéno ya tule saviello.
By faith Abraham, when he was called, did according to the command and went forth into a place which he was destined to receive as an heir's part, and he went forth not knowing where to he was going to travel.	Saviénen Avraham, íre anes yálina, carne ve i canwa ar etelende mir nóme ya anes martyaina came ve aryono ranta, ar etelendes lá istala yanna lelyumnes.
By faith he dwelt as a foreign person in the land of promise as in a foreign land, and he dwelt in tents with Isaac and Jacob, that were heirs with him of the same promise.	Saviénen marnes ve ettelea quén i nóresse vandava ve ettelea nóresse, ar marnes lancoalissen as Ísac ar Yácov, i aner aryolli óse i imya vando.
For he looked forward to the city having true foundations, the builder and craftsman of which is God.	An yentes ompa i ostonna arwa nanwe talmalion, yó şamno ar tano ná Eru.
By faith also Sarah received power to conceive seed, although she was too old, since she counted him faithful who gave the promise.	Saviénen yando Sara camne túre nostien erde, ómu anes acca yára, pan nontes sé voronda ye antane i vanda.
Thus from one man, who also was like dead, were born children numerous like the stars of heaven and like the sands on the shore of the sea, uncountable.	Sie erya nerello, ye yando náne ve qualin, náner nóne hínali rimbe ve menelo tinwi ar ve i litsi earo fárasse, únótime.
In faith all these people died, though they did not see the promises made true, but saw them from afar and greated them, and they confessed that they were strangers and exiles on earth.	Saviesse ilye queni sine qualler, ómu ualde cenne i vandar cárine nanwe, mal cenneltet hairello ar suilaner tai, ar etequentaner i anelte etteleáli ar etyali cemende.
For who say such things show that they seek a place that will be their own.	An i quetir síti natali tanar i cestalte nóme ya nauva véralta.
And yet, if indeed they kept in mind the place from which they went forth, it was possible for them to return.	Ananta, qui é hempelte sámasse i nóme yallo etelendelte, ence tien nanwene.
But now they sought a better place, that is, a heavenly place. Therefore God is not ashamed about them when he is called their God, for he has prepared a city for them.	Mal sí cestanelte arya nóme, ta ná, meneldea nóme. Etta Eru ua naityana pa te íre náse estaina Ainolta, an amanwies osto tien.
By faith Abraham, when he was tested, sacrificed Isaac, and the man who had received the promises was sacrificing his only-born son,	Saviénen Avraham, íre anes tyastaina, yance Ísac, ar i nér ye acámie i vandar náne yácala ernóna yondorya,
"though was said to him: "" which will be called 'your seed' will come through Isaac."""	"ómu náne quétina senna: ""Ya naiva estaina 'erdelya' tuluva ter Ísac."""
But he supposed that God could raise him also from the dead, and figuratively he indeed received him from there.	Mal intyanes i polle Eru orta se yando qualinillon, ar emmanen é camneses talo.
Furthermore, by faith Isaak blessed Jacob and Esau concerning the things that were to come.	Ente, saviénen Ísac aistane Yácov ar Ésau pa i nati yar tulumner.
By faith Jacob, near to his death, blessed both of Joseph's sons and worshiped leaning on the top of his staff.	Saviénen Yácov, íre anes hare qualmenna, aistane yúyo yondoron Yósefo ar tyerne nírala vandilyo inganna.
By faith Joseph, near to his end, spoke about how the sons of Israel would go out, and he gave a command about his bones.	Saviénen Yósef, hare mettaryanna, carampe pa manen Israelindi lelyumner ettenna, ar antanes canwa pa axoryar.
By faith Moses was hidden for three months by his parents after he was born, since they saw the beauty of the baby and did not fear the command of the king.	Saviénen Móses náne nurtaina ter astor nelde lo ontaryat apa náve nóna, pan cennelte i lapseo vanie ar uar runcer i arano canwallo.
By faith Moses, after he came to manhood, refused to be called Pharao's daughter's son,	Saviénen Móses, apa túles vienna, váquente náve estaina Fárao selyeo yondo,
choosing to suffer evil with God's people above having joy in sin for a time,	cílala perpere ulco as Eruo lie or samie alasse mi úcare ter lúme,
for he counted the shame of Christ more precious than the treasures of Egypt, for he looked forward to the giving of the reward.	an nontes i naityale Hristova mirwa epe Mirrandoro harmar, an yentes ompa i antienna i paityaléva.
By faith he left Egypt, but without fearing the king, and he was faithful as if he saw the Invisible One.	Saviénen oantes Mirrandorello, mal ú ruciéno i aranello, and an anes voronda ve qui cennes i Alacénima.
By faith he made the Passover and the splashing of the blood, to stop the Destroyer from touching their firstborn.	Saviénen carnes i Lahtie ar i palastie i serceva, pustien i Nancarindo appiello minnónaltar.
By faith the walls of Jericho fell after they were encircled for seven days.	Saviénen Yerico rambar lantaner apa anelte péline ter auri otso.
By faith Rahab the harlot did not die with that were not obedient, since she received hte spies in peace.	Saviénen Ráhav i imbacinde ua qualle as i uar canwacimye, pan camnes i larmor rainesse.
And what more am I to say? For time will fail me if I tell about Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephta, David and also Samuel and the Prophets,	Ar mana amba quetuvan? An lúme ni-loituva qui nyarin pa Ireon, Varac, Samson, Yefta, Lavir ar yando Samuel ar i Erutercánor,
who by faith conquered kingdoms, did justice, received promises, stopped the mouths of lions,	ye saviénen turuner araniéli, carner failie, camner vandali, pustaner raurolion antor,
blocked the power of fire, escaped from the blades of swords, from a weak state were made strong; they were bold in war, they scattered foreign armies.	tamper ruiveo túre, úşer macillion maicallon, milya sómallo náner cárine polde; anelte canye ohtasse, vintanelte ettelie hosseli.
Some women received back their dead by resurrection, but others were tormented since they did not want a release by ransom, for they wanted to receive a better resurrection.	Nisseli nancamner qualiniltar enortiénen, mal exeli náner ñwalyaine pan ualte merne lehtie nanwerenen, an mernelte came arya enortie.
Others received scorns and lashings, indeed more than those, bonds and prisons.	Exeli camner yaiweli ar ripiéli, é amba la tai, nútelínen ar mandolínen.
They were slain with stones, they were tested, they were sawn into peaces, they died being slain with swords, they covered themselves with skins of sheep and goats, while they were in need, in tribulation, suffering evil behavior.	Anelte nance sarnelínen, anelte tyastaine, anelte saraine mir rantali, quallelte nála nance macillínen, tompeltexer helmalínen mámaron ar nyéniron, íre anelte mauresse, şangiesse, perpérala ulca lengie.
They were too good for this world. They wandered in deserts and caves and holes in earth.	Anelte acca mani mar sinan. Vantanelte mi erumeli ar rottoli ar eccali cemeno.
And yet all these people, though they received a witness about their faith, did not receive the fulfillment of the promise.	Ananta ilye queni sine, ómu camnelte vettie pa savielta, uar ñente i vando amaquatie.
For God foresaw a better thing for us; thus they were not made perfect away from us.	An Eru apacenne arya nat elven; sie únelte cárine ilvane oa vello.
Therefore, having that great a cloud of witnesses around us, may we as well put away every heavy thing and the sin that quickly ensnares us, and let us run with endurance the race put before us,	Etta, arwe ta hoa fanyo vettolíva os ve, nai yando elve panyuva oa ilya lunga nat ar i úcare ya lintiénen vi-remba, ar alve nore voronwiénen i norme panyaina epe vi,
while we look to who is Chief of our faith and who makes it perfect, Jesus. For the joy that was put before him he suffered the cross, despising shame, and he has sat down to the right of the throne of God.	íre yétalve yenna ná savielvo Cáno ar ye care sa ilvana, Yésus. I alassen ya náne panyaina epe se perpéres i tarwe, nattírala naityale, ar ahámie undu i foryasse i mahalmo Eruva.
Heed well who has borne such hostile talk from who sin against themselves; then you will not be tired and give out in your soul.	Cima mai ye ocólie taite cotya carpie ho i úcarir intenna; tá ualde nauva lumbe ar taltuva fealdasse.
Fighting against sin, you still have not resisted as far as blood,	Mahtala úcarenna, ualde en atárie tenna serce,
"but you have allowed the exhortation that speaks to you as sons: ""My son, do not despise the chastisement of the Lord, and do not totter when you receive his firm words,"	"mal alávielde i hortie ya quete lenna ve yondor: ""Yonya, áva nattire paimesta i Héruo, ar áva talta íre camitye tulce quettaryar,"
"for to whom the Lord loves, he gives chastiment, and he flays everyone that he receives as son."""	"an yen i Héru mele, antas paimesta, an ripis ilquen ye camis ve yondo."""
By chastisement you are faithful. God behaves towards you as towards sons. For who is the son that the father does not give chastisement?	Paimestanen nalde voronde. Eru lenga len ve yondoin. An man ná i yondo yen i atar ua anta paimesta?
But if you are without the chastisement in which all have had part, you are really children conceived outside of marriage, and not sons.	Mal qui nalde ú i paimesto yasse illi asámier ranta, nalve anwave hinali nostaine ettesse vesto, ar la yondoli.
Furthermore, we had the fathers of our flesh to give us chastisement, and we had awe for them. Will we not much more do well if we subject ourselves to the Father of spirits, in order to have life?	Ente, sámelve hrávelvo atari antien ven paimesta, ar sámelve áya tien. Lau ita ambe carilve mai qui panyalvexe nu i Atar fairion, samien coivie?
For they for a short time gave us chastisement, as was good in their eyes, but he does that since is is beneficial to us, for us to receive a share in his holiness.	An té ter şinta lúme antaner ven paimesta, ve náne mára mi hendulta, mal sé care ta pan nas aşea ven, camielvan ranta aireryasse.
In the moment that it is given, every chastisement seems, not like joy, but like a grief; and yet afterwards to those that are instructed by it it gives fruit of piece, that is, righteousness.	Mí lú ya nas antaina, ilya paimesta şéya, lá ve alasse, mal ve nyére; ananta epeta in nar peantaine sanen antas yáve raineva, ta ná, failie.
Therefore strengthen the hands that hang down and the weak knees,	Etta á antorya i mát yat lingat undu ar i milye occat,
and make straight ways for your feet. Thus which is paralyzed will not be put out of joint, but rather it will be healed.	ar cara tére maller taluldant. Sie ya ná úlévima ua nauva panyaina et lequettello, mal ambe rato nauvas nestaina.
Pursue peace with all people, and the sanctification without which nobody will see the Lord,	Á roita raine as ilye queni, ar i airitie ú yó úquen cenuva i Heru,
while you take heed that nobody will be deprived of God's grace and do not allow poisonous root to grow up to cause difficulty and to soil many.	íre cimilde i úquen nauva nehtaina lisseo Eruo ar uar lave hloirea şundun tuia ama tyarien urdie ar vahtien rimbali.
Thus will not be anyone who fornicates or anyone unholy, like Esau, who in exchange for a single meal gave away his right as firstborn.	Sie ua euva aiquen ye úpuhta hya aiquen úaire, ve Ésau, ye quaptalesse erya matten antane oa minnónierya.
For you as well know that afterwards, when he wished to possess the blessing, he was turned away. For although in tears he sought a change of mind, he did not find place for it.	An yando lé istar i epeta, ire mernes harya i aistie, anes quérina oa. An ómu nírelissen cestanes inwis, uas hirne nóme san.
For now you have not come near to which one can touch and which is kindled by fire, to a cloud and gloom and a storm	An sí ualde utúlie hare yanna mo pole appa ar ya ná nartaina ruivenen, ana lumbo ar huive ar raumo
and a trumpet's sound and the voice that spoke; when they heard that voice, the people asked that nothing more be spoken to them.	ar hyólo lamma ar i óma ya carampe; íre hlasselte óma tana, i lie arcane i munta amba náve quétina tien.
"For they could not bear the commandment: ""And if an animal touches the mountain, it is necessary that it is slain with stones!"""	"An ualte polle cole i axan: ""Ar qui celva appa i oron, mauya i náse nanca sarnelínen!"""
"Furthermore, which they saw was so terrible that it caused Moses to say: ""I am afraid and shaking!"""	"Ente, ya cennelte náne ta rúcima i tyarnes Móses quete: ""Rúcan ar pélan!"""
But you have come near to Mount Sion and the city of the living God, a heavenly Jerusalem, and to tens of thousands of angels	Mal utúlielde hare Oron Síonna ar i coirea Eruo ostonna, meneldea Yerúsalem, ar valannar quaihúmi
gathered together, and to the congregation of the firstborn recorded in heaven, and to God who is judge of all, and to spirits of the righteous ones that are made perfect, and to Jesus, the intermediary of a new covenant, and the blood of sprinkling, which speaks in a manner better than the blood of Abel.	ócómienwe, ar i ocombenna i minnónaron minatécine menelde, ar Erunna ye na illion námo, ar fairennar i failaron i nar cárine ilvane, ar Yésunna, i enelmo vinya véreo, ar i serce palastiéva, ya carpa mi lé arya epe Ávelo serce.
See that you do not turn away who is speaking! For if they did not escape that turned him away when they received warning on earth, much more shall we not, if we turn away from who speaks from heaven.	Cena i ualde quere oa ye quéta! An qui té uar úşe i querner se oa íre camnelde orie cemende, ita ambe elve lauvar, qui querilvexer yello quete menello.
"At that time his voice shook the earth, but now he has given a promise, saying: ""For a second time I will shake, not earth alone, but also heaven."""	"Lúme yanasse ómarya palle i cemen, mal sí ánies vanda, quétala: ""Mi attea lú paluvan, lá cemen erinqua, mal yando menel."""
"The words ""for a second time"" indicate the taking away of the things that have been made, and so the things that are not shaken will remain."	"I quettar ""mi attea lú"" tear i mapie oa i nativa yar anaier cárine, ar sie i nati yar uar páline lemyuvar."
Therefore, since we will receive an unshakable kingdom, may we still have grace, by which we may serve God in reverence and awe.	Etta, pan camuvalve alapálima aranie, nai en samuvalve Erulisse, yanen lertalme veuya Erun mi ainocimie ar áya.
For our God is also a consuming fire.	An Ainolva na yando ammátala ruive.
May your brotherly love remain!	Nai hánonilmelda lemyuva!
Do not fail to show friendliness to strangers, for through it some, without knowing, have received angels as their guests.	Áva loita anta nilme etteleain, an ter sa queneli, ú istiéno, acámier valali ve aşaliltar.
Recall that are in prison, as if you are there with them, and those that suffer evil, since you as well are still in a body.	Enyala i ear mandosse, ve qui nalde tasse aselte, ar i perperir ulco, pan yando elde nar en hroasse.
May marriage be honorable among all, and the marriage-bed without stain, for God will judge that fornicate and that break marriage.	Nai vesta nauva alcarvalda mici illi, ar i vestacaima ú vaxeo, an Eru namuva i úpuhtar ar i racir vesta.
"May your manner of life be without love of money, while you think about the things that exist now, as sufficient for you. For he has said: ""I shall by no means leave you and by no means pass away from you."""	"Nai lélda coiviéno nauva ú melmeo telpeva, íre sanalde pa i nati yar ear sí ve fárie len. An equéties: ""Laume hehtuvanyes ar laume autuvan lyello."""
"Therefore we may have courage and say: ""The Lord helps me; I shall not fear. What can man do to me?"""	"Etta lertalve same huore ar quete: ""I Héru ni-manya; uan rucuva. Mana pole atan care nin?"""
Heed those that lead you, that have spoken God's word to you, and when you think of the fruit of their behavior, follow their faith.	Cima i tulyar le, i equétier Eruo quetta lenna, ar íre sanalde pa lengielto yáve, á hilya savielta.
Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.	Yésus Hristo ná i imya noa ar síra ar tennoio.
Do not be carried away by different and strange teachings, for is beneficial to the heart to be made firm in grace, not by food, which has not been beneficial to those that heed it.	Áva na cóline oa lo alavéle ar ettelie peantier, an ná aşea i endan náve carna tanca Erulissenen, lá matsonen, ya ua anaie aşea in cimir ta.
We have an alter from which that serve at the tent may not eat.	Samilve yangwa yallo i veuyar ara i lancoa uar lerta mate.
For the bodies of the animals the blood of which is brought into the holy place by the chief priest, are burnt on the outside of the camp.	An i hroar i celvaron ion serce ná talaina mir i aire nóme lo i héra airimo, nar urtaine ettesse i estoliéno.
Thus also Jesus, for him to hallow the people by his own blood, suffered on the outside of the gate.	Sie yando Yésus, airitieryan i lie véra serceryanen, perpére ettesse i ando.
Therefore let us go to him outside of the camp, bearing the shameful speech that he bore,	Etta alve lelya senna ettesse i estoliéno, cólala i naityala carpie ya sé colle,
for we do not here have a city that remains, but we seek that which shall come.	an ualve same sisse osto ya lemya, mal cestalve ta ya tuluva.
Through him let us always sacrifice to God a sacrifice of praise, that is, fruit from lips that confess his name.	Ter sé alve illume yace Erun yanca laitaléva, ta ná, yáve ho péli yar etequentar esserya.
Furthermore, do not let the doing of good or the giving to others slip from your mind, for they are sacrifices that are desirable to God.	Ente, áva lave i carien márieva hya i antien exin talta sámaldallo, an tai nar yancali yar nar írime Erun.
Stick to the commands of that lead you and submit yourselves to them, for they watch your souls as persons that will give a reckoning; thus it will be possible to them to do this with joy and not with sighing, for that is not beneficial to you.	Á himya i canwar ion tulyar le ar á panya inde nu te, an tirilte fealdar ve queneli i antuvar onótie; sie ecuva tien care si arwe alasseo ar lá arwe siquiléo, an ta ua aşea len.
Pray for us, for we are sure that we have a good conscience, wishing to behave well in all matters.	Hyama elmen, an nalme tance i samilme mára immotuntie, mérala lenga mai mi ilye nattor.
But we urge that you do this above all, for me to return to you the sooner .	Mal hortan i carilde si or ilqua, entulienyan lenna ta ambe rato.
Now may the God of peace, who brought up from dead the great shepherd of sheep having the blood of an eternal covenant,	Sí nai i Aino raineva, ye talle ama qualinillon i túra mavar mámaron arwa i serceo oira véreo, Yésus Herulva,
give you every good thing as tools to do his will, doing in us by Jesus Christ what is good in his eyes. May there be for him the glory forever and ever! Amen!	antuva len ilya mána ve carmar carien indómerya, cárala vesse Yésus Hristonen ya ná mára henyatse. Nai euva sen i alcar tennoio ar oi! Násie.
Now I urge you, brothers, that you bear this word of urging, for I send you a letter of few words.	Sí hortan le, hánor, i colilde quetta sina hortaléva, an mentan len tenna mance quettalíva.
Know that Timothy, our brother, has been released. If he comes quickly, I shall see you with him.	Á ista i Timoşéo, hánolva, anaie etelehtaina. Qui tulis lintiénen, le-cenuvan óse.
Give my greeting to all that lead you, and to all the holy ones. that are in Italy greet you.	Á anta suilienya illin i tulyar le, ar ilye i airin. I ear Italiasse suilar le.
May the grace of God be with all among you!	Nai i Erulisse euva as illi mici le!
James , slave of God and the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelves tribes that are scattered: Greetings! 	Yácov, Eruo ar i Heru Yésus Hristo mól, i nossin yunque yar nar vintaine: Hara máriesse!
My brothers, when you meet tests of all kinds, count all those as pure joy,	Hánonyar, íre samilde tyastier ilye nostaleron, nota ilye tai ve poica alasse,
knowing, as you do, that your tested faith works endurance.	istala, ve carilde, i tyastaina savielda care voronwe.
But let endurance complete its work, for you to be perfect and completed in all things, lacking nothing.	Mal lava voronwen telya mótierya, náveldan ilvane ar telyaine ilye natassen, pénala munta.
Thus, if anyone among you lacks knowledge, may he ask of God, who gives to all, willing and without harsh words, and wisdom will be given to him.	Sie, qui aiquen mici le pene sailie, nai arcuvas Erullo, ye anta illin, mérala ar ú narace quettaron, ar sailie nauva sen antaina.
But may he ask in faith, entirely without uncertain thoughts, for who is uncertain is like a wave of sea, sent by the wind and blown hither and thither.	Mal nai arcas saviesse, aqua ú iltance sanwion, an ye ná iltanca ná ve falma earo, mentaina i súrinen ar vávaina sir yo tar.
Do not let such a man suppose that he will receive anything from God;	Áva lave taite neren intya i camuvas aiqua i Herullo;
he is a man of a double mind, unsteady in all his ways.	náse nér atwa sámo, iltanca ilye malleryassen.
But may the lowly brother have joy since he is made exalted,	Mal nai i nalda háno samuva alasse pan náse carna arta,
and the rich since he is humbled, for like a flower of the grass he shall pass away.	ar i lára pan náse nucumna, an ve lóte i salqueo autuvas.
For the Sun rises in heat, and it withers the grass, and its flower falls off , and its beautiful appearance fades . Thus also the rich person will fade in the midst of his pursuits.	An Anar orta mi úre, ar hestas i salque, ar lóterya lanta oa ar vanima ilcerya fire. Sie yando i lára quén fifirúva endesse roitieryaron.
Happy is the man who endures in test, for wholly tested he shall receive the crown of life, concerning which the Lord has given promise to who love him.	Valima ná i nér ye perpere tyastiesse, an aqua tyestaina camuvas i ríe coiviéva, pa ya i Heru ánie vanda in melir se.
"May a person who is tested not be saying: ""I am tested by God."" For God cannot be tested by evil; furthermore, he does not test anyone."	"Nai quén ye ná tyestaina ua quéta: ""Nanye tyestaina lo Eru."" An Eru ua tyestima ulcunen; ente, sé ua tyasta aiquen."
But everyone is tested by being drawn and tempted by his own lust.	Mal ilquen ná tyestaina návenen túcina ar ºahtaina véra maileryanen.
Then the lust, when it conceives, bears sin, and when the sin has been done, it causes death.	Tá i maile, íre nostas, cole úcare, ar íre i úcare anaie cárina, tyaris qualme.
Let no one cause you to stray, my beloved brothers!	Lava úquenen tyare le ranya, melde hánonyar!
Every good thing given and every perfect gift comes from on high, for it comes down from the Father of lights: Concerning him there is nothing that changes or a shadow that moves.	Ilya mára nat antaina ar ilya ilvana anna tule tarmenello, an tulis undu calaron Atarello: Pa sé ea munta ya ahya hya leo ya leve.
Since he wished, he caused us to exist by the word of truth, for us to be first fruits of his creatures.	Pan mernes, vi-tyarnes ea i quettanen nanwiéno, návelvan minye yáveli onnaryaron.
Do know this thing, my beloved brothers: For every man it is necessary to be quick about hearing, slow about speaking, slow about wrath;	Á ista nat sina, melde hánonyar: Ilya atanen mauya náve linta pa hlarie, lenca pa quetie, lenca pa orme;
for a man's wrath does not make God's justice come.	an atano orme ua tyare Eruo failie tule.
Therefore put away every filthiness and evil, for there is no need for evil. Gently receive the implanting of the word which can save your souls!	Etta á panya oa ilya soa ar ulco, an ua ea maure ulcuva. Moicave cama i empanie i quettava ya pole rehta fealdar!
But be doers of the word, not solely hearers, causing yourselves to stray.	Mal na carindoli i quetto, lá eryave hlarindoli, tyárala inde ranya.
For if anyone is a hearer of the word, and not a doer, that person is like a man who looks at the face of his body in a looking-glass .	An qui aiquen ná hlarindo i quetto, ar lá carindo, sana quén ná ve nér ye yéta hroaryo cendele cilintillanen.
For he looks at himself, but in the moment that he goes away, his appearance slips from his memory.	An yétas inse, mal mí lú ya autas, ilcerya talta réneryallo.
But who inquires into the perfect law of freedom, and endures in it – since he has made himself, not a hearer that recalls nothing, but a doer of labour – will be happy in his labour.	Mal ye ceºe i ilvana ºanye lériéva, ar perpere sasse – pan acáries inse, lá hlarindo ye enyale munta, mal carindo moliéno – nauva valima molieryasse.
If anyone thinks of himself as a worshiper, and yet he does not control his tongue, but lets his heart stray, then this person's worship is empty.	Qui aiquen sana pa inse ve tyerindo, ananta uas ture lambarya, mal lave endaryan ranya, tá quén sino tyerme ná cumna.
The worship that is clean and without stain to our God the Father is this: Heeding the needs of children without parents and of widows in their tribulation, and keeping himself without stain from the world.	I tyerme ya ná poica ar ú vaxeo Ainolva i Ataren ná si: Cimie i mauri hínion ú ontaruo ar verulóraron ºangieltasse, ar hepie immo ú vaxeo i mardello.
My brothers, surely you do not heed faces at the same time that you believe in Jesus Christ our Lord?	Hánonyar, lau cimilde cendeler mí imya lúme ya savilde mi Yésus Hristo Herulva?
For if a man comes to your meeting, having rings of gold and a splendid raiment, but a poor person in a dirty raiment also comes,	An qui nér tule yomenieldanna, arwa cormalion maltava ar maira larmo, mal penya quén vára larmasse yando tule,
"and with joy you receive who has the splendid raiment and say: ""You sit here in a prominent place!"", but you say to the poor one: ""You may stand!"", or ""Sit there by the support for my feet"" –"	"ar mi alasse camilde ye cole i maira larma ar quetir: ""Elye hama sisse minda nómesse!"", mal quetilde i penyanna: ""Elyen ece tare"", hya: ""Hama tasse ara i tulco talunyant"""
then you count some among you more precious than others, and you are judges that pronounce wicked judgements. Is this not true?	– tá notilde quelli mici le mirwe lá exeli, ar nalde námoli i quetir olce námier. Ma si ua nanwa?
Listen, my beloved: Did God not choose the poor ones of this world for them to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom, concerning which he gave a promise to those who love him?	Á lasta, meldanyar: Ma Eru ua cille mar sino penyar náveltan láre saviesse ar aryoni i araniéno, pa ya antanes vanda in melir se?
But you have denied the poor one his respect. Do rich people not oppress you and drag you before judges?	Mal elde alálier i penyan áyarya. Ma láre queni uar lumna len ar tucir le epe námor?
Do they not speak against the name by which you were called?	Ma ualte nanquete i essenen yanen anelde yáline?
"You do well if indeed you behave by the royal law, as the Scriptures say: ""Love your neighbor as yourself."""	"Carilde mai qui é lengalde i arna ºanyenen, ve i Tehtele quete: ""Mela armarolya ve imle."""
But if you heed faces , you sin, since you receive a rebuke from the Law, about breaking it.	Mal qui cimilde cendeler, úcarilde, pan camilde tulcarpie i ªanyello, pa racie sa.
For anyone who keeps the entire Law, but fails concerning a single thing, he has broken all the commandments.	An aiquen ye himya i quanda ªanye, mal loita pa erya nat, arácie ilye i axani.
"For who said: ""Do not fornicate!"", also said: ""Do not kill!"" If you do not fornicate, but you do kill, you have broken the Law."	"An ye quente: ""Ávalye úpuhta!"", yando quente: ""Áva nahta!"" Qui ual úpuhta, mal é nahtal, aráciel i ªanye."
Like people that will be judged by the law of freedom, so you are to talk, and so you are to behave!	Ve queni i nauvar námine i ºanyenen lériéva, sie alde carpa, ar sie alde lenga!
For who does not do mercy, will receive judgement without mercy. With triumphant cries mercy is conquering judgement.	An ye ua care oravie, camuva námie ú óraviéno. Yellolissen oravie túrua namie.
How is beneficial, my brothers, if a person says that he has faith, but he does not have acts? Surely the faith cannot save him?	Manen ná aºea, hánonyar, qui quén quete i samis savie, mal uas same cardar? Lau i savie pole rehta se?
If a brother or a sister is naked and lacks bread for the day,	Qui háno hya néºa ná helda ar pene matso i auren,
"and yet person among you says to them: ""Go in peace, be warm and filled"", but he does not give to them their body's needs, how is that beneficial?"	"ananta quén mici le quete téna: ""Mena rainesse, na lauca ar quátina"", mal uas anta tien hroalto mauri, manen ta ná aºea?"
Thus faith as well, if it does not have acts, is in itself dead..	Sie yando savie, qui uas same cardar, ná insasse qualin.
"And yet a person will perhaps say: ""You have faith, and I have acts."" Show me your faith except by acts, and I shall show you my faith by my acts!"	"Ananta quén cé quetuva: ""Elye same savie, ar inye same cardar."" Ánin tana savielda hequa cardainen, ar inye lyen-tanuva savienya cardanyainen!"
You believe that there is one God, no? You do well. The demons as well believe – and tremble!	Savil i ea Eru er, lá? Caril mai. Yando i raucor savir – ar palir!
But do you want to know, o empty man, that without acts faith does nothing good?	Mal ma meril ista, a cumna atan, i ú cardaron savie care munta mára?
Was Abraham our father not pronounced just after he sacrificed Isaac his son on the altar?	Ma Avraham atarelva úne quétina faila apa yances Ísac yondorya i yangwasse?
As you see, his faith worked with is acts, and by his acts his faith was made perfect.	Ve cenil, savierya móle as cardaryar, ar cardaryainen savierya náne carna ilvana.
"Thus the scripture was fulfilled which says: ""Abraham believed in the Lord, and that was counted to him as righteousness"", and he was called ""friend of the Lord""."	"Sie i tehtele náne amaquátina ya quete: ""Avraham sáve i Hérusse, ar ta náne nótina sen ve failie"", ar anes estaina ""i Héruo meldo""."
You see that a person is justified by acts, and not by faith alone.	Cenil i ná quén failanta cardainen, ar lá saviénen erinqua.
In the same manner, was Rahab the harlot not justified by acts, after she received the spies and sent them away by another road?	Mí imya lé, ma Ráhav i imbacinde úne failanta cardalínen, apa camnes i larmor ar mentaner te oa hyana mallenen?
Like the body is dead without breath, so also faith without acts is dead.	Ve i hroa ná qualin ú ºúleo, sie yando savie ú cardaron ná qualin.
Do not let numerous ones among you be teachers, my brothers, for you know that we shall receive a heavier judgement.	Áva lave rimbalin mici le náve peantari, hánonyar, an istalde i camuvalve ambe lunga námie.
For all among us slip frequently. If anyone does not slip in a word, he is a perfect man, who can also control his entire body.	An illi mici vi taltar rimbave. Qui aiquen ua talta quettasse, sé ná ilvana nér, ye yando pole ture quanda hroarya.
If we put bridles into the mouths of horses, for them to do as we want, we control also their entire body.	Qui panyalve pérappar mir roccoron antor, carieltan ve merilve, mahtalve yando quanda hroalta.
Behold! Also ships, though they are that big and mighty winds cause them to move, are controlled by a very small rudder, to where the helmsman wants.	Yé! Yando ciryar, ómu nalte ta hoe ar taure súri tyarir tai leve, nar túrine ampitya tullanen, yanna i ciryaher mere.
Thus the tongue as well is a small body-part, and yet it boasts greatly. Behold, how small is the fire that can kindle so great a wood!	Sie yando i lamba ná pitya hroaranta, ananta laitaxe ita. Yé, manen pitya ná i náre ya pole narta ta hoa taure!
And the tongue is a fire! The tongue is a world of unrighteousness among our body-parts, for it defiles the entire body and kindles the wheel of life, and it is kindled by Gehenna.	Ar i lamba ná náre! I lamba ná mar úfailiéva mici hroarantalvar, an vahtas i quanda hroa ar narta i querma coiviéva, ar sá ná nartaina Ehennanen.
For every kind of wild animals and of birds and of reptiles and of creatures in sea have ben made servants of Men.	An ilya nostale hravani celvaron ar aiwion ar hlócion ar onnaron earesse anaier cárine núror Atanion.
But the tongue – there is no one among Men who can make it his servant. An unruly, evil thing, it is full of death-bringing poison.	Mal i lamba – ea úquen mici Atani ye pole care sá núrorya. Útúrima, ulca nat, nas quanta qualmetúlula hloimo.
By it we bless the Lord and Father, and yet by it we also curse men that are created in God's image.	Sánen aistalve i Héru ar Atar, ananta sánen yando hútalve atani i nar ontaine Eruo emmasse.
From the same mouth come blessing and curse.It is not good, my brothers, that these things occur so.	Et i imya antollo tulir aistie ar hútie. Ua mára, hánonyar, i nati sine martar sie.
In a spring, sweet and bitter water does not flow from the same hole, no?	Ehtelesse, lisse ar sára nén ua ulya i imya assallo, lá?
My brothers, a fig tree does not give olives, or a vine figs, no? In the same manner, salt water cannot give sweet water.	Hánonyar, relyávalda ua pole anta milpior, hya liantasse relyávi, lá? Mí imya lé, singwa nén ua pole anta lisse nén.
Who is wise and intelligent among you? May he show his deeds by his good conduct, by the gentle manner of wisdom.	Man ná saila ar handa mici le? Nai tanuvas cardaryar mára lengieryanen, i milya lénen sailiéva.
But if you have a bitter envy and a love of quarreling in your heart, do not praise yourselves and speak lies against the truth.	Mal qui samilde sára hrúcen ar melme costiéva endaldasse, áva laita inde ar queta huruli i nanwienna.
This is not the love that comes from on high, but it is from earth – animal-like, demonic.	Si ua i melme ya tule tarmenello, mal nas cemello – celvavea, raucea.
For where there is envy and a love of quarreling, there is unorder and every foul thing.	An yasse ear hrúcen ar melme costiéva, tasse ear úpartale ar ilya ºaura nat.
But the wisdom from on high is above everything clean. Furthermore, it loves peace, it is gentle, it heeds the will of others, it is full of mercy and of good fruits, it does not heed faces , it is not hypocritical ,	Mal i sailie tarmenello ná or ilqua poica. Ente, melis raine, nas milya, cimis exion nirme, nas quanta óraviéno ar máre yávion, uas cime cendeler, uas imnetyala,
but the seed of fruit of righteousness is sown in peace for that make peace.	mal i erde yáveo failiéva ná rérina rainesse in carir raine.
For from where come wars, from where are there quarrels among you? Do they not come from here: from your lusts, that make war in your body-parts?	An mallo tulir ohtali, mallo ear costiéli mici le? Ma ualte tule silo: maileldallon, i ohtacarir mi hroarantaldar?
You desire, but you do not have. You slay and you long, and yet you cannot receive. You fight and you make war. You do not have, since you do not ask.	Merilde, mal ualde same. Nahtalde ar milyalde, ananta ualde pole came. Mahtalde ar ohtacarilde. Ualde same, pan ualde arca.
You ask , and yet you do not receive, for you ask for a wrong reason, to use it on your lust for the joys of the flesh.	Arcalde, ananta ualde came, an arcalde &perqua castanen, sa-yuhtien maileldasse alassiva i hráveo.
You who break marriage, do you not know that if one is friendly to the world, one is hostile to God?	Elde i racir vestale, ma ualde ista i qui mo ná nilda i marden, mo ná cotya Erun?
Therefore, anyone who wishes to be the world's friend makes himself an enemy of God.	Etta, aiquen ye mere náve meldo i mardo care inse ñotto Eruo.
"Or if you think that without reason the Scripture says: ""By envy the spirit that dwells in us is longing"" – ?"	"Hya ma sanalde i ú cesto i Tehtele quete: ""Hrucennen i faire ya mare vesse milyea"" – ?"
"But greater is the grace that he gives. Therefore he says: ""God stands against the haughty ones, but he gives grace to the lowly ones."""	"Mal ambe túra ná i Erulisse ya antas. Etta quetis: ""Eru tare i &turquimannar, mal antas lisse i naldain."""
Therefore submit yourselves to God, but stand against the Devil, and he shall flee from you.	Etta á panya inde nu Eru, mal tara i Arauconna, ar uºuvas lello.
Come near to God, and he shall come near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and make your heart pure, you having a double mind.	Tula hare Erunna, ar tuluvas hare lenna. Á poita máldat, a úcarindor, ar cara endalda poica, le arwe atwa sámo.
Give yourselves to misery, have grief, let your tears flow! May your laughter change into lamenting, and your joy into grief!	Á anta inde angayassen, sama nyére, lava níreldain ulya! Nai lalielda ahyuva mir nainie, ar alasselda mir nyére!
Humble yourselves in the Lord's eyes, and he shall rise you up.	Nucuma inde mí Héruo hendu, ar le-ortuvas ama.
Do not speak evil one about the other, brothers! who speaks evil about a brother or judges his brother speaks against law and judges law. But if you judge law, you are not a doer of law, but a judge.	Áva quete ulco quén pa i exe, hánor! Ye quete ulco pa háno hya name hánorya quete ana ºanye ar name ºanye. Mal qui namil ºanye, ual carindo ºanyeo, mal námo.
There is One who gave the law and is a judge, he who can save and undo. But you, how may you judge your neighbor?	Ea Er ye antane i ªanye ar ná námo, sé ye pole rehta ar nancare. Mal elye, manen lertal name armarolya?
"Come, now, you who say: ""Today or tomorrow we will go to this city and we will remain there for a year, and we shall trade and make money"" – and you do not know how your life will be tomorrow! For you are a mist, seen for a short moment and then disappearing."	"Tula, sí, elde i quetir: ""Síra hya enwa lelyuvalve osto sinanna ar lemyuvalve tasse ter loa, ar mancuvalve ar caruvar telpe"" – ar elde uar ista manen coivielda nauva enwa! An nalde híºie, cénina mi ºinta lú ar tá autala."
"Instead, you did well if you said: ""If the Lord wants, we shall still be alive and also do this or that."""	"Mí men, carnelde mai qui quentelde: ""Qui i Heru mere, nauvalve en coirie ar yando care si hya ta."""
But now you have pride by your boasts . All such boasting is wicked.	Mal sí samilde valate immolaitieldainen. Ilya taite immolaitie ná olca.
Therefore, if a person knows to do what is right, and yet he does not do it, that is to him a sin.	Etta, qui quén ista care ya ná vanima, ananta uas care sa, ta ná sen úcare.
Come, now, you who are rich; in tears lament about the griefs that are coming upon you!	Tula, sí, elde i nar láre; nírelissen á naina pa i nyéri yar túlar lenna!
Your riches have crumbled, and your raiments are eaten by moths;	Larelda uruxie, ar larmaldar nar mátine lo malwi;
the gold and the silver are eroded into dust, and the dust shall witness against you and shall consume your body. It is like fire, that which you have gathered in the last days!	i malta yo i telpe nar nwárine mir asto, ar i asto vettuva lenna ar ammatuva hroalda. Nas ve náre, ta ya ocómielde i métime auressen!
Hear! The payment for which the people that reaped your fields have laboured, but which you have kept, is crying against you! The reapers' cries have come to the ears of the Lord of Hosts.	Hlara! I paityale yan i queni i cirihtaner restaldar omótier, mal ya elde ehépier, yáma lenna! I cirihtoron rambi utúlier hlarunna i Héruo Hossion.
On earth you have had abundance and a life of lust. On the day of slaughter you have made your heart fat. You have judged, you have slain the just one; he did not stop you.	Cemende asámielde úve ar coivie maileva. I auresse nahtiéva acárielde endalda tiuca. Anámielde, anahtielde i faila; uas pustane le.
Have patience, then, until the Lord comes! A farmer looks forward to earth's precious fruit; it is necessary for him to have patience until the rain has fallen in autumn and spring alike.	Sama cóle, tá, tenna i Heru tule! Cemendur yéta ompa cemeno mirwa yávenna; mauya sen same cóle tenna i miste alantie mi quelle ar tuile véla.
Thus it is necessary also for you to have patience and courage, for the Lord's coming is near.	Sie mauya yando len same cóle ar huore, an i Heruo tulesse ná hare.
Do not sigh one at the other, or maybe you will be judged. Behold! The Judge is standing before the doors.	Áva sique quén i exenna, hya cé nauvalde námine. Yé! I Námo tára epe i fennar.
Brothers, learn from the manner in which the prophets – who spoke in the Lord's name – endured evil and had patience.	Hánor, para ho i lé yasse i Erutercánoron – i caramper mí Héruo esse – perpérer ulco ar sámer cóle.
Behold, we name happy who have endured! You have heard or the steadfastness of Job and know the final end that the Lord gave, how the Lord has deep sympathy and is full of grace.	Yé, estalve valime i eperpérier! Ahlárielde pa voronwerya Yóv ar istar i manar ya i Héru antane, manen i Héru same núra ofelme ar ná quanta lisseo.
"Above everything, my brothers, do not give oaths – by heaven or by earth or by every other oath. May you say ""yes, yes"" – ""no, no"", or you will fall under judgement."	"Or ilqua, hánonyar, áva anta vandar – menelden hya cemennen hya ilya hyana vandanen. Nai quetilde ""ná, ná"" – ""vá, vá"", hya lantuvalde nu námie."
But is there anyone that has hardship? Let him pray ! But is there anyone having joy? Let him sing psalms! .	Ma ea aiquen mici le ye same perperie? Nai hyamuvas! Mal ea aiquen arwa alasseo? Nai linduvas airelíri!
Is there anyone sick among you? Let him call the elders of the congregation, for them to pray over him, annointing him with oil by the Lord's name.	Ma ea aiquen hlaiwa mici le? Nai yaluvas i amyárar i ocombeo, hyamieltan or se, lívala se millonen i Héruo essenen.
And the prayer of faith will bring health to the bed-ridden one, and the Lord shall raise him up. Furthermore, if he has done sins, that will be forgiven him.	Ar i hyamie saviéva tulúva mále i caimeassean, ar i Héru ortuva se. Ente, qui acáries úcareli, ta nauva sen apsénina.
Therefore speak openly, one to the other, about your sins; and pray one for the other, for you to be healed. A just person's petition carries abundant power when it is at work.	Etta queta pantave, quén i exenna, pa úcareldar; ar hyama quén i exen, náveldan nestaine. Faila queno arcande cole úvea túre íre móteas.
Elijah was a man having the same fealings that we have, and yet in prayer he asked that would not fall rain, and rain did not fall for three years and six months.	Elía náne nér arwa i imye felmion yar elve samir, ananta hyamiesse arcanes i ua lantumne miste, ar miste ua lantane ter loar nelde ar astar enque.
And he prayed again, and heaven gave rain and the land bore its fruit.	Ar hyamnes ata, ar menel antane miste ar i nóre colle yáverya.
My brothers, if anyone among you is caused to stray from the truth and another turns him back,	Hánonyar, qui aiquen mici le ná tyárina ranya i nanwiello ar exe nanquere se,
know this: Anyone that turns a sinner from the error of his way will save his soul from death and will cover a host of sins.	á ista si: Aiquen ye quere úcarindo malleryo loimallo rehtuva fearya qualmello ar tupuva liyúme úcarelion.
In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.	I yestasse enge i Quetta, ar i Quetta enge as Eru, ar i Quetta né Eru.
He was in the beginning with God.	Sé enge i yestasse as Eru.
Everything was created by means of him, and except by him not a single thing was created. which was created	Ilqua né ontaina sénen, ar hequa sénen erya nat úme ontaina. Ya né ontaina
by him was life, and the life was the light of men.	sénen coivie né, ar i coivie náne Atanion cala.
And the light shines in the darkness, but the darkness has not conquered it.	Ar i cala calta i morniesse, mal i mornie lá orutúrie sa.
 arose a man sent by God; his name was John .	Oronte nér mentaina lo Eru; esserya né Yoháno.
He came for a witness, that he was to witness about the light, that all men were going to believe by means of him.	Sé túle vettien, i vettumnes pa i cala, i savumner sénen ilye atani.
He was not this light, but he was to witness about this light.	Lá anes cala sina, mal vettumnes pa cala sina.
The true light, shining for all men, was coming into the world.	I nanwa cala, caltala ilye atanin, né túlala mir i mar.
He was in the world, and the world was created by him, but the world did not know him.	Enges i mardesse, ar i mar né ontaina sénen, mal i mar ua sinte se.
He came to his own, but his own did not receive him.	Túles i véranna, mal véraryar uar camne se.
But all who did receive him, to them he gave authority to be children of God, for they had faith in his name;	Mal illi i é se-camner, tien antanes hére náven hínali Eruo, an sámelte savie esseryasse;
and they were born, not by blood or by flesh or by man’s will, but by God.	ar anelte nóne, lá sercenen hya hrávenen hya nero şelmanen, mal Erunen.
And the Word changed into flesh and dwelt among us, and we saw his glory, such glory as an only-born son has from his father; and he was full of grace and truth.	Ar i Quetta ahyane mir hráve ar marne imíca me, ar cennelme alcarerya, taite alcar ya ernóna yondo same ataryallo; ar anes quanta Erulisseo ar nanwiéno.
John witnessed about him; indeed he cried out: “This man is the one of whom I said: who comes behind me is now in front of me, since he existed before me.”	Yoháno vettane pa se, é etyámes: “Nér sina ná i quén pa ye quenten: Ye túle ca ni ná sí opo ni, pan enges nó ni.”
For we all received out of his fullness, grace over grace.	An camnelme illi et quantieryallo, lisse or lisse.
For the Law was given through Moses, but the grace and the truth came through Jesus Christ.	An i Şanye náne antaina ter Móses, mal i lisse ar i nanwie túler ter Yésus Hristo.
God nobody has ever seen; the only-born Son who is in the Father’s bosom has made him known.	Eru úquen oi ecénie; i ernóna Yondo ye ea i Ataro súmasse acárie se sinwa.
This is the witness of John when the Jews sent some priests and Levites from Jerusalem to inquire of him: “Who are you?”	Si ná Yoháno vette íre i Yúrar mentaner airimóli ar Levindeli Yerúsalemello ceşien se: “Man nalye?”
And he confessed and did not deny , but confessed: “I am not the Christ.”	Ar etequentanes ar ua lalane, mal etequentane: “Uan i Hristo.”
And they asked him: “Then what? Are you Elijah?” And he said: “I am not.” “Are you the Prophet?” And he answered: “No!”	Ar cenşeltes: “Tá mana? Ma nalye Elía?” Ar eques: “Uan.” “Ma nalye i Erutercáno?” Ar hanquentes: “Lá!”
Therefore they said to him: “Who are you? Let us have an answer for those who sent us. What do you say about self?”	Etta quentelte senna: “Man nalye? Lava men same hanquenta in mentaner me. Mana quetil pa immo?”
He said: “I am a voice crying in the desert: Make the Lord’s way straight! – as Isaiah the Prophet said.”	Eques: “Nanye óma yámala i erumasse: Cara i Héruo malle téra! – tambe Yesaia i Erutercáno quente.”
The ones sent were of the Pharisees.	I mentainar náner i Farisaron.
And they asked and said to him: “Then what is the reason that you baptize, if you are not the Christ or Elijah or the Prophet?”	Ar cenşelte ar quenter senna: “Tá mana i casta yanen tumyal, qui umilye i Hristo hya Elía hya i Erutercáno?”
John answered and said: “I baptize with water; in your midst one is standing whom you do not know,	Yoháno hanquente ar eque: “Inye tumya nennen; endeldasse quén tára ye lé uar ista,
" who comes after me, but I am not worthy to loosen the strap of his shoe."""	ye túla ca ni, mal inye ui valda lehtien i latta hyapatyo.”
These things happened in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.	Nati sine martaner Vetaniasse Yordan pella, yasse tumyane Yoháno.
On the following day he saw Jesus come to him, and he said: “Behold God’s Lamb who takes away the world’s sin!	I hilyala auresse cennes Yésus túla senna, ar eques: “Ela Eruo Eule ye mapa oa i mardo úcare!
He is the one of whom I said: Look! A man is coming who is now in front of me, for before me he existed.	Sé ná i quén pa ye quenten: Yé! Túla nér ye sí ná opo ni, an nó ni enges.
I did not know him, but I came baptizing with water that he was to be revealed to Israel.”	Inye ua sinte se, mal túlen tumyala nennen i sé umne apantaina Israélen.”
John also witnessed, saying: “I saw the Spirit come down out of heaven as a dove, and it remained on him.	Yoháno yando vettane, quétala: “Cennen i Faire túla undu et menello ve cucua, ar lemyanes sesse.
And I did not know him, but who sent me to baptize with water said to me: The one to whom you shall see the Spirit come down as a dove, he is who baptizes with Holy Spirit.	Ar inye ua sinte se, mal ye ni-mentane tumien nennen quente ninna: I quén yenna cenuval i Faire túla undu ve cucua, sé ná ye tumya Aire Feanen.
And I have seen it, and I have witnessed that he is the Son of God.”	Ar inye ecénie sa, ar evettien i sé ná i Eruion.”
On the following day John again stood with two of his disciples,	I hilyala auresse ata tarne Yoháno as atta hildoryaron,
and seeing Jesus walking he said: “Behold God’s Lamb!”	ar cénala Yésus vantea eques: “Ela Eruo Eule!”
And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.	Ar i hildo atta hlasset se quéta, ar hilyanette Yésus.
But Jesus turned and saw them follow, and he said to them: “What are you seeking?” They said to him: “Rabbi” – which means teacher – “where are you staying?”	Mal Yésus querne immo ar cenne tú hilyea, ar quentes túna: “Mana cesteaste?” Tú quentet senna: “Ravi” – ya tea Peantar – “masse máral?”
He said to them: “Come and see!” Therefore they came and saw the place where he stayed, and they remained with him on that day. was around the tenth hour.	Eques túna: “Tula ar cena!” Etta túlette ar cennet i nóme yasse marnes, ar lemyanette óse aure yanasse. Náne os i quainea lúme.
Andrew , the brother of Simon Peter, was one of the two disciples who heard which John said and followed Jesus.	Andréas, hánorya Símon Péter, náne quén i hildo atto yet hlasset ya quente Yoháno ar hilyanet Yésus.
He found first his own brother, Simon, and said to him: “We have found Messiah!” – which means Christ.	Sé hirne minyave véra hánorya, Símon, ar eque senna: “Ihíriemme Messías” – ya tea Hristo.
He led him to Jesus. When Jesus saw him he said: “You are Simon son of John. You will be called Cephas” – which means Peter .	Se-tulyanes Yésunna. Íre Yésus se-cenne eques: “Elye ná Símon Yohannion. Elye nauva estaina Céfas” – ya tea Péter .
On the following day he wanted to go to Galilee . Jesus found Philip and said to him: “Follow me!”	I hilyala auresse mernes mene Alileanna. Yésus hirne Filip ar quente senna: “Áni hilya!”
Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.	Filip náne Vetsairallo, i osto Andreas ar Pétero.
Philip found Nathanael and said to him: “We have found the one of whom Moses in the Law and the Prophets wrote: Jesus son of Joseph from Nazareth.”	Filip hirne Natanael ar quente senna: “Ihírielme i quén pa ye Móses i Şanyesse ar i Erutercánor tencer: Yésus Yosefion Nasaretello.”
But Nathanael said to him: “Can anything good come from Nazareth?”	Mal eque senna Natanael: “Ma aiqua mára pole tule Nasaretello?”
Jesus saw Nathanael come to him and said of him: “Behold a true Israelite, in whom there is no deceit !”	Yésus cenne Natanael túla senna ar quente pa se: “Ela nanwa Israelinde, yesse lá ea vartie!”
Nathanael said to him: “How do you know me?” Jesus answered and said: “Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.”	Eque senna Natanael: “Manen elye ista ní?” Yésus hanquente ar eque: “Nó Filip yalde lye, íre engel nu i relyávalda, lye-cennen.”
Nathanael answered him: “Rabbi, you are the Son of God, you are the King of Israel!”	Natanael hanquente senna: “Ravi, elye ná i Eruion, elye ná i Aran Israélo!”
Jesus answered and said: “Since I told you that I saw you under the fig tree you believe? You will see some things greater than that.”	Yésus hanquente ar eque: “Pan anyárien lyen i cennen lye nu i relyávalda savil? Cenuval natali túre lá ta.”
And he said to them: “Truly, truly I say to you: You will see heaven opened and God’s angels go up and down on the Son of Man.”	Ar eques téna: “Násie, násie quetin lenna: Cenuvalde menel latyaina ar Eruo valar ména amba ar undu i Atanyondosse.”
On the third day was a wedding in Cana of Galilee, and Jesus’ mother was there.	I neldea auresse enge veryanwe Cánasse Alileo, ar Yésuo amil náne tasse.
Also Jesus and his disciples were invited to the wedding.	Yando Yésus ar hildoryar náner nahamne i veryanwenna.
When they did not have more wine Jesus’ mother said to him: “They are lacking wine.”	Íre ualte sáme amba limpe Yésuo amil quente senna: “Pénalte limpe.”
But Jesus said to her: “Woman, what do I have with you? My hour still has not come.”	Mal eque senna Yésus: “Nís, mana samin asetye? Lúmenya en ua utúlie.”
His mother said to those who served: “Do anything that he says to you!”	Amillerya quente innar veuyaner: “Á care aiqua ya quetis lenna!”
 stood there six water-vessels, according to the laws of purification of Jews; each water-vessel could take two or three measures.	Tarner tasse calpar enque, ve i şanyer sovalleo Yúraron; ilya calpa polde mapa lestar atta hya nelde.
Jesus said to them: “Fill the water-vessels with water!” And they filled them brim full.	Eque téna Yésus: “Quata i calpar nennen!” Ar quanteltet penquante.
And he said to them: “Draw from it and take it to the leader of the feast!” So they took it.	Ar eques téna: “Á calpa sallo ar ása mapa i merenturenna!” Sie nampeltes.
But when the leader of the feast tasted the water, which was changed into wine, but he did not know where it came from – though the ones who served knew – the leader of the feast called the bridegroom	Mal íre i merentur tyáve i nén, ya náne vistaina mir limpe, mal ua sinte yallo túles – ómu i veuyaner sinter – i merentur yalde i ender
and said to him: “Every other man first puts forth the good wine, and when people are drunk, the inferior. You have put aside the good wine until now.”	ar eque senna: “Ilya hyana nér etepanya minyave i mára limpe, ar íre queni nar limpunque, i faica. Elye asátie i mára limpe tenna sí.”
Jesus did this in Cana of Galilee as the beginning of his signs and revealed his glory, and his disciples believed in him.	Yésus carne si Cánasse Alileo ve i yesta tannaryaron ar apantane alcarerya, ar hildoryar sáver sesse.
Thereafter he and his mother and his disciples went down to Capernaum, but he did not remain there for many days.	Epeta sé ar amillerya ar hánoryar ar hildoryar lender undu Capernaumenna, mal ualte lemyane tasse ter rimbe aureli.
Now Jews’ Passover was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.	Sí Yúraron Lahtie né hare, ar Yésus lende amba Yerúsalemenna.
And he found in the temple those who sold oxen and sheep and doves and the money-changers on their seats.	Ar hirnes i cordasse i vancer mundor ar mámar ar cucuar ar i quaptandor hammaltassen.
After making a whip of some ropes, he threw them all out together with the sheep and oxen; he poured out the coins of the money-changers and overturned the tables.	Apa carie falampa rappalíva, hanteset illi etsenna as i mámar ar mundor; etulyanes i tyelpemittar i quaptandoiva ar nuquerne i sarnor.
And to those who sold doves he said: “Take these things away from here! Do not make the house of my Father a house of commerce!”	Ar innar vancer cucuar eques: “Á mapa nati sine oa sio! Áva care i coa Atarinyava coa mancaleo!”
The disciples recalled that is written: “The burning feeling for your house will eat me .”	Hildoryar enyalder i ná técina: “I uryala felme coalyan matuva ni.”
Then the Jews said to him: “What is the sign that you will show us, since you do these things?”	Tá i Yúrar quenter senna: “Mana i tanna ya tanuval men, pan caril nati sine?”
Jesus answered and said: “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.”	Yésus hanquente ar eque: “Nancara corda sina, ar auressen nelde enortuvanyes.”
Therefore the Jews said: “This temple was built over forty-six years, and you will raise it up in three days?”	Etta i Yúrar quenter: “Corda sina náne carastaina ter loar enque canaquean, ar elye enortuva sá auressen nelde?”
But he talked about the temple of his body.	Mal sé carampe pa i corda hroaryava.
Thus, after he was raised from dead, his disciples recalled that he said this, and they believed what the Scripture says and the word that Jesus spoke.	Sie, apa anes ortaina et qualinillon, hildoryar enyalder i quentes si, ar sávelte ya quete i Tehtele ar i quetta ya Yésus quente.
But when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover, at the festival, numerous ones believed in his name, since they saw the signs that he did.	Mal íre enges Yerúsalemesse i Lahtiesse, i aşaresse, rimbali sáver esseryasse, pan cennelte i tannar yar carnes.
But Jesus himself did not open his heart to them, for he knew them all, and because he did not have need that anyone was to witness about a man, for he knew what was in the man.	Ono Yésus immo ua pantane endarya tien, pan sinteset illi, ar pan uas sáme maure i aiquen vettumne pa atan, an sé sinte ya enge i atande.
There was a man of the Pharisees; his name was Nicodemus, a ruler of Jews.	Enge nér i Farisaron; esserya náne Nicorémus, turco Yúraron.
This man came to him in the night and said to him: “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God, for is nobody who can do these signs if God is not with him.”	Nér sina túle senna i lómisse ar eque senna: “Ravi, istalme i elye ná peantar túlienwa Erullo, an ea úquen ye pole care tannar sine qui Eru ui óse.”
Jesus answered and said to him: “Truly, truly I say to you, if anyone is not reborn, he cannot see God’s kingdom.”	Yésus hanquente ar eque senna: “Násie, násie quetin lyenna, qui aiquen ui ennóna, uas pole cene Eruo aranie.”
Nicodemus said to him: “How can a person be born when he is old? Can he return to his mother’s womb to be born again?”	Eque senna Nicorémus: “Manen quén pole náve nóna íre náse yára? Ma polis nanwene amilleryo mónanna náven nóna ata?”
Jesus answered: “Truly, truly I say to you, if anybody is not born by water and by spirit, he cannot come into God’s kingdom.	Yésus hanquente: “Násie, násie quetin lyenna, qui aiquen ui nóna nennen ar fairenen, uas pole tule mir Eruo aranie.
What is born by flesh is flesh, and what is born by spirit is spirit.	Ya ná nóna hrávenen hráve ná, ar ya ná nóna fairenen faire ná.
Do not feel wonder because I said to you: You must be reborn.	Áva fele elmenda pan quenten lyenna: Mauya len náve ennóna.
The wind is blowing where it wants, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know where it comes from or where it is goes to. So is everone who is born by the spirit.”	I súre ná hlápula yasse meris, ar hlaril lammarya, mal ual ista yallo tulis hya yanna lelyas. Sie ná ilquen ye ná nóna i fairenen.”
Nicodemus answered and said to him: “How can these things happen?”	Nicorémus hanquente ar eque senna: “Manen nati sine polir marta?”
Jesus answered and said to him: “Are you Israel’s teacher and you do not know these things?	Yésus hanquente ar eque senna: “Ma elye ná peantar Israélo ar ual ista nati sine?
Truly, truly I say to you , what we know we speak and what we have seen we witness , but you do not receive our witness.	Násie, násie quetin lyenna, ya istalme quetilme ar ya ecénielme vettalme, mal lé uar came vettielma.
If I have told you about the things of earth and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you about the things of heaven?	Qui anyárien len pa i nati cemeno ar ualde save, manen savuvalde qui nyarin len pa i nati menelo?
Furthermore, nobody has gone up to heaven except who has come down from heaven, the Son of Man.	Ente, úquen eménie amba menelenna hequa ye utúlie undu menello, i Atanyondo.
And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert, so is necessary for the Son of Man to be lifted up,	Ar tambe Móses ortane i leuca i erumasse, sie mauya i Atanyondon náve ortaina,
that everybody who believes in him will have eternal life.	i ilquen ye save sesse samuva oira coivie.
For God has loved the world as far as giving his only-born Son, that everyone who believes in him shall not be destroyed, but shall have eternal life.	An Eru emélie i mar tenna antie ernóna Yondorya, i ilquen ye save sesse lá nauva nancarna, mal samuva oira coivie.
For God sent his Son, not that he was to judge the world, but that the world was to be saved by him.	An Eru mentane Yondorya, lá i namumnes i mar, mal i umne i mar rehtaina sénen.
 who believes in him shall not be judged. who does not believe has been judged even now, since he has not believed in the name of the only-born Son of God.	Ye save sesse lá nauva námina. Ye ua save anaie námina yando sí, pan uas asávie mí esse i ernóna Eruiono.
And this is the judgement, that the light has come into the world, but Men loved the darkness over the light, for their deeds are evil.	Ar si ná i námie, i utúlie i cala mir i mar, mal Atani méler i mornie or i cala, an cardaltar nar ulce.
And who does foul things hates the light and does not want to come to the light, that his deeds will not be reproved.	An ye care şaure nati yelta i cala ar ua mere tule i calanna, i cardaryar lá nauvar naityane.
But who indeed does what is true comes to the light, that will be manifest that his deeds are done in God.”	Mal ye é care ya ná nanwa tule i calanna, i nauva apantaina i cardaryar nar cárine Erusse.”
After these things Jesus and his disciples went to the Judean region, and there he remained with them and baptized.	Apa nati sine Yésus ar hildoryar lender i Yúrea ménanna, ar tasse lemyanes aselte ar tumyane.
John was baptizing in Aenon, near to Salim, since was an abundance of water there, and people came and were baptized,	Yoháno tumyane Ainonde, hare Salimenna, pan enge úve nenwa tasse, ar queni túler ar náner tumyaine,
for John still was not thrown into prison.	an Yoháno en úme hátina mir mando.
Then there was a quarrel between John’s disciples with a Jew concerning purification.	Tá enge costie imbi Yohanneo hildor as Yúra pa sovalle.
And they came to John and said to him: “Rabbi, the man who was with you beyond Jordan, about whom you witnessed, look! he is baptizing and all are going to him.”	Ar túlelte Yohannenna ar quenter senna: “Ravi, i nér ye enge aselye han Yordan, pa ye vettanel, yé! sé tumyea ar illi ménar senna.”
John answered and said: “A man cannot receive a single thing if it that is not given him from heaven.	Yoháno hanquente ar eque: “Atan ua pole came erya nat qui ta ui antaina sen menello.
You yourselves witness to me that I said: I am not the Christ, but I am sent in front of him.	Lé inde vettar nin i quenten: Inye ui i Hristo, mal nanye mentaina opo sé.
 who has the bride is the bridegroom. But the bridegroom’s friend, when he stands hearing him, has great joy when he hears the bridegroom’s voice. Thus this joy of mine is full.	Ye same i indis i ender ná. Mal i endero meldo, íre taris hlárala se, same túra alasse íre hlaris i endero óma. Sie sina alassenya ná quanta.
He will keep growing, but I will fade away.”	Sé aláluva, mal inye fifíruva.”
 who comes from on high is over all others. who is of earth is from earth, and he speaks of the things of earth. who comes from heaven is over all others.	Ye tule táriello ea or ilye exi. Ye ná cemeno cemello ná, ar quetis pa i nati cemeno. Ye tule menello ea or ilye exi.
What he has seen and he has heard, about that he witnesses, but no one receives his witness.	Ya ecénies ar ahláries, pa ta vettas, mal úquen came vettierya.
 who has received his witness has put his seal on the faithfulness of God.	Ye acámie vettierya apánie lihtarya i voronwesse Eruo.
For whom God sent speaks God’s sayings, for he does not give the Spirit by measure.	An ye Eru mentane quete Eruo quetier, an uas anta i Faire lestanen.
The Father loves the Son and has given all things into his hand.	I Atar mele i Yondo ar ánie ilye nati máryanna.
 who believes in the Son has eternal life; who does not do as the Son says will not see life, but God’s wrath remains upon him.	Ye save i Yondosse same oira coivie; ye ua care ve i Yondo quete ua cenuva coivie, mal Eruo rúşe lemya sesse.
When the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized disciples more numerous than the disciples of John –	Íre i Heru sinte i náner i Farisar hlárienwe i Yésus carne ar tumyane hildoli rimbe lá i hildor Yohanneo –
though Jesus did not baptize, but his disciples did –	ómu Yésus ua tumyane, mal hildoryar carner –
he went away from Judea and went again to Galilee.	oantes Yúreallo ar lende ata Alileanna.
But was necessary for him to go through Galilee.	Mal mauyane sen lelya ter Samária.
Therefore he came to a city of Samaria called Sychar, near to the field that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.	Etta túles ostonna Samário estaina Sícar, hare i restanna ya Yácov antane Yósef yondoryan.
There was Jacob’s spring. Thus Jesus, tired by the journey, sat down by the spring. The hour was around the sixth.	Tasse enge Yácovo ehtele. Sie Yésus, lumba i lendanen, hamne undu ara i ehtele. I lúme náne os i enquea.
A woman from Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her: “Give me a drink.”	Nís Samáriallo túle calpien. Yésus quente senna: “Ánin anta yulda.”
For his disciples had gone into the city to buy food.	An hildoryar náner autienwe mir i osto homancien matso.
Therefore the woman from Samaria said to him: “How do you, who are a Jew, ask for a drink from me who is a Samaritan woman?” For Jews and Samaritans have nothing together.	Etta i nís Samáriallo quente senna: “Manen elye, ye ná Yúra, arca yulda nillo ye ná Samárea nís?” An Yúrar ar Samárear samir munta uo.
Jesus answered and said to her: “If you knew God’s gift and true-being of who is saying to you: Give me a drink, you asked him, and he gave you living water.”	Yésus hanquente ar eque senna: “Qui sintel Eruo anna ar nasse yeo quéta lyenna: Ánin anta yulda, elye arcane sello, ar antanes lyen coirea nén.”
She said to him: “Lord, you have no water-vessel, and the well is deep. From where, then, do you have the living water?	Eques senna: “Heru, ual same calpa, ar i tampo ná núra. Mallo, tá, samil i coirea nén?
Surely you are not greater than Jacob our father, who gave us the well and who himself drank from it with his sons and his animals?”	Lau elye ná túra lá Yácov aterelma, ye antane men i tampo ar ye immo sunce sallo as yondoryar ar celvaryar?”
Jesus answered and said to her: “Everyone who drinks of this water shall be thirsty again.	Yésus hanquente ar eque senna: “Ilquen ye suce nén sino nauva soica ata.
Whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will by no means be thirsty, but the water that I will give him will be in him a spring of water that rises up into eternal life.”	Aiquen ye suce i neno ya inye antuva sen laume nauva soica, mal i nén ya inye antuva sen nauva sesse ehtele nenwa ya orta amba mir oira coivie.”
The woman said to him: “Lord, give me this water, that I will not be thirsty and will not be necessary for me to come here to draw water.”	I nís quente senna: “Heru, ánin anta nén sina, i lá nauvan soica ar lá mauyuva nin tule sinomenna calpien.”
He said to her: “Go, call your husband and come here!”	Eques senna: “Mena, yala verulya ar tula sir!”
The woman answered and said: “I do not have a husband.” Jesus said to her: “You spoke well: A husband I do not have.	I nís hanquente ar eque: “Uan same veru.” Eque senna Yésus: “Quentel mai: Veru uan same.
For you have had five husbands, and whom you have now is not your husband, Of this thing you spoke the truth.”	An asámiel veruvi lempe, ar ye samil sí ui lyenya veru. Pa nat sina quentel i nanwie.”
The woman said to him: “Lord, I see that you are a prophet.	I nís quente senna: “Heru, cenin i elye Erutercáno ná.
Our fathers worshipped on this mountain, but you say that Jerusalem is the proper place for worship.”	Atarilmar tyerner oron sinasse, mal lé quetir i Yerúsalem ná i vanima nóme tyerien.”
Jesus said to her: “Believe my word, woman: The hour is coming when you will not worship either on this mountain or in Jerusalem.	Eque senna Yésus: “Sava quetienya, nís: I lúme túla yasse ualde tyeruva i Atar var oron sinasse var Yerúsalemesse.
You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation comes from Jews.	Lé tyerir ya ualde ista; elme tyerir ya istalme, an rehtie tule Yúrallon.
But the hour is coming, and it is now, when the true worshippers will worship the father with spirit and with truth, for such worshippers the Father seeks.	Mal i lúme túla, ar eas sí, yasse i nanwe tyerindor tyeruvar i Atar fairenen ar nanwiénen, an taiti tyerindor i Atar cesta.
God is a spirit, and is necessary for who worship him to worship with spirit and with truth.”	Eru faire ná, ar mauya in se-tyerir tyere fairenen ar nanwiénen.”
The woman said to him: “I know that Messiah is coming, who is called Christ. Whenever he shall come, he will tell us everything.”	I nís quente senna: “Istan i túla Messías, ye ná estaina Hristo. Quiquie sé tuluva, nyaruvas men ilqua.”
Jesus said to her: “I who am speaking with you am he.”	Eque senna Yésus: “Inye ye quéta aselye ná sé.”
Now his disciples returned, and they were in wonder because he spoke with a woman; and yet nobody said: “What are you seeking?” or “For what reason are you speaking with her?” 	Sí hildoryar nanwenner, ar engelte elmendasse pan carampes as nís; ananta úquen quente: “Mana cesteal?” hya “Mana i casta yanen quétal óse?”
Thus the woman abandoned her water-vessel and went away into the city and said to the people:	Sie i nís hehtane calparya ar oante mir i osto ar quente i queninnar:
“Come here, see a man who has told me everything that I have done! Maybe he is the Christ?”	“Tula sir, cena nér ye anyárie nin ilqua ya acárien! Cé sé ná i Hristo?”
They went out of the city and came to him.	Lendelte et i ostollo ar túler senna.
At the same time the disciples urged him, saying: “Rabbi, eat.”	I imya lúmesse i hildor hortaner se, quétala: “Ravi, mata.”
But he said to them: “I have food to eat that you do not know.”	Mal sé quente téna: “Samin matso matien ya lé uar ista.”
Therefore the disiciples said, one to the other: “Did anybody bring him anything to eat?”	Etta i hildor quenter, quén i exenna: “Ma aiquen tulune senna aiqua matien?”
Jesus said to them: “My food is that I do the will of who sent me and complete his work.	Eque téna Yésus: “Matsonya ná i inye care i indóme yeo ni-mentane ar telya molierya.
Do you not say that are still four months before the harvest comes? Look! I say to you: Raise your eyes and behold the fields, that they are white for gathering the harvest. Even now	Ma ualde quete i ear en astar canta nó i yávie tule? Yé! Quetin lenna: Á orta henduldat ar á yéta i restar, i nalte ninqui comien i yávie. Yando sí
the sower is receiving his reward and is gathering produce for eternal life, that the reaper and the sower can have joy together.	i rerindo cáma paityalerya ar comyea yáve oira coivien, i polit i cerihtando ar i rerindo same alasse uo.
For here this proverb is true: One has sown and another is reaping.	An sís eques sina nanwa ná: Quén erérie ar exe cirihtea.
I sent you to reap which you have not worked . Others have worked, and you have come into their work.”	Inye mentane le cirihtien ya ualde omólie. Exeli omólier, ar lé utúlier mir molielta.”
And in that city many of the Samaritans believe in him by word of the woman who witnessed: “He told me everything that I did.”	Ar sana ostosse rimbali i Samárearon sáver sesse quettanen i nisso ye vettane: “Nyarnes nin ilqua ya carnen.”
Therefore, when the Samaritans came to him, they asked him to remain with them; and he remaied there for two days.	Etta, ire i Samárear túler senna, arcanelte sello lemie aselte; ar lemyanes tasse ré attasse.
And numerous ones believed by which he said,	Ar an rimbali sáver yanen quentes,
and they said to the woman: “We do not believe more because of what you said , for we have heard him ourselves, and we know that this man truly is the savior of the world.”	ar quentelte i nissenna: “Ualme ambe save lyenya quetiénen, an imme ahlárielmes, ar istalme i ná nér sina nanwave i rehtando i mardo.”
After the two days he went away from there to Galilee.	Apa i aure atta oantes talo Alileanna.
But Jesus himself witnessed that in his own place a prophet does not receive honor .	Mal Yésus immo vettane i véra nómeryasse Erutercáno ua same laitie.
Thus, when he came to Galilee, the people of Galilee received him, because they had seen the things that he did in Jerusalem at the festival, for they too went to the festival.	Sie, íre túles Alileanna, i queni Alileo camner se, pan anelte cénienwe ilye i nati yar carnes Yerúsalemesse i aşaresse, an yando té lender i aşarenna.
Thus he came again to Cana of Galilee, where he changed the water into wine. And was a king’s servant whose son was ill in Capernaum.	Sie túles ata Cánanna Alileo, yasse vistanes i nén mir limpe. Ar enge arandur yeo yondo náne hlaiwa Capernaumesse.
When this man heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee, he went to him and asked of him that he was to come down to heal his son, for he was near to death.	Íre nér sina hlasse i Yésus náne túlienwa et Yúreallo mir Alilea, lendes senna ar arcane sello i tulumnes undu nestien yondorya, an anes hare qualmenna.
But Jesus said to him: “If you do not see signs and wonders, you do not believe at all.”	Mal Yésus quente senna: “Qui ualde cene tannar ar elmendar, laume savilde.”
The king’s servant said to him: “Lord, come down before my boy dies.”	I arandur quente senna: “Heru, tula undu nó seldonya quale.”
Jesus said to him: “Go! Your son is alive.” The man believe the word that Jesus spoke to him and went away.	Eque senna Yésus: “Mena! Yondolya ná coirea.” I nér sáve i quetta ya Yésus quente senna ar oante.
But when he was still on the way his slaves met him to tell him that his son was alive.	Mal íre enges en i mallesse mólyar se-veldaner nyarien i yondorya náne coirea.
Therefore he inquired of them about the hour when he was better . And they said to him: “Yesterday, at the seventh hour, the fever left him.”	Etta cenşeset pa i lúme ya anes ambe alwa. Ar quentelte senna: “Noa, i otsea lúmesse, i úre váne sello.”
Thus the father knew that it happened in the same hour that Jesus said to him: “Your son is alive.” And he and his whole family believed.	Sie i atar sinte i martanes i imya lúmesse ya Yésus quente senna: “Yondolya ná coirea.” Ar sé ar quanda nosserya sáver.
That was the second sign that Jesus did, when he came out of Judea into Galilee.	Ta né i attea tanna ya Yésus carne, íre túles et Yúreallo mir Alilea.
After these things there wsa a festival of Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.	Apa nati sine enge aşar Yúraron, ar Yésus lende amba Yerúsalemenna.
In Jerusalem there is a pool called in Hebrew Bethsatha, having five columnades.	Yerúsalemesse ea ailin estaina Heveryasse Vetsáşa, arwa otarmiéron lempe.
In them a multitude was lying: sick ones, blind ones, paralyzed ones and withered ones, waiting for a stirring of the water.	Mi tai rimbe caine: hlaiwali, lombali, úlévimáli ar hessali, lartala coiren i nenwa.
For from time to time an angel of the Lord came down into the pool, causing a stirring of the water, and anyone who went first into the pool after the disturbance of the water was healed from every kind of illness that he had.	An lúllo lúnna Héru vala túle undu mir i ailin, tyárala coire i nenwa, ar aiquen ye lende minya mir i ailin apa i tarastie i nenwa náne nestaina ilya nostaleo hlíveva ya sámes.
But was a man there having had his illness for thirty-eight years.	Mal enge tasse nér sámienwa hlíverya loassen tolto nelequean.
Seeing this man lie there, and knowing that already he was ill for a long time, Jesus said to him: “Do you want good health?”	Cénala nér sina caitea tasse, ar istala i nollo anes hlaiwa anda lúmesse, Yésus quente senna: “Ma meril mále?”
The sick man answered him: “Lord, I do not have a man to put me in the pool when the water is disturbed, and when I am coming, another goes down before me.”	I hlaiwa nér hanquente senna: “Heru, uan same nér panien ni i ailinde íre i nén tarastaina ná, ar íre inye túla, exe lelya undu nó ni.”
Jesus said to him: “Rise, take up your bed and walk!”	Yésus quente senna: “Á orta, á mapa amba caimalya ar á vanta!”
And in the same moment the man received good health, and he lifted up his bed and began to walk.But that day was a day of rest.	Ar mí imya lú i nér camne mále, ar ortanes caimarya ar yestane vanta.Mal sana aure náne sendare.
Therefore the Jews said to the healed man: “This is a day of rest; carrying the bed is not allowed for you.”	Etta i Yúrar quenter i nestaina nerenna: “Si ná sendare; colie i caima ui lávina lyen.”
But he answered them: “ who gave me good health, he said to me: Take up your bed and walk.”	Mal hanquentes téna: “Ye nin-antane mále, sé quente ninna: Á mapa amba caimalya ar á vanta.”
They said to him: “Who is the man who said to you, Take it up and walk – ?”	Quentelte senna: “Man ná i nér ye quente lyenna, Ása mapa amba ar á vanta – ?”
But the healed man did not know who he was, for Jesus had gone away, since was a crowd in the place.	Mal i nestaina nér ua sinte man anes, an Yésus náne autienwa, pan enge şanga i nómesse.
After these things Jesus found him in the temple and said to him: “See, now you have good health. Do not sin more, that something worse will not happen to you.”	Apa nati sine Yésus se-hirne i cordasse ar quente senna: “Cena, sí samil mále. Áva úcare ambe, i ua martuva lyen ambe ulca nat.”
The man went away and told the Jews that Jesus was one who gave him good health.	I nér oante ar nyarne i Yúrain i náne Yésus ye antane sen mále.
And for this reason the Jews persecuted Jesus, because he did these things in the day of rest.	Ar sina castanen i Yúrar roitaner Yésus, pan carnes nati sine i sendaresse.
But he answered them: “My father works until now, and so I am working.”	Mal hanquentes téna: “Atarinya mole tenna sí, ar sie inye móla.”
For this reason the Jews wanted still more to kill him, for not only did he break the day of rest, but he also called God his own father, making himself like God.	Sina castanen i Yúrar merner en ambe nahta se, an lá rie rances i sendare, mal yando estanes Eru véra atarya, cárala immo ve Eru.
Therefore Jesus answered and said to them: “Truly, truly I say to you, the Son cannot do a single thing by himself, but only which he sees the Father doing. For anything which he does, that the Son also does in the same manner.	Etta Yésus hanquente ar eque téna: “Násie, násie quetin lenna, i Yondo ua pole care erya nat immonen, mal rie ya cenis i Atar cára. An aiqua ya sé care, ta i Yondo yando care i imya lénen.
For the Father loves the Son and shows him everything that he does, and he shall show him deeds greater than these, that you will be in wonder.	An i Atar mele i Yondo ar tana sen ilqua ya sé care, ar sen-tanuvas cardali túre lá sine, i nauvalde elmendasse.
For as the Father raises dead and makes them alive, so also the Son makes those he wants alive.	An tambe i Atar orta qualini ar care te coirie, sie yando i Yondo care i meris coirie.
For the Father does not judge anyone, but has given all judgement to the Son,	An i Atar ua name aiquen, mal ánies ilya namie i Yondon,
that all will praise the Son as they praise the Father. who does not praise the Son does not praise the Father who sent him.	i illi laituvar i Yondo ve laitalte i Atar. Ye ua laita i Yondo ua laita i Atar ye mentane se.
Truly, truly I say to you: who hears my word and believes in who sent me has eternal life, and he does not come to judgement, but has passed from death to life.	Násie, násie quetin lenna: Ye hlare quettanya ar save yesse ni-mentane same oira coivie, ar uas tule namienna, mal oantie ñurullo coivienna.
Truly, truly I say to you: The hour is coming, and it is now, when dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and who hear shall come to life.	Násie, násie quetin lenna: I lúme túla, ar eas sí, íre qualini hlaruvar i Eruiono óma, ar i hlarir tuluvar coivienna.
For as the Father has life in self, so he has given the Son to have life in self.	An tambe i Atar same coivie immosse, sie ánies i Yondon samie coivie immosse.
For he has given him authority of judgement, because he is Son of Man.	Ar ánies sen hére namiéva, pan Atanyondo náse.
Do not feel wonder about this, because the hour is coming when all that are in the tombs shall hear his voice	Áva fele elmenda pa si, pan i lúme túla yasse illi i ear i noirissen hlaruvar ómarya
and will come out, who did good things in a resurrection to life, but who did vile things in a resurrection of judgement.	ar ettuluvar, i carner máre nati enortiesse coivienna, mal i carner şaure nati enortiesse namiéno.
I do not do a single thng by self; as I hear I judge, and my judgement is just, for I do not seek my own will, but the will of who sent me.	Uan pole care erya nat immonen; ve hlarin namin, ar námienya faila ná, an uan cesta véra şelmanya, mal i şelma yeo mentane ni.
If I bear witness about self, my witness is not true.	Qui inye vetta pa immo, vettienya ui nanwa.
There is another who bears witness about me, and I know that his witness about me is true.	Ea exe ye vetta pa ni, ar istan i vettierya pa ni ná nanwa.
You sent some people to John, and he has witnessed about the truth.	Lé mentaner quelli Yohannenna, ar sé evettie pa i nanwie.
I do not receive man’s witness, but I say these things that maybe you will be saved.	Inye ua came atano vettie, mal quetin nati sine i cé nauvalde rehtaine.
That man was a burning and shining lamp, and for an hour you wanted to rejoice in his light.	Sana nér náne uryala ar caltala calma, ar ter lúme mernelte alasta calaryasse.
But I have the witness that is greater than John’s, for the deeds that the Father has given me to complete – the deeds that I am doing – those deeds bear witness about me that my Father sent me.	Mal inye same i vettie ya ná túra lá Yohanneo, an i cardar yar ánie nin Atarinya telien – i cardar yar inye cára – sane cardar vettar pa ni i Atarinya mentane ni.
Therefore, the Father who sent me, he has witnessed about me. You have not heard his voice or seen his shape,	Ente, i Atar ye ni-mentane, sé evettie pa ni. Ualde ahlárie ómarya hya ecénie cantarya,
and you do not have my word remaining in you. For that he sent, in him you do not believe.	ar ualde same quettarya lemyala lesse. An ye mentanes, sesse ualde save.
You search the scriptures, because you think that by them you will have eternal life, and they are that bear witness about me.	Ceşilde i tehteler, pan sanalde i tainen samuvalde oira coivie, ar tai nar yar vettar pa ní.
And yet you do not want to come to me, so that you will have life.	Ananta ualde mere tule ninna, i samuvalde coivie.
I do not want to receive glory from men,	Uan mere came alcar atanillon,
but I know about you that you do not have love for God in you.	mal istan pa lé i ualde same melme Eruva lesse.
I have come in my Father’s name, but you do not receive me. If another comes in his own name, you will receive him.	Inye utúlie i essenen Atarinyo, mal ualde came ni. Qui exe tule véra esseryanen, camuvalde sé.
How can you believe, when you receive glory from one another but do not seek the glory that comes from the only God?	Manen polilde save, íre camilde alcar quén i exello mal uar cesta i alcar ya tule i erya Ainollo?
Do not think that I will accuse you before the Father. who accuses you is Moses, in whom you have put your hope.	Áva sana i ulquetuvan le epe i Atar. Ye le-ulquete ná Móses, yesse apánielde estelelda.
For if you believed Moses’ saying you believed mine , for he wrote about me.	An qui sávelde Móseo quetie sávelde ninya, an sé tence pa ni.
But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe in my sayings?	Mal qui ualde save tecieryar, manen savuvalde ninye quetier?”
After these things Jesus went away crossing the Sea of Galilee, or Sea Tiberias.	Apa nati sine Yésus oante langala i Ear Alileo, hya Ear Tiverias.
But a huge crowd followed him, because they saw the signs that he did on the sick.	Mal haura şanga se-hilyane, pan cennelte i tannar yar carnes i hlaiwassen.
Then Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat down with his disciples.	Tá Yésus lende amba mir oron, ar tasse hamnes undu as hildoryar.
Now the Passover, the festival of Jews, was near.	Sí i Lahtie, i aşar Yúraron, náne hare.
When Jesus raised his eyes and saw a great crowd come to him, he said to Philip: “Where will we buy breads so that these may eat?” But this he said to test him, for he knew what he was going to do.	Íre Yésus ortane henyat ar cenne haura şanga túla senna, quentes Filipenna: “Masse hómancuvalve massali i sine lertuvar mate?” Mal si quentes tyastien se, an sé sinte ya carumnes.
Philip answered him: “Two hundred denarii are not enough for breads sufficing for them, that each person will receive a small piece.”	Filip hanquente senna: “Lenári tuxa atta uar fárie massain faryala tien, i ilya quén camuva pitya mitta.”
One of the dciples, Andrew the brother of Simon Peter, said to him: “ is here a small boy having five breads of barley and two fishes. But what are they for so many people?”	Quén i hildoron, Andréas i háno Símon Pétero, quente senna: “Ea sís pitya seldo arwa massaron findoriva lempe ar hala atto. Mal mana tai ta rimbe quenin?”
Jesus said: “Make the men sit down.” was much grass in the place. Therefore the men sat down, a number around five thousand.	Eque Yésus: “Á tyare i atani hame undu.” Enge olya salque i nómesse. Etta i atani hamner undu, nóte os húmi lempe.
Then Jesus took the breads, and after giving thanks, he distributed them to the sitting people, and so also the fishes, all that they wanted.	Tá Yésus nampe i massar ar, apa antie hantale, etsanteset i hámala queninnar, ar sie yando i halar, ilya ya mernelte.
But after they were filled he said to his disciples: “Gather the leftover pieces, that nothing will be lost.”	Mal apa anelte quátine eques hildoryannar: “Á comya i hehtaine mittar, i munta nauva vanwa.”
Therefore they gathered them, and they filled twelwe baskets with pieces of the five breads of barley – the leftovers left over by the people having eaten.	Etta comyaneltet, ar quantelte vircolcar yunque mittalínen i massaron findoriva lempe – i lembar hehtaine lo i mátienwe queni.
Thus, when the men saw the signs that he did, they said: “This man truly is the prophet who was to come into the world.”	Sie, íre i atani cenner i tannar yar carnes, quentelte: “Nér sina nanwave ná i Erutercáno ye tulumne mir i mar.”
Therefore Jesus, knowing that now they were going to come and take him to make him king, went away into the mountain, he alone.	Etta Yésus, istala i sí tulumnelte ar mapumneltes carien se aran, oante mir i oron, sé erinqua.
When evening came, his disciples went down to the sea,	Íre şinye túle, hildoryar lender undu i earenna,
and after going into a boat they were going over sea to Capernaum. But now it was dark , and Jesus still had not come to them.	ar apa menie mir lunte anelte lelyala olla ear Capernaumenna. Mal sí enge mornie, ar Yésus ena úme túlienwa téna.
Furthermore, the sea rose up, because a strong wind was blowing.	Ente, i ear amoronte, pan polda súre náne hlápula.
But when they had sailed around twenty-five or thirty furlongs, they saw Jesus walk on the sea and come near to the boat, and they were afraid.	Mal íre anelte círienwe os restandier lempe yúquean hya nelequean, cennelte Yésus vantea i earesse ar túla hare i luntenna, ar runcelte.
But he said to them: “ is I; do not fear!”	Mal eques téna: “Inye ná; áva ruce!”
Therefore they were willing to receive him into the boat, and in the same moment the boat was by the land to which they tried to go.	Etta anelte mérala camitas mir i lunte, ar mí imya lú i lunte enge ara i nór yanna névelte lelya.
On the following day the crowd that stood on the other shore of the sea saw that was not there boat. They had seen that was not another boat except the one, and that Jesus did not go away in it with his disciples, but his disciples alone had gone away.	I hilyala auresse i şanga ya tarne i hyana fárasse i earo cenner i ua enge tasse lunte. Anelte cénienwe i ua enge hyana lunte hequa i er, ar i Yésus ua oante sánen as hildoryar, mal hildoryar erinque náner autienwe.
But boats from Tiberias came to the place in which they ate the bread after the Lord gave thanks.	Mal lunteli Tiveriasello túler i nómenna yasse mantelte i massa apa i Heru antane hantale.
Therefore, when the crowd saw that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they went into their boats and went to Capernaum to seek Jesus.	Etta, íre i şanga cenne i uar enge tasse var Yésus var hildoryar, mennelte mir lunteltar ar lender Capernaumenna cestien Yésus.
When they found him on the other side of the sea they asked him: “Rabbi, at what time did you come here? ”	Íre hirneltes han i ear maquentelte senna: “Ravi, mana i lú yasse túlel sir?”
Jesus answered them and said: “Truly, truly I say to you, you are seeking me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate of the breads and were filled .	Yésus hanquente téna ar eque: “Násie, násie quetin lenna, cestealden, lá pan cennelde tannali, mal pan mantelde i massaron ar náner quátine.
Work, not for the food that will pass away, but for the food that remains for eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you; for on him the Father, God, has set his seal.”	Mola, lá i matson ya autuva, mal i matson ya lemya oira coivien, ya i Atanyondo antuva len; an sesse i Atar, Eru, apánie lihtarya.”
Therefore they said to him: “What are we to do in order to do God’s work?”	Etta quentelte senna: “Mana caruvalme carien molierya Eru?”
Jesus answered and said to them: “This is God’s work, that you are to believe in whom he sent.”	Yésus hanquente ar eque téna: “Si molierya Eru ná, i savuvalde yesse sé mentane.”
Therefore they said to him: “What, then, are you doing as a sign, that we will see it and we are going to believe in you? What are you doing?	Etta quentelte senna: “Mana, tá, cáral ve tanna, i cenuvalmes ar savuvalme lyesse? Mana cáral?
Our fathers ate the manna in the desert, as is written: He gave them bread from heaven to eat.”	Atarilmar manter i mán i erumasse, ve ná técina: Antanes tien massa menello matien.”
Therefore Jesus said to them: “Truly, truly I say to you: Moses did not give you the bread from heaven, but my Father indeed gives you the true bread from heaven.	Etta Yésus quente téna: “Násie, násie quetin lenna: Móses ua antane len i massa menello, mal Atarinya é anta len i nanwa massa menello.
For God’s bread is who comes down from heaven and gives light to the world.”	An Eruo massa ná ye tule undu menello ar anta cala i marden.”
Therefore they said to him: “Lord, always give us this bread!”	Etta quentelte senna: “Heru, illume ámen anta massa sina!”
Jesus said to them: “I am the bread of life. who comes to me will not ever be hungry, and who believes in me will not ever be thirsty.	Eque téna Yésus: “Inye ná i massa coiviéva. Ye tule ninna laume oi nauva maita, ar ye save nisse laume oi nauva soica.
But I have said to you: you have seen me, and yet you do not believe.	Mal equétien lenna: ecénielden, ananta ualde save.
Everyone whom the Father gives me will come to me, and who comes to me I will by no means throw out,	Ilquen ye i Atar nin-anta tuluva ninna, ar ye tule ninna laume hatuvan etsenna,
because I have come down from heaven to do, not my will, but the will of who sent me.	pan utúlien undu menello carien, lá ninya indóme, mal i indóme yeo mentane ni.
This is the will of who sent me, that nothing will be lost to me of all that he has given me, but I will raise it up again at the last day.”	Si ná i indóme yeo mentane ni, i munta nauva nin vanwa ilyo ya ánies nin, mal enortuvanyes i métima auresse.
Then the Jews murmured at him because he said: “I am the bread that came down from heaven.”	Tá i Yúrar nurruner senna pan quentes: “Inye ná i massa ya túle undu menello.”
And they said: “Is this man not Jesus son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How may he say: I have come down from heaven – ?”	Ar quentelte: “Ma nér sina ua Yésus Yosefion, yeo atar ar amil istalve? Manen lertas quete: Utúlien undu menello – ?”
Jesus answered and said to them: “Do not be murmuring among yourselves.	Yésus hanquente ar eque téna: “Áva na nurrula mici inde.
Nobody can come to me if the Father who sent me does not draw him, and I shall raise him up again at the last day.	Úquen pole tule ninna qui i Atar ye ni-mentane ua tuce se, ar inye enortuvanyes i métima auresse.
For is written in the Prophets: And all among them shall be taught by the Lord. Everybody who has heard from the Father and has learnt comes to me.	An ná técina mí Erutercánor: Ar illi mici te nauvar peantaine lo i Héru. Ilquen ye ahlárie i Atarello ar apárie tule ninna.
Not that anyone has seen the Father, except who is from God; he has seen the Father.	Lá i aiquen ecénie i Atar, hequa ye ná Erullo: sé ecénie i Atar.
Truly, truly I say to you: who believes has eternal life.	Násie, násie quetin lenna: Ye save same oira coivie.
I am the bread of life.	Inye ná i massa coiviéva.
Your fathers ate the manna in the desert, and yet they died.	Atarildar manter i mán i erumesse, ananta quallelte.
This is the bread that comes down from heaven, that anyone can eat of it and not die.	Si ná i massa ya tule undu menello, i aiquen pole mate sallo ar ua quale.
I am the living bread that comes down from heaven; if anybody eats of this bread he will be alive forever. And the bread that I will give is my flesh for the life of the world.”	Inye ná i coirea massa ya tule undu menello; qui aiquen mate sina masso nauvas coirea tennoio. Ar i massa ya inye antuva ná hrávenya i mardo coivien.”
Therefore the Jews quarreled one with the other, saying: “How can this man give us his flesh to eat?”	Etta i Yúrar costaner quén as i exe, quétala: “Manen nér sina pole anta ven hráverya matien?”
Thus Jesus said to them: “Truly, truly I say to you, if you do not eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you do not have life in yourselves.	Sie Yésus quente téna: “Násie, násie quetin lenna, qui ualde mate i Atanyondo hráve ar suce sercerya, ualde same coivie indesse.
He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up again at the last day.	Ye mate hrávenya ar suce sercenya same oira coivie, ar enortuvanyes i métima auresse.
For my flesh is real food, and my blood is a real drink.	An ninya hráve ná nanwa matso, ar ninya serce ná nanwa yulda.
 who eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in him.	Ye mate hrávenya ar suce sercenya lemya nisse, ar ní sesse.
As the living Father sent me and I have life by the Father, so also who eats me will have life by me.	Tambe i coirea Atar ni-mentane ar samin coivie i Atarnen, sie yando ye mate ní samuva coivie inyenen.
This is the bread that came down from heaven, not like that which your fathers ate and yet died. who eats this bread will be alive forever.”	Si ná i massa ya túle undu menello, lá ve ta ya atarildar manter ananta qualler. Ye mate massa sina nauva coirea tennoio.”
These things he said when he was teaching in a synagoge in Capernaum.	Nati sine quentes íre peantanes yomencoasse Capernaumesse.
Therefore numerous ones of his disciples, when they heard this, said: “This saying is hard; who can listen to it?”	Etta rimbali hildoryaron, íre hlasselte si, quenter: “Quetie sina hranga ná; man pole lasta sanna?”
But Jesus, knowing by himself that his disiciples murmured about this, said to them: “Does this cause you to fall?	Mal Yésus, istala immonen i hildoryar nurruner pa si, quente téna: “Ma si le-tyare lanta?
What, then, if you will see the Son of Man ascend to where he was before?	Mana, tá, qui cenuvalde i Atanyondo ortea yanna enges yá?
The spirit is what gives life; the flesh does nothing beneficial. The sayings that I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.	I faire ná ya anta coivie; i hráve care munta aşea. I quetier yar inye equétie lenna nar faire ar nar coivie.
But are among you some people who do not believe.” For from the beginning Jesus knew who did not believe and who was the one who was to betray him.	Mal ear mici le quelli i uar save.” An i yestallo Yésus sinte i uar sáve ar man né i quén ye vartumne se.
And he said: “For this reason I have said to you: Nobody can come to me if that is not given him by the Father.”	Ar eques: “Sina castanen equétien lenna: Úquen pole tule ninna qui ta ui antaina sen lo i Atar.”
Thereafter numerous ones of his disciples went away to the things behind them and did not want to walk with him more.	Epeta rimbali hildoryaron oanter i natinnar ca te ar uar merne vanta óse ambe.
Therefore Jesus said to the twelve: “Do you not want to go away, you too?”	Etta Yésus quente i yunquenna: “Ma ualde mere auta, yando lé?”
Simon Peter answered him: “Lord, to whom are we to go? You have sayings of eternal life,	Símon Péter hanquente senna: “Heru, ana man menuvalme? Elye same quetier oira coiviéva,
and we have believed and we know that you are the Holy One of God.”	ar asávielme ar istalme i elye ná Eruo Aire.”
Jesus answered them: “Have I not chosen you twelve? And among you one is a devil!”	Yésus hanquente téna: “Ma uan icílie lé yunque? Ar mici lé quén arauco ná!”
He talked about Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot. For this man, one of the twelve, was going to betray him.	Carampes pa Yúras, yondorya Símon Iscáriot. An nér sina, quén i yunqueo, vartumne se.
And after these things Jesus walked in Galilee, for he did not want to walk in Judea, since the Jews sought to kill him.	Ar apa nati sine Yésus vantane Alileasse, an uas merne vanta Yúreasse, pan i Yúrar cestaner nahta se.
But the festival of Jews, the Feast of Leaf-huts, was near.	Mal i aşar Yúraron, i Meren Lassemárion, náne hare.
Therefore his brothers said to him: “Go away from here and go into Judea, that also your disciples will see the deeds that you do!	Etta hánoryar quenter senna: “Á auta silo ar mena mir Yúrea, i yando hildotyar cenuvar i cardar yar caritye!
For nobody does anything secretly if he seeks to be known.	An úquen care aiqua nuldave qui cestas náve sinwa. Qui caritye nati sine, á apanta immo i marden!”
If you do these things, reveal yourself to the world!”	An hánoryar uar sáve sesse.
Therefore Jesus said to them: “My hour still has not come, but to you the hour is always ready.	Etta Yésus quente téna: “Lúmenya en ua utúlie, mal lén i lúme illume manwa ná.
The world cannot hate you, but it hates me, for I witnessed about it that its deeds are evil.	I mar ua pole yelta lé, mal yeltas ní, an vettan pa sa i cardaryar nar ulce.
You go up to the festival! I do not go up to this festival, for my hour still has not come.”	Alde lelya amba i aşarenna! Inye ua lelya amba aşar sinanna, an lúmenya en ua utúlie.”
After saying these things to them he remained in Galilee.	Apa quetie téna nati sine lemyanes Alileasse.
But after his brothers went to the festival, he too went up, not openly, but secretly.	Mal apa hánoryar lender i aşarenna, yando sé lende amba, lá pantave, mal nuldave.
Therefore the Jews sought him at the festival and said: “Where is that man?”	Etta i Yúrar cestaner se i aşaresse ar quenter: “Masse ná sana nér?”
And there was much murmuring about him among the crowds. Some people said: “He is a good man.” Others said: “He is not, but he causes the crowd to err!”	Ar enge olya nurrule pa sé imíca i şangar. Quelli quenter: “Náse mane nér.” Exeli quenter: “Uas, mal tyaris i şanga ranya!”
Of course , nobody talked openly about him, for they feared the Jews.	Ve hanyaina, úquen carampe pantave pa sé, an runcelte i Yúrallon.
When half of the festival had passed, Jesus went up into the temple and taught.	Íre perta i aşaro náne autienwa, Yésus lende amba mir i corda ar peantane.
Therefore the Jews were in wonder, saying: “How does this man know the Scriptures when he has not learnt lore?”	Etta i Yúrar enger elmendasse, quétala: “Manen nér sina ista i Tehteler íre uas apárie ñóle?”
Jesus therefore answered them and said: “What I teach is not mine, but is of who sent me.	Yésus etta hanquente téna ar eque: “Ya peantan ui ninya, mal ná yeva ni-mentane.
If anybody wants to do his will, he shall know concerning the teaching if it is from God or if I speak out of myself.	Qui aiquen mere care indómerya, istuvas pa i peantie qui nas Erullo hya qui quetin et immollo.
 who speaks out of himself is seeking his own glory; but who seeks the glory of the person who sent him, he is true, and there is no unrighteousness in him.	Ye quete et immollo cestea véra alcarerya; mal ye cesta i alcar i queno ye se-mentane, sé şanda ná, ar lá ea úfailie sesse.
Did not Moses give you the Law? But nobody among you does as the Law says. For what reason are you seeking to kill me?”	Ma Móses ua antane len i Şanye? Mal úquen mici le care ve i Şanye quete. Mana i casta yanen cestealde nahta ni?”
The crowd answered: “You are possessed by a demon! Who is seeking to kill you?”	I şanga hanquente: “Nalye haryaina lo rauco! Man cestea nahta lye?”
Jesus answered and said to them: “One deed I did, and you were all in wonder.	Yésus hanquente ar eque téna: “Erya carda carnen, ar lé enger illi elmendasse.
For this reason Moses gave you the circumcision – not that it is from Moses, but from the fathers – and you circumcise a man at a day of rest.	Sina castanen Móses antane len i oscirie – lá i nas Mósello, mal i atarillon – ar oscirilde atan sendaresse.
If a man receives circumcision on the day of rest, that the law of Moses is not to be broken, are you angry at me because I gave perfect health to a man on the day of rest?	Qui atan came oscirie i sendaresse, i Móseo şanye lá nauva rácina, ma nalde rúşie nin pan antanen ilvana mále atanen i sendaresse?
Do not judge as you see, but judge justly!”	Áva name ve cenilde, mal nama failie!”
Therefore some people from Jerusalem said: “Is not he the one that they are seeking to kill?	Etta quelli Yerúsalemello quenter: “Ma sé ui i quén ye cestealte nahta?
And look! he is speaking openly, and they say nothing to him. Surely the rulers have not really found that he is the Christ?	Ar yé! pantave quétas, ar quetilte munta senna. Lau i turcor nanwave ihírier i náse i Hristo?
But we know from where this man is. When Messiah shall come, nobody will know from where he is.”	Mal istalve yallo quén sina ná. Íre Messías tuluva, úquen istuva yallo náse.”
Therefore Jesus, when he taught in the temple, cried out and said: “Me you know, you know also from where I am. I have not come by myself, but who sent me is true, he whom you do not know.	Etta Yésus, íre peantanes i cordasse, etyáme ar quente: “Ní istalde, yando istalde yallo nanye. Lá utúlien immonen, mal ye ni-mentane şanda ná, sé ye lé uar ista.
I know him, for from him I come, and he sent me.”	Inye ista se, an sello tulin, ar sé mentane ni.”
Then they tried to seize him, but nobody laid his hand on him, for his time still had not come.	Tá névelte mapa se, mal úquen panyane márya sesse, an lúmerya en úme túlienwa.
But numerous ones of the crowd believed in him and said: “When the Christ shall come, surely he will not do deeds more numerous than that this man has done?”	Mal rimbali i şango sáver sesse ar quenter: “Íre i Hristo tuluva, lau caruvas cardar rimbe lá yar acárie nér sina?”
The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things about him, and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent some officers to seize him.	I Farisar hlasser i şanga nurrua nati sine pa se, ar i hére airimor ar i Farisar mentaner cánoli se-mapien.
Therefore Jesus said: “I will still be with you a short time, before I shall go away to who sent me.	Etta eque Yésus: “En euvan aselde şinta lúme, nó autuvan yenna ni-mentane.
You will seek me, but you will not find me, for where I am you cannot come.”	Cestuvalden, mal ualde hiruva ni, ar yanna ean lé uar poluva tule.”
Therefore the Jews said among themselves: “Where will this man go away to, that we will not find him? Surely he will not go away to who are scattered among the Greek, in order to teach the Greek?	Etta i Yúrar quenter mici inte: “Manna nér sina autuva, i elve uar hiruva se? Lau autuvas innar nar vintaine mici Hellenyar, peantien Hellenyar?
What does this saying mean that he said: You will seek me, but you will not find me, and where I am you cannot come – ?”	Mana tea quetie sina ya quentes: Cestuvalden, mal ualde hiruva ni, ar yanna ean lé uar poluva tule – ?”
But on the last day, the great day of the festival, Jesus stood up and cried out, saying: “If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me to drink!	Mal i métima auresse, i túra aure i aşaro, Yésus oronte ar etyáme, quétala: “Qui aiquen soica ná, lava sen tule ninna sucien!
 who believes in me, from his innermost part will flow streams of living water, as the Scripture has said.”	Ye save nisse, et ammitya rantaryallo ulyuvar celuméli coirea nenwa, ve i Tehtele equétie.”
But this he said about the spirit that were to receive who believed in him. For still there was no spirit, for Jesus still was not glorified.	Mal si quentes pa i faire ya camumner i sáver sesse. An ena lá enge faire, an Yésus en úme alcaryaina.
Therefore some of the crowd that heard these words said: “This person is indeed the Prophet.”	Etta quelli i şango i hlasser quettar sine quenter: “Quén sina é ná i Erutercáno.”
Others said: “This is the Christ.” But were who said: “Surely the Christ does not come from Galilee?	Exeli quenter: “Si ná i Hristo.” Mal enger i quenter: “Lau i Hristo tule Alileallo?
Does not the Scripture say that the Christ comes of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?”	Ma i Tehtele ua quete i tule i Hristo i erdo Laviro, ar Vet-Lehemello, i masto yasse enge Lavir?”
Therefore was a split concerning him in the crowd.	Etta enge şanca pa se i şangasse.
But some people among them wanted to seize him, but no one laid hands on him.	Mal quelli mici te merner mapatas, mal úquen panyane mát sesse.
Therefore the officers returned to the chief priests and to the Pharisees, and they said to them: “How you are not bringing him with you?”	Etta i cánor nanwenner i hére airimonnar ar Farisannar, ar té quenter téna: “Manen ualde túlua se aselde?”
The officers said: “No man has ever spoken like this.”	I cánor hanquenter: “Atan ua oi acarpie sie.”
The Pharisees therefore answered: “Sure you are not misled as well?	I Farisar etta hanquenter: “Lau yando lé nar útulyaine?
Has anyone among the rulers or Pharisees believed in him?	Ma aiquen imíca i turcor hya Farisar asávie sesse?
But this crowd that does not know the Law, they are accursed!”	Mal şanga sina ya ua ista i Şanye, té nar húne!”
Nicodemus, one among them who had come to him formerly, said to them:	Nicorémus, quén imíca te ye náne túlienwa senna yá, quente téna:
“Surely our Law does not judge a man unless one has first given him a hearing and knows what he has done?”	“Lau Şanyelva name nér qui mo ua minyave ánie sen hlarie ar ista ya acáries?”
They answered him: “Are you too from Galilee? Search and see that a prophet will not be raised up out of Galiliee.”	Hanquentelte senna: “Ma yando elye Alileallo ná? Ceşa ar cena i lá nauva Erutercáno ortaina et Alileallo.”
Then they went away, everyone to his house.	Tá oantelte, ilquen maryanna.
But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.	Mal Yésus lende Orontenna Milpioron.
At dawn he returned to the temple, and the whole people came to him, and he sat down and taught them.	Árasse nanwennes i cordanna, ar i quanda lie túle senna, ar hamnes undu ar peantane tien.
But the scribes and the Pharisees brought to him a woman seized in adultery. Placing her in their midst	Mal i ingolmor ar i Farisar tuluner senna nís mapaina úpuhtiesse. Panyala se endeltasse
they said to Jesus: “Teacher, this woman has been seized in the act of adultery.	quentelte Yésunna: “Peantar, nís sina anaie mapaina i cardasse úpuhtiéva.
In the Law Moses commanded that we are to stone such women. What, then, do you say?”	I Şanyesse Móses canne i saryuvalme taiti nissi. Mana, tá, elye quete?”
They said this to test him, that they were to have a thing by which they could accuse him. But he bent down and wrote on the ground with his finger.	Quentelte si tyastien se, i samumnes nat yanen ence tien ulquete se. Mal luhtanes undu ar tence i talamesse leperyanen.
When they asked him with persistence, he arose and said to them: “Let who is without sin throw at her the first stone!”	Íre maquentelte senna voronwiénen, orontes ar eque tien: “Lava yen ná pen úcare hate senna i minya sar!”
And again bending down be wrote on the ground.	Ar ata luhtala undu tences i talamesse.
But who heard this went away, one ofter one, the elders first, until he remained alone with the woman who stood in their midst.	Mal i hlasser si lender oa, quén apa quén, i amyárar minye, tenna lemyanes erinqua as i nís ye tarne endeltasse.
Jesus arose and said to her: “Woman, where are they? Did nobody judge you?”	Yésus oronte ar quente senna: “Nís, masse nalte? Ma úquen namne lye?”
She said: “Nobody, lord.” Jesus said: “Also I do not judge you. Go; from now do not sin more.”	Eques: “Úquen, heru.” Yésus quente: “Yando inye ua name lye. Mena; ho sí áva úcare ambe.”
Then Jesus talked to them again, saying: “I am the light of the world. who follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.”	Tá Yésus carampe téna ata, quétala: “Inye i mardo cala ná. Ye hilya ní ua vantuva morniesse, mal samuva i cala coiviéva.”
Thus the Pharisees said to him: “You witness about self; your witness is not true.”	Sie i Farisar quenter senna: “Vettal pa immo; vettielya ua nanwa.”
Jesus answered and said: “Even if I witness about self, my witness is true, since I know from whom I come and where I go away.	Yésus hanquente ar eque: “Yando qui vettan pa immo, vettienya nanwa ná, pan istan yallo tulin ar yanna autan.
You judge by the flesh; I do not judge anyboy at all.	Lé namir i hrávenen; inye laume name aiquen.
And yet, if I do judge, my judgement is true, since I am not alone, but the Father who sent me is with me.	Ananta, qui é namin, námienya nanwa ná, pan uan erinqua, mal i Atar ye ni-mentane ea óni.
Furthermore, in your own Law is written: The witness of two men is true.	Ente, véra Şanyeldasse ná técina: Atan atto vettie nanwa ná.
I am one who witnesses about self, and the Father who sent me witnesses about me.”	Inye ná quén ye vetta pa immo, ar i Atar ye ni-mentane vetta pa ni.”
Therefore they said to him: “Where is your Father?” Jesus answered: “You do not know either me or my Father. If you knew me, you knew also my Father.”	Etta quentelte senna: “Masse ea Atarelya?” Yésus hanquente: “Ualde ista var ni var Atarinya. Qui sintelde ní, sintelde yando Atarinya.”
These sayings he spoke in the treasury when he taught in the temple. But nobody seized him, since his time still had not come.	Quetier sine quentes i harwesse íre peantanes i cordasse. Mal úquen nampe se, pan lúmerya en úme túlienwa.
Thus he said to them again: “I go away, and you will seek me, and yet you will die in your sin. To where I go away you cannot come.	Sie quentes téna ata: “Autan, ar cestuvalden, ananta qualuvalde úcareldasse. Yanna inye auta lé uar pole tule.”
Therefore the Jews said: “Surely he will not kill himself? Because he says: To where I go you cannot come.”	Etta i Yúrar quenter: “Lau nahtuvas immo? Pan quetis: Yanna inye auta lé uar pole tule.”
But he said to them: “You are from the low ; I am from the high places. You are from this world; I am not from this world.	Mal quentes téna: “Lé nar i tumnallon; inye i tarmenillon ná. Lé nar mar sinallo; inye ui mar sinallo.
Therefore I said to you that you will die in your sins. For if you do not believe that I am he, you will die in your sins.”	Etta quenten lenna i qualuvalde úcareldassen. An qui ualde save i ní ná sé, qualuvalde úcareldassen.”
Therefore they said to him: “Who are you?” Jesus said to them: “ who I told you from the beginning.	Etta quentelte senna: “Man nálye?” Eque téna Yésus: “Ye nyarnen len i yestallo.
I have many things to say and to judge concerning you. But who sent me is true, and the things that I heard from him I am speaking in the world.”	Samin rimbe natali quetien ar namien pa lé. Mal ye ni-mentane şanda ná, ar i nati yar hlassen sello quétan i mardesse.”
They did not understand that he spoke to them about the Father.	Ualte hanyane i carampes téna pa i Atar.
Therefore Jesus said: “When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am he, and that I do nothing by myself , but as the Father taught me I speak these things.	Etta Yésus quente: “Íre ortanielde i Atanyondo, tá istuvalde i ní ná sé, ar i carin munta immonen, mal tambe i Atar peantane nin quetin nati sine.
And who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone, because I always do which is pleasing to him.”	Ar ye ni-mentane ea asinye; uas ehehtie ni erinqua, pan inye illume care ya ná sen mára.”
When he said these things, many believed in him.	Íre quentes nati sine, rimbali sáver sesse.
Therefore Jesus said to the Jews that believed in him: “If you remain in my word, you are truly my disciples,	Etta Yésus quente i Yúrannar i sáver sesse: “Qui lemyalde quettanyasse, nalde nanwave hildonyar,
and you shall know the truth, and the truth will free you.”	ar istuvalde i nanwie, ar i nanwie leryuva le.”
They answered him: “We are Abraham’s seed, and we have not ever been anybody’s slaves. How can you say: You shall be free – ?	Hanquentelte senna: “Nalme Avrahámo erde, ar ualme oi anaie aiqueno móli. Manen lertal quete: Nauvalde lére –?”
Jesus answered them: “Truly, truly I say to you: Everyone who does sin is the sin’s slave.	Yésus hanquente téna: “Nanwie, nanwie quetin lenna: Ilquen ye care úcare ná i úcareo mól.
Furthermore, the slave does not remain in the house forever; the son remains forever.	Ente, i mól ua lemya i coasse tennoio; i yondo lemya tennoio.
Therefore, if the Son frees you, you will indeed be free.	Etta, qui i Yondo le-lerya, é nauvalde lére.
I know that you are Abraham’s seed; but you are seeking to kill me, for my word does not find place among you.	Istan i lé nar Avrahámo erde; mal cestealde nahta ní, an quettanya ua hire nóme imíca le.
 that I have seen beside my Father I speak; and so you do that you have heard from your father.”	Yar ecénien ara Atarinya quetin; ar sie lé carir yar ahlárielde atareldallo.”
They answered him: “Our father is Abraham!” Jesus said to them: “If you are Abraham’s children, do Abraham’s deeds!	Hanquentes senna: “Atarelma Avraham ná!” Eque téna Yésus: “Qui nalde Avrahámo híni, cara Avrahámo cardar!
But now you are seeking to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham did not do so.	Mal sí cestealde nahta ní, atan ye anyárie len i nanwie ya hlassen Erullo. Avraham ua carne sie.
You do the deeds of your father.” They said to him: “We are not born by fornication; we have a single Father, God.”	Carilde i cardar atareldo.” Quentelte senna: “Umilme nóne úpuhtiénen; samilme erya Atar, Eru.”
Jesus answered them: “If God was your Father, you loved me, for from God I have come forth and I am here. Furthermore, I did not come by self, but he sent me.	Yésus hanquente téna: “Qui Eru náne Atarelda, mélelde ní, an Erullo etutúlien ar nanye sís. Ente, uan túle immonen, mal sé ni-mentane.
How do you not understand what I am saying? Because you cannot listen to my word.	Manen ualde hanya ya quétan? Pan ua ece len lasta quettanyanna.
You are of your father, the Devil, and you want to do your father’s desires. He was a manslayer from the beginning, and he did not stand firm in the truth, because truth is not in him. When he speaks the lie he speaks out of his own , because he is a liar and the father of the lie.	Nalde atareldo, i Arauco, ar merilde care atareldo íri. Sé náne atannahtar i yestallo, ar uas tarne tulca i nanwiesse, pan nanwie lá ea sesse. Íre quetis i huru quetis et véraryallon, pan náse hurindo ar i huruo atar.
But because I say to you the truth, you do not believe my word.	Mal pan inye quete lenna i nanwie, ualde save quetienya.
Who among you rebukes me about sin? If I speak truth, how you do not believe what I say?	Man mici lé naitya ní pa úcare? Qui quetin nanwie, manen ualde save ya quetin?
 who is from God listens to the sayings of God. Because of this you do not listen, for you are not from God.”	Ye ná Erullo lasta Eruo quetiennar. Sinen elde uar lasta, an ualde Erullo.”
The Jews said to him: “Do we not rightly say that you are a Samaritan and possessed by a demon?”	I Yúrar hanquenter senna: “Ma ualme quete vanimie i nalye Samárea ar haryaina lo rauco?”
Jesus answered: “I am not possessed by a demon, but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me.	Yésus hanquente: “Umin haryaina lo rauco, mal laitan Atarinya, ar lé úlaitar ní.
But I am not seeking glory for myself; there is One who is seeking and is judging.	Mal uan cestea alcar inyen; ea Quén ye cestea ar náma.
Truly, truly I say to you: If anyone keeps my word, he shall by no means ever see death.	Násie, násie quetin lenna: Qui aiquen himya quettanya, laume oi cenuvas qualme.”
The Jews said to him: “Now we know indeed that you are possessed by a demon. Abraham died, also the prophets, but you say: If anyone abides by my word, he shall by no means ever see death.	I Yúrar quenter senna: “Sí é istalme i nalye haryaina lo rauco. Avraham qualle, yando i Erutercánor, mal elye quete: Qui aiquen himya quettanya, laume oi cenuvas qualme.
Surely you are not greater than Abraham our father, who died? Also the prophets died. What do you make self?	Lau elye ná túra lá Avraham atarelma, ye qualle? Yando i Erutercánor qualler. Man carilye immo?”
Jesus answered: “If I will glorify myself, my glory is nothing. who glorifies me is my Father, who you say is your God,	Yésus hanquente: “Qui alcaryuvan immo, alcarinya munta ná. Ye ni-alcarya Atarinya ná, ye lé quetir ná Ainolda,
and yet you do not know him. But I know him. And if I said that I do not know him, I should be like you – a liar. But I know him, and his word I keep.	ananta ualde ista se. Mal inye ista se. Ar qui quenten i uan ista se, umnen ve lé – hurindo. Mal istanyes, ar quettarya himyan.
Abraham your father had great joy at the thought that he was to see my day, and he saw it and rejoiced.”	Avraham atarelda sáme túra alasse i sanwenen i cenumnes ninya aure, ar cenneses ar alastane.”
Therefore the Jews said to him: “You still do not have fifty years, and yet you have seen Abraham?”	Etta i Yúrar quenter senna: “Elye en ua same loar lepenquean, ananta ecéniel Avraham?”
Jesus said to them: “Truly, truly I say to you, before Abraham was, I am.”	Yésus quente téna: “Násie, násie quetin lenna, nó Avraham enge, inye ea.”
Therefore they picked up stones to throw them at him, but Jesus hid himself and went away from the temple.	Etta leptanelte sardeli hatien tai senna, mal Yésus nurtane immo ar oante i cordallo.
When he passed by, he saw a man blind from the womb.	Íre lahtanes, cennes nér lomba i mónallo.
And his disciples inquired of him: “Rabbi, who has sinned, this man or his parents, since he was born blind?”	Ar hildoryar cenşer se: “Ravi, man úacárie, nér sina hya nostaryat, pan anes nóna lomba?”
Jesus answered: “This man did not sin, or his parents, but this happened that God’s deeds were to be revealed by means of him.	Yésus hanquente: “Nér sina ua úcarne, hya nostaryat, mal si martane i umner Eruo cardar apantaine senen.
 is necessary for us to do the work of who sent me while is day; the night is coming when nobody can work.	Mauya ven care i molie yeo ni-mentane íre ea aure; i lóme túla yasse úquen pole mole.
While I am in the world, I am the world’s light.”	Íre ean i mardesse, nánye i mardo cala.”
After he said these things, he spat on the ground and made a mud with the spit, and he put the mud upon the man’s eyes	Apa quentes nati sine, piutanes i talamenna ar carne luxo i piutanen, ar panyanes i luxo i nero hendunna
and said to him: “Go, wash self in the pool called Siloam” – which means Sent. And so he went away and washed himself, and he returned seeing.	ar eque senna: “Mena, sova immo i ailinde estaina Siloam” – ya tea Mentaina. Ar sie oantes ar sóve immo, ar nanwennes cénala.
Therefore the neighbors and who formerly saw that he was a beggar said: “This man is who sat begging, no?”	Etta i armaror ar i yá cenner i anes iquindo quenter: “Nér sina ná ye hamne íquala, lá?”
Some people said: “It is he.” Others said: “No, but he is like him.” The man said: “I am he!”	quelli quenter: “Náse sé.” Exeli quenter: “Ui, mal náse ve sé.” I nér quente: “Inye ná sé!”
Therefore they said to him: “How, then, were your eyes opened?”	Etta quentelte senna: “Manen, tá, nét hendulyat latyaine?”
He answered: “The man called Jesus made a mud and put it on my eyes and said to me: Go to Sioam and wash yourself. Therefore I went and washed self, and then I could see.”	Hanquentes: “I nér estaina Yésus carne luxo ar sa-panyane hendunyatse ar quente ninna: Mena Siloamenna ar sova immo. Etta lenden ar sóve immo, ar tá polden cene.”
And they said to him: “Where is that man?” He said: “I do not know.”	Ar quentelte senna: “Masse ná sana nér?” Eques: “Uan ista.”
They brought the man who formerly was blind to the Pharisees.	Tulunelte i nér ye yá náne lomba i Farisannar.
But was a day of rest on the day that Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes.	Mal enge sendare i auresse ya Yésus carne i luxo ar latyane henyat.
So also the Pharisees asked him how he received sight. He said to them: “He put a mud on my eyes and I washed self, and I can see.”	Sie yando i Farisar cenşer se manen camnes céne. Eques téna: “Panyanes luxo hendunyatse ar sóven immo, ar polin cene.”
Therefore some of the Pharisees said: “This man is not from God, since he does not keep the day of rest.” Others said: “How can a man who is a sinner do such signs?” And was a split among them.	Etta quelli i Farisaron quenter: “Nér sina ui Erullo, pan uas hepe i sendare.” Exeli quenter: “Manen pole nér ye ná úcarindo care taiti tannali?” Ar enge şanca mici te.
Therefore they said to the blind man again: “What do you say about him, since he opened your eyes?” The man said: “He is a prophet.”	Etta quentelte i lomba nerenna ata: “Mana elye quete pa se, pan latyanes hendulyat?” I nér quente: “Náse Erutercáno.”
But the Jews did not believe concerning him that formerly he was blind and had received sight, until they called his parents of the man who received sight.	Mal i Yúrar uar sáve pa se i yá anes lomba ar náne cámienwa céne, tenna yaldelte i nostaru i nero ye camne céne.
And they asked them: “Is this person your son, who you say was born blind? How, then, he can see now?”	Ar cenşelte tú: “Ma quén sina ná yondosta, ye quetiste náne nóna lomba? Manen, tá, polis cene sí?”
Thus his parents answered: “We know that this is our son and that he was born blind.	Sie nostaryat hanquentet: “Istamme i si ná yondomma ar i anes nóna lomba.
But how he can see now we do not know, or who opened his eyes we do not know. Ask him! He is an adult man. He can speak for self.”	Mal manen sí polis cene uamme ista, hya man latyane henyat uamme ista. Ceşa se! Náse veaner. Polis quete immon.”
His parents said these things because they feared the Jews, for already the Jews had come to an agreement that if anyone confessed Jesus as Christ, he was to be excluded from the synagogue.	Nostaryat quentet nati sine pan runcette i Yúrallon, an nollo i Yúrar náner túlienwe essámalenna i qui aiquen etequentane Yésus ve Hristo, umnes hehtaina i yomencoallo.
Because of this his parents said: “He is an adult man; ask him.”	Sinen nostaryat quentet: “Náse veaner; ceşa se.”
Therefore they called for a second time the man who formerly was blind and said to him: “Give glory to God; we know that this man is a sinner.”	Etta yaldelte attea lússe i nér ye yá náne lomba ar quenter senna: “Á anta Erun alcar; istalme i ná nér sina úcarindo.”
But he answered: “If he is a sinner I do not know. One thing I know, that after being blind I now see.”	Mal sé hanquente: “Qui náse úcarindo uan ista. Er nat istan, i apa náve lomba sí cenin.”
Therefore they said to him: “What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?”	Etta quentelte senna: “Mana carnes lyen? Manen latyanes hendulyat?”
He said to them: “I told you already, and you did not listen. What is the reason that you want to hear it again? Do you too want to be his disciples?”	Hanquentes téna: “Nyarnen len nollo, ar ualde lastane. Mana i casta yanen merilde hlaritas ata? Ma yando lé merir náve hildoryar?”
And they abused him and said: “You are a disciple of that man, but we are disciples of Moses.	Ar naityaneltes ar quenter: “Elye ná hildo sana nero, mal elme nar hildoli Móseo.
We know that God has spoken to Moses, but of this man we do not know where he is from.”	Istalme i Eru acarpie Mósenna, mal pa nér sina ualme ista mallo náse.”
The man answered and said to them: “This is indeed a wonder, that you do not know where he is from, and yet he opened my eyes!	I nér hanquente ar eque téna: “Si é ná elmenda, i ualde ista mallo náse, ananta latyanes hendunyat!
We know that God does not listen to sinners, but if anybody fears God and does his will, he listens to him.	Istalve i Eru ua lasta úcarindonnar, mal qui aiquen ruce Erullo ar care indómerya, lastas senna.
From of old nobody has ever heard that anybody opened the eyes of one who was born blind.	Yalúmello úquen oi ahlárie i aiquen latyane hendu queno ye náne nóna lomba.
If this man was not from God, he could not do anything.”	Qui nér sina úne Erullo, uas polde care aiqua.”
They answered him: “You were wholly born in sins, and yet you teach us?” And they threw him out.	Hanquentelte senna: “Elye náne aqua nóna úcarelissen, ananta peantal men?” Ar hanteltes etsenna.
Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and after finding him he said: “Do you believe in the Son of Man?”	Yésus hlasse i anelte hátienwe se etsenna, ar apa hirie se quentes: “Ma elye save i Atanyondosse?”
The man answered: “And who is he, lord, that I can believe in him?”	I nér hanquente: “Ar man náse, heru, i polin save sesse?”
Jesus said to him: “You have seen him; indeed he is who is speaking with you.”	Eque senna Yésus: “Ecénielyes; é náse ye quéta aselye.”
Then he said: “I believe, Lord!” And he threw himself down before him.	Tá eques: “Savin, Heru!” Ar hantes immo undu epe se.
And Jesus said: “For judgement I came into this world, that the blind will be able to see, and that the seeing will be blind.”	Ar eque Yésus: “Namien túlen mir mar sina, i poluvar i lombar cene, ar i nauvar i cénalar lombe.”
Some of the Pharisees that were with him heard these things, and they said to him: “Surely we are not blind as well?”	Quelli i Farisaron i enger óse hlasser nati sine, ar quentelte senna: “Lau yando elme nar lombe?”
Jesus said to them: “If you were blind, you had no sin. But now you say: We see. Your sin remains.”	Eque téna Yésus: “Qui anelde lombe, pennelde úcare. Mal sí quetilde: Cenilme. Úcarelda lemya.”
“Truly, truly I say to you: who does not come in to the sheep through the door, but climbs up in another place, that person is a thief and a robber.	”Násie, násie quetin lenna: Ye ua tule minna i mámannar ter i fenna, mal rete amba hyana nómesse, sana quén ná arpo ar pilu.
But who comes in through the door is shepherd of the sheep.	Mal ye tule minna ter i fenna ná mavar i mámaron.
To him the door-watcher opens, and the sheep listen to his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them outside.	Sen i fennatir latya, ar i mámar lastar ómaryanna, ar yalis vére mámaryar essenen ar te-tulya etsenna.
When he has led his own outside, he walks before them, and the sheep follow him, since they know his voice.	Íre utúlies véraryar etsenna, vantas epe te, ar i mámar hilyar se, pan istalte ómarya.
A strange person they do not follow, but they flee from him, since they do not know the voice of strangers.”	Ettelea quén laume hilyalte, mal uşuvalte sello, pan ualte ista i óma ettelearon.”
Jesus spoke this comparison to them, but they did not understand that he said to them.	Yésus quente sestie sina téna, mal ualte hanyane yar quentes téna.
Therefore Jesus said to them again: “Truly, truly I say to you: I am the door of the sheep.	Etta Yésus quente ata: “Násie, násie quetin lenna: Inye ná i fenna i mámaron.
All who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them.	Illi i túler nó ni nar arpor ar pilur, mal i mámar uar lastane téna.
I am the door; anyone who comes in through me will be saved, and he will go in and out and will find pasturage.	Inye ná i fenna; aiquen ye tule minna ter ní nauva rehtaina, ar menuvas minna ar etsenna ar hiruva nessele.
The thief does not come except to steal and to kill and to destroy. I have come that they will have life and they will have abundance.	I arpo ua tule hequa pilien ar nahtien ar nancarien. Inye utúlie i samuvalte coivie ar samuvalte úve.
I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd gives his life on behalf of the sheep.	Inye ná i mane mavar; i mane mavar anta coivierya rá i mámain.
The paid man, who is not a shepherd and of whom the sheep are not his own, sees the wolf come and flees – and the wolf seizes them and scatters them –	I paityana nér, ye ua mavar ar yeva i mámar uar véraryar, cene i ñarmo túla ar uşe – ar i ñarmo mapa te ar vinta te –
since he is a paid man and the sheep are not important to him.	pan náse paityana nér ar i mámar uar valdie sen.
I am the good shepherd, and I know my sheep and my sheep know me,	Inye ná i mane mavar, ar istan mámanyar ar mámanyar istar ní,
as the Father knows me and I know the Father, and I give my life on behalf of the sheep.	síve i Atar ista ni ar inye ista i Atar, ar antan coivienya rá i mámain.
I have also some other sheep, that are not among these sheep; them as well is necessary for me to lead, and they will listen to my voice, and they will be a single flock, a single shepherd.	Samin yando hyane mámali, i uar mici mámar sine; yando té mauya nin tulya, ar lastuvalte ómanyanna, ar nauvalte erya lámáre, erya mavar.
By this reason the Father loves me, since I give my life, that I can receive it again.	Sina castanen i Atar mele ni, pan antan coivienya, i encamuvanyes.
Nobody has taken it from me, but I give it by my own will. I have authority to give it, and I have authority to receive it again. The command about this I received from my Father.”	Úquen amápie sa nillo, mal antanyes véra nirmenen. Samin hére antien sa, ar samin hére encamien sa. I canwa pa si camnen Atarinyallo.”
Because of these words there was another split among the Jews.	Sine quettainen enge hyana şanca imíca i Yúrar.
Numerous ones among them said: “He is possessed by a demon and is out of his mind! For what reason do you listen to him?”	Rimbali mici te quenter: “Náse haryaina lo rauco ar ea sámaryo etsesse! Mana i casta yanen lastalde senna?”
Others said: “These are not the sayings of a demon-possessed man. Surely a demon cannot open the eyes of blind ?”	Exeli quenter: “Sine uar quetier raucoharyaina nero. Rauco lau pole latya i hendu lombaron?”
At that time there was the festival of renewal in Jerusalem. It was winter,	Lúme yanasse enge i aşar ceutiéva Yérusalemesse. Enge hríve,
and Jesus walked in the temple, in Solomon’s columnade.	ar Yésus vantane i cordasse, Solomondo otarmiesse.
Therefore the Jews surrounded him and said to him: “How long will you keep us in uncertainty? If you are the Christ, tell us openly!”	Etta i Yúrar peller se ar quenter senna: “Manen andave me-hepuval útanciesse? Qui elye ná i Hristo, ámen nyare pantie!”
Jesus answered them: “I told you, and yet you do not believe. The deeds that I am doing in my Father’s name, they witness about me.	Yésus hanquente téna: “Nyarnen len, ananta ualde save. I cardar yar inye cára Atarinyo essenen, tai vettar pa ni.
But you do not believe, since you are not of my sheep.	Mal lé uar save, pan umilde ninye mámaron.
My sheep listen to my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.	Ninye mámar lastar ómanyanna, ar istanyet, ar hilyalten.
And I give them eternal life, and they will by no means ever be destroyed, and nobody will snatch them out of my hand.	Ar antan tien oira coivie, ar laume oi nauvalte nancarne, ar úquen te-rapuva et mányallo.
My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all others, and nobody can snatch them out of the Father’s hand.	Atarinya, ye ánie te nin, ná túra lá ilye exi, ar úquen pole te-rapa et i Ataro mállo.
I and the Father are one.	Ní ar i Atar nát er.”
Again the Jews took up stones to stone him.	Ata i Yúrar ortaner sardeli sarien se.
Jesus answered them: “I showed you many good deeds from the Father. Concerning what of those deeds do you want to stone me?”	Yésus hanquente téna: “Tannen len rimbe máre cardali i Atarello. Pa mana tane cardaron merilde sarya ni?”
The Jews answered him: “We are stoning you, not concerning good deed, but concerning blasphemy, and since you who are a man makes self a god!”	I Yúrar hanquenter senna: “Saryealme lye, lá pa mára carda, mal pa naiquetie, ar pan elye ye ná atan care immo aino!”
Jesus answered them: “Is it not written in your Law: I said: You are gods – ?	Yésus hanquente téna: “Ma ua técina Şanyeldasse: Quenten: Nalde ainoli – ?
If he called gods the people to whom God’s word came – and the Scripture one cannot put away –	Qui estanes ainoli i queni innar Eruo quetta túle – ar i Tehtele mo ua pole aupanya –
do you say to me whom the Father hallowed and sent into the world: You blaspheme, since I said, I am God’s son – ?	ma quetilde ninna ye i Atar airitáne ar mentane mir i mar: Naiquétal, pan quenten: Nanye Eruion – ?”
If I do not do my Father’s deeds, do not believe what I say .	Qui uan care Atarinyo cardar, áva save quetienyar.
But if I am doing them, and you do not believe my sayings, believe the deeds, that you will know and you will understand that the Father is in me and I in the Father.”	Mal qui cáran tai, ar lé uar save quetienyar, sava i cardar, i istuvalde ar hanyuvalde i ea i Atar inyesse ar inye i Ataresse.”
Therefore they tried again to seize him, but he escaped out of their hands .	Etta névelte ata mapa se, mal úşes et máltalto.
And he went away again beyond Jordan to the place where John baptized in the beginning, and there he remained.	Ar oantes ata han Yordanna i nómenna yasse tumyane Yoháno i yestasse, ar tasse lemyanes.
And numerous came to him, and they said: “John did not do a single sign, but everything that John said about this man was true.”	Ar rimbali túler senna, ar quentelte: “Yoháno ua carne erya tanna, mal ilqua ya Yoháno quente pa nér sina nanwa né.”
And many believed in him there.	Ar rimbali sáver sesse tanome.
 was a man who was ill, Lazarus from Bethany, the village of Mary and Martha her sister.	Enge nér ye né hlaiwa, Lasarus Vetaniallo, i masto Mário yo Marşa néşaryo.
The Mary whose brother Lazarus was ill was the woman who anointed the Lord with fragrant oil and dried his feet with her hair.	I María yeo háno Lásarus náne hlaiwa né i nís ye livyane i Heru níşima millonen ar parahtane talyat findileryanen.
Therefore the sisters sent word to him, saying: “Lord, see! whom you love is ill.”	Etta i néşar mentaner quetta senna, quétala: “Heru, yé! ye melilye hlaiwa ná.”
But when Jeus heard it he said: “This illness is not for death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of Man will be glorified by it.”	Mal íre Yésus sa-hlasse quentes: “Hlíve sina ua qualmen, mal Eruo alcaren, i nauva i Atanyondo alcaryaina sanen.”
Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.	Yésus méle Marşa ar néşarya ar Lasarus.
But when he heard that he was ill, he remained for two days in the place where he was.	Mal íre hlasses i anes hlaiwa, lemyanes aure attasse i nómesse yasse enges.
Thereafter, after this, he said to the disciples: “Let us go into Judea again.”	Epeta, apa si, quentes i hildonnar: “Alve mene mir Yúrea ata.”
The disciples said to him: “Rabbi, a short time ago the Jews sought to stone you, and you are going there again?”	I hildor quenter senna: “Ravi, şintanéya i Yúrar cestaner sarya lye, ar ménal tar ata?”
Jesus answered: “ are twelve hours of a day, no? If anyone walks at day, he does not fall, since he sees the light of this world.	Yésus hanquente: “Ear lúmi yunque aureo, lá? Qui aiquen vanta auresse, uas talta, pan cenis i cala mar sino.
But if anyone walks at night, he falls, since the light is not in him.”	Mal qui aiquen vanta i lómisse, taltas, pan i cala lá ea sesse.”
He said these things, and then he said to them: “Lazarus our friend has lain down to rest, but I will go there to wake him up.”	Quentes nati sine, ar tá eques téna: “Lasarus meldolva acaitie undu serien, mal menuvan tar eccoitien se.”
Therefore the disciples said to him: “Lord, if he has lain down to rest, he will be well.”	Etta i hildor quenter senna: “Heru, qui acaitie undu serien, nauvas alwa.”
Jesus spoke about his death, but they thought that he spoke about resting in sleep.	Yésus carampe pa qualmerya, mal té sanner i carampes pa serie húmesse.
Therefore Jesus then said to them openly: “Lazarus has died;	Etta Yésus tá quente téna pantie: “Lásarus aquálie;
and for your good I am glad that I was not there, that you will believe. But let us go to him.”	ar márieldan nanye alassea i uan náne tanome, i savuvalde. Mal alve lelya senna.”
Therefore Thomas, who was called the Twin, said to the other disciples: “Let us go, we too, that we will die with him.”	Etta Tomas, ye né estaina i Onóno, quente i hyane hildonnar: “Alve lelya, yando elve, i qualuvalve óse.”
Thus Jesus, when he came, found that Lazarus had already been lying four days in the grave.	Sie Yésus, íre túles, hirne i Lasarus nollo náne caitienwa auressen canta i noirisse.
Bethany was near to Jerusalem, like one and a half league from it.	Vetania né hare Yerúsalemenna, ve er ar perta lár sallo.
Thus many of Jews were come to Martha and to Mary to comfort them about their brother.	Sie rimbali Yúraron náner túlienwe Marşa yo Maríanna tiutien tú pa hánotta.
Therefore Martha, when she heard that Jesus came, met him; but Mary remained in the house.	Etta Marşa, íre hlasses i túle Yésus, velde se; mal María lemyane i coasse.
Thus Martha said to Jesus: “Lord, if you were here, my brother was not dead.	Sie Marşa quente Yésunna: “Heru, qui anel sís, hánonya úne qualina.
And yet I know that everything that you make petition about from God, God will give you.”	Ananta istan i ilqua ya arcal Erullo, Eru antuva lyen.”
Jesus said to her: “Your brother will rise.”	Eque senna Yésus: “Hánolya ortuva.”
Martha said to him: “I know that he will rise in the resurrection on the last day.”	Marşa quente senna: “Istan i ortuvas i enortalesse i métima auresse.”
Jesus said to her: “I the resurrection and the life. who believes in me, though if he dies, shall come to life,	Eque senna Yésus: “Inye i enortale ar i coivie. Ye save nisse, ómu qui qualis, tuluva coivienna,
and everyone who is alive and believes in me shall not ever die. Do you believe this?”	ar ilquen ye ná coirea ar save nisse laume oi qualuva. Ma savil si?”
She said to him: “Yes, Lord, I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God who was to come into the world.”	Eques senna: “Ná, Heru, savin i elye ná i Hristo, i Eruion ye tulumne mir i mar.”
And after saying this she went away and called Mary her sister, saying secretly: “The Teacher is here, and he is calling you.”	Ar apa quetie si lendes oa ar yalde María néşarya, quétala nuldave: “I Peantar ea sís, ar yálas tye.”
She, when she heard this, arose quickly and went to him.	Sé, íre hlasses si, oronte lintiénen ar lende senna.
Jesus still had not come into the village, but he was still in the place where Martha met him.	Yésus en ua túlelyane mir i masto, mal enges ena i nómesse yasse Marşa velde se.
When the Jews who were with Mary in the house to comfort her saw that she arose and went out, they therefore followed her, supposing that she was going to the grave to weep there.	Íre i Yúrar i enger as María mí coa tiutien se cenner i orontes ar etemenne, etta hilyaneltes, intyala i anes lelyala i noirinna nítien tasse.
And so Mary, when she came to the place where Jesus was and saw him, fell before his feet, saying to him: “Lord, if you were here my brother was not dead!”	Ar sie María, íre túles i nómenna yasse enge Yésus ar cenne se, lantane epe talyat, quétala senna: “Heru, qui anel sís hánonya úme qualin!”
Thus Jesus, when he saw that she cried, and that the Jews who were with her cried, groaned in his spirit and was shaken.	Sie Yésus, íre cennes i nítanes, ar i nítaner i Yúrar i enger óse, ñónane faireryasse ar náne pálina.
And he said: “Where have you put him?” They said to him: “Lord, come and see.”	Ar eques: “Masse apánieldes?” Quentelte senna: “Heru, tula ar cena.”
Jesus cried.	Yésus nítane.
Therefore the Jews said: “See how he loved him!”	Etta i Yúrar quenter: “Yé manen méleses!”
But some among them said: “Could not this man who opened the blind ’s eyes stop this man from dying?”	Mal quelli mici te quenter: “Ma nér sina ye latyane i lombo hendu ua polde pusta quén sina qualiello?”
Thus Jesus, after groaning again in self, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone lay before it.	Sie Yésus, apa ñonie ata immosse, túle i noirinna. Sá náne rotto, ar ondo caine epe sa.
Jesus said: “Take away the stone.” Martha, the sister of the dead, said to him: “Lord, now is a stench, for he has lain there for four days!”	Eque Yésus: “Á mapa oa i ondo!” Marşa, i qualino néşa, quente senna: “Heru, sí ea holme, an acaities tasse auressen canta!”
Jesus said to her: “Did I not say to you that if you believe, you will see God’s glory?”	Eque senna Yésus: “Ma uan quente lyenna i qui savil, cenuval Eruo alcar?”
Then they took away the stone. Jesus raised his eyes and said: “Father, I thank you because you have heard me.	Tá nampelte oa i ondo. Yésus ortane henyat ar quente: “Atar, hantan tyen pan ahlárietyen.
I know that you always hear me, but for the good of the crowd that is standing here I spoke, that they will believe that you sent me.”	Inye ista i illume hlarityen, mal i márien i şango ya tára sís carampen, i savuvalte i tyé mentane ni.”
And after saying this he cried out in a mighty voice: “Lazarus, come out!”	Ar apa quetie si etyámes taura ómanen: “Lasarus, ettula!”
And the man having died came out, restrained on his feet and on his hands by wraps, and having a cloth bound over his face. Jesus said to them: “Release him and let him go!”	Ar i quálienwa nér ettúle, hampa talyatse ar máryatse vaimalínen, ar arwa lanneo nútina or cendelerya. Eque téna Yésus: “Áse lerya ar lava sen lelya!”
Therefore many of the Jews who had come to Mary and saw what he did believed in him.	Etta rimbali i Yúraron i náner túlienwe Maríanna ar cenner ya carnes sáver sesse.
But some among them went to the Pharisees and told them the things that Jesus did.	Mal quelli mici te lender i Farisannar ar nyarner tien i nati yar carne Yésus.
Therefore the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered the Council and said: “What are we to do, since this man does many signs?	Etta i hére airimor ar i Farisar ócomner i Combe ar quenter: “Mana caruvalve, pan atan sina care rimbe tannali?
If we let him continue so, all will believe in him, and Romans will come and will take away both our holy place and our nation.”	Qui lavilve sen cacare sie, illi savuvar sesse, ar Rómear tuluvar ar mapuvar oa yúyo aire nómelva ar nórelva.”
But one among them, Caiaphas, who was the chief priest that year, said to them: “You do not know anything at all,	Mal quén mici te, Caiafas, ye náne i héra airimo loa yanasse, quente téna: “Laume istalde aiqua,
and you do not understand that it is beneficial for you that a single man is to die on behalf of the people, that the whole nation will not be undone.”	ar ualde hanya i ná len aşea i erya atan qualuva rá i lien, i lá nauva i quanda nóre nancarna.”
But that he did not say of self, but because he was the chief priest, he spoke as a prophet that Jesus was destined to die for the nation,	Mal ta uas quente immonen, mal pan anes i héra airimo, quentes ve Erutercáno i náne Yésus martyaina qualien i nóren,
and not solely for the nation, but that he would be able to gather into one the Children of God that are scattered.	ar lá rie i nóren, mal i polumnes comya mir er i Eruhíni i nar vintaine.
Therefore from that day they made plans to kill him.	Etta sana aurello carnelte panoli nahtien se.
Therefore Jesus did not more walk openly among Jews, but he went away from there to the land near to the desert, to a city called Ephraim, and there he remained with his disciples.	Etta Yésus ua ambe vantane pantie mici Yúrar, mal oantes talo i nórenna hare i erumenna, ostonna estaina Efraim, ar tasse lemyanes as hildoryar.
Now the Passover of Jews was near, and many came up out of the regions to purify themselves.	Sí i Lahtie Yúraron náne hare, ar rimbali lender amba et i ménallon poitien inte.
Therefore they sought Jesus and said, one to the other: “What do you think? That he will not come to the festival at all?”	Etta cestanelte Yésus ar quentelte, quén i exenna: “Mana sanalde? I laume tuluvas i aşarenna?”
The chief priests and the Pharisees had commanded that if anyone knew where he was, he was to tell, that they would be able to seize him.	I hére airimor ar i Farisar náner cánienwe i qui aiquen sinte yasse enges, nyarumnes, i polumnelte mapa se.
Thus Jesus, six days before the festival, came to Bethany, where was Lazarus whom Jesus had raised from dead.	Sie Yésus, auri enque nó i aşar, túle Vetanianna, yasse enge Lásarus ye Yésus náne ortienwa qualinillon.
Therefore they made for him an evening meal, and Mary served, but Lazarus was among those who lay by the table with him.	Etta carnelte sen şinyemat, ar Marşa veuyane, mal Lásarus enge imíca i cainer ara i sarno óse.
Then Mary took a pound of fragrant oil – genuine, most precious nard – and anointed Jesus’ feet and dried his feet with her hair. The scent of the fragrant oil filled the house.	Tá María nampe lungwe níşima millova – anwa, ammirwa alanarda – ar líve Yésuo talu ar parahtane talyat findileryanen. I ne i níşima millo quante i coa.
But Judas Iscariot, one among his disciples, who was going to betray him, said:	Mal Yúras Iscariot, quén mici hildoryar, ye vartumne se, quente:
“How this fragrant oil was not sold for three hundred denarii and the money given to the poor?”	“Manen níşima millo sina úne vácina lenári húmi nelden ar i tyelpe antaina i únain?”
He said this, not because poor were important to him, but because he was a thief: Having the moneybox he took that were put in it.	Quentes si, lá pan únar náner valdie sen, mal pan anes arpo: Sámala i tyelpecolca nampes yar náner panyaine sasse.
Therefore Jesus said: “Do not hinder her! Let her keep it for the day when I shall be brought to my grave.	Etta eque Yésus: “Áva hranga se! Lava sen hepitas i auren yasse nauvan talaina sapsanyanna.
For poor you always have with you, but me you do not always have.”	An únar illume samuvalde mici le, mal ní ualde illume same.”
When a huge crowd of Jews understood that he was there, they came, not solely because of Jesus, but also to see Lazarus, whom he raised from dead.	Íre haura şanga Yúralíva hanyaner i enges tasse, túlelte, lá rie Yésunen, mal yando cenien Lásarus, ye ortanes qualinillon.
But the chief priests made plans to kill Lazarus as well,	Mal i hére airimor carner panoli nahtien yando Lásarus,
since because of him many of Jews went there and believed in Jesus.	pan sénen rimbali Yúraron lender tanna ar sáver Yésusse.
On the following day, when the huge crowd that had come to the festival heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,	I hilyala auresse, íre i haura şanga ya náne túlienwa i aşarenna hlasse i Yésus né túlala Yerusalemenna,
they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him. And they cried: “Hosanna! Blessed is who comes in the name of the Lord, the king of Israel!”	nampelte olvali nindornelion ar etemenner omentien se. Ar yámelte: “Hosanna! Aistana ná ye tule i Héruo essenen, i aran Israélo!”
But after finding a young ass he sat down on it, as is written:	Mal apa hirie nessa pellope hamnes undu senna, ve ná técina:
“Do not fear, daughter of Zion! Look! Your king is coming, sitting on the colt of an ass.”	“Áva ruce, Síoniel! Yé! Aranelya túla, hámala pellopeo onnasse.”
The disciples did not understand these things from the beginning, but when Jesus was glorified , then they recalled how these things were written about him and that they did so to him.	I hildor uar hanyane nati sine i yestallo, mal íre Yésus náne alcaryaina, tá enyaldelte manen nati sine náner técine pa se ar i carnelte sie sen.
Thus witnessed, the people that were with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from dead.	Sie vettaner i queni i enger óse íre yaldes Lásarus et i noirillo ar se-ortane qualinillon.
Because of this the crowd, when they heard that he did this sign, also met him.	Sinen i şanga, pan hlasselte i carnes tanna sina, yando velde se.
Therefore the Pharisees said among themselves: “You see that you can do nothing. Look! The world has gone behind him.”	Etta i Farisar quenter mici inte: “Cenilde i polilde care munta. Yé! I mar elendie ca se.”
 were some Greeks among who went up to worship at the festival.	Enger Hellenyali mici i lender amba tyerien i aşaresse.
Therefore they came to Philip who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and they asked of him, saying: “Sir, we want to see Jesus.”	Etta túlelte Filipenna ye náne Vestairallo Alileo, ar arcanelte sello, quétala: “Hér, merilme cene Yésus.”
Philip came and told Andrew. Andrew and Philip came and told Jesus.	Filip túle ar nyarne Andréan. Andréas ar Filip túlet ar nyarnet Yésun.
But Jesus answered them, saying: “The hour has come when the Son of Man will be glorified.	Mal Yésus hanquente túna, quétala: “I lúme utúlie yasse i Atanyondo nauva alcaryaina.
Truly, truly I say to you: If a grain of seed does not fall into the ground and dies, it remains the single grain; but if it dies, then it bears much fruit.	Násie, násie quetin lenta: Qui ore erdeo ua lanta mir i talan ar quale, lemyas i erya ore; mal qui qualis, tá colis olya yáve.
 who loves his life will destroy it, but who hates his life in this world will protect it for eternal life.	Ye mele coivierya nancare sa, mal ye yelta coivierya mar sinasse varyuva sa oira coivien.
If anyone wants to serve me, let him follow me, and where I am, there my servant will be also.	Qui aiquen mere veuya ni, lava sen hilya ni, ar yasse inye ea, tasse yando núronya euva.
Now my soul is troubled, and what am I to say? Father, save me from this hour! But for this reason I have come to this hour.	Sí feanya tarastaina ná, ar mana quetuvan? Atar, áni rehta et lúme sinallo! Mal casta sinan utúlien lúme sinanna.
Father, glorify your name!” Therefore a voice came out of heaven: “I both glorified it and I shall glorify it again!”	Atar, á alcarya esselya!” Etta óma túle et menello: “Yúyo alcaryanenyes ar alcaryuvanyes ata!”
Therefore the crowd that stood there and heard it said that it was thunder. Others said: “An angel has spoken to him.”	Etta i şanga ya tarne tasse ar sa-hlasse quente i anes hundie. Exeli quenter: “Vala acarpie senna.”
Jesus answered and said: “This voice did not come for my good, but for yours.	Yésus hanquente ar eque: “Óma sina ua túle ninya márien, mal lenyan.
Now this world is judged, now the ruler of this world will be thrown out!	Sí mar sina ná námina, sí i túr mar sino nauva hátina etsenna!
And I, when I shall be lifted up out of earth, will draw all men to me.”	Ar inye, íre nauvan ortaina et cemello, tucuva ilye atani ninna.”
But that he said to show the kind of death that he was going to die.	Mal sá quentes tanien i nostale qualmeo ya qualumnes.
Therefore the crowd answered him: “We have heard from the Law that the Christ remains forever, and how may you say that is necessary for the Son of Man to be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?”	Etta i şanga hanquente senna: “Ahlárielme i Şanyello i termare i Hristo tennoio, ar manen lertal quete i mauya i Atanyondon náve ortaina? Man ná Atanyondo sina?”
Jesus therefore said to them: “The light will be among you for a short while more. Walk while you have the light, that darkness will not conquer you, for who walks in the dark does not know where he goes.	Yésus etta quente téna: “I cala euva mici le an şinta lúmesse. Á vanta íre samilde i cala, i ua mornie orturuva le, an ye vanta i morniesse ua ista yasse lelyas.
When you have the light, believe in the light, that you will be sons of light.”	Íre samilde i cala, sava i calasse, i nauvalde yondor calo.”
These things Jesus said, and he went away and hid himself from them.	Nati sine Yésus quente, ar oantes ar nurtane immo tello.
But though he had done so many signs in front of them, they did not believe in him,	Mal ómu anes cárienwa ta rimbe tannali opo te, ualte sáve sesse,
in order to fulfill the word that Isaiah the Prophet spoke: “Lord, who has believed what we have heard? And the arm of the Lord, to whom was it revealed?”	amaquatien i quetta ya quente Yesaia i Erutercáno: “Héru, man asávie ya ahlárielme? Ar i Héruo ranco, ana man anes apantaina?”
The reason why it was not possible for them to believe is that again Isaiah said:	I cesta yanen ua ence tien save ná i ata Yesaia quente:
“I will make their eyes blind and their heart hard, that they do not see with their eyes and understand with their hearts and turn , that I would heal them.”	“Acáries hendultat lombe ar endalta sarda, i ualte cene hendultanten ar hanya endaltanen ar quere inte, i nestumnenyet.”
Isaiah said these things because he saw his glory and spoke about him.	Yesaia quente nati sine pan cennes alcarerya ar carampe pa se.
And yet many also of the rulers believed in him, but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, that they that they were not going to be excluded from the synagogue.	Ananta rimbali yando i turcoron sáver sesse, mal Farisainen ualte etequentane se, i lá umnelte hehtaine i yomencoallo.
For they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God.	An mélelte i alcar atanillon ambe lá i alcar Erullo.
But Jesus cried out and said: “ who believes in me does not believe in me, but in who sent me,	Mal Yésus etyáme ar eque: “Ye save nisse ua save nisse, mal yesse ni-mentane,
and who see me sees also who sent me.	ar ye cene ní cene yando ye ni-mentane.
I have come as a light into the world, and everyone who believes in me shall not remain in the darkness.	Utúlien ve cala mir i mar, i ilquen ye save nisse ua lemyuva i morniesse.
But if anyone hears my sayings and does not heed them, I do not judge him, for I came, not to judge the world, but to save the world.	Mal qui aiquen hlare quetienyar ar ua cime tai, inye ua name se, an túlen, lá namien i mar, man rehtien i mar.
 who disregards me and does not keep my sayings has that judges him. The word that I have spoken is what shall judge him in the last day;	Ye úcime ní ar ua came quetienyar same ya name se. I quetta ya inye equétie ná ya namuva se i métima auresse;
since I have not spoken by myself, but the Father who sent me, he has given me command about what I will l say and I will speak.	pan inye ua equétie immonen, mal i Atar ye ni-mentane, sé ánies nin canwa pa ya quetuvan ar carpuvan.
And I know that his command is eternal life. Therefore, the things that I speak – as the Father has spoken them to me, so I speak.	Ar istan i canwarya oira coivie ná. Etta, i nati yar quetin – tambe i Atar equétie tai ninna, sie carpan.
Before the festival of the Passover, Jesus knew that now his time had come to pass away from this world to go to the Father, and after loving his own who were in the world, he loved them until the end.	Nó i aşar i Lahtiéno Yésus sinte i sí lúmerya né túlienwa autien mar sinallo menien i Atarenna, ar apa melie véryaryar i enger i mardesse, méleset tenna i metta.
They were eating the evening meal, and the Devil had already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot son of Simon that he was going to betray him.	Anelte mátala i şinyemat, ar i Arauco náne nollo pánienwa mir endarya Yúras Iscariot Símondion i se-vartumnes.
Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he came forth from God and was to go to God,	Yésus, istala i náne i Atar antienwa ilye nati máryanta, ar i ettúles Erullo ar menumne Erunna,
arose from the evening meal and put away his raiments. He took a linen cloth and girded himself. Thereafter he poured water into a bowl, and he started to wash the feet of the disiciples and to dry them with linen cloth with which he was girded.	oronte i şinyematello ar panyane oa larmaryar. Nampes paşelanne ar quiltane immo. Epeta ulyanes nén mir salpe, ar yestanes sove i hildoron talu ar parahta tú i paşelannenen yanen anes quiltaina.
Thus he came to Simon Peter. He said to him: “Lord, are you washing my feet?”	Sie túles Símon Péterenna. Quentes senna: “Heru, ma sóval talunyat?”
Jesus answered and said to him: “What I am doing you do not understand now, but you will understand it after these things.”	Yésus hanquente ar eque senna: “Ya cáran ual hanya sí, mal hanyuvalyes apa nati sine.”
Simon Peter said to him: “By no means will you ever wash my feet!” Jesus answered him: “If I do not wash you, you do not have part with me.”	Símon Péter quente senna: “Elye laume oi sovuva ninye talu!” Yésus hanquente senna: “Qui uan sove lye, ual same ranta asinye.”
Simon Peter said to him: “Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head!”	Símon Péter quente senna: “Heru, lá talunyat erye, mal yando mányat ar carinya!”
Jesus answered him: “ who has washed self does not have need that anything is to be washed except his feet, but is completely clean. And you are clean, but not all.”	Yésus quente senna: “Ye osóvie immo ua same maure i aiqua nauva sóvina hequa talyat, mal aqua poica ná. Ar lé nar poice, mal lá illi.”
For he knew the man betraying him. Therefore he said: “You are not all clean.”	An sintes i nér se-vartala. Etta quentes: “Umilde illi poice.”
After washing their feet and taking his robes he laid down again by the table and said to them: “Do you know what I have done to you?	Apa sovie talultat ar mapie larmaryar encaines undu ara i sarno ar quente téna: “Ma istalde ya acárien len?
You say to me: Teacher and Lord, and you speak well, for that I am.	Quetilde ninna, Peantar ar Heru, ar quetilde mai, an ta nanye.
Therefore, if I, the Lord and the Teacher, washed your feet, is also your duty that you wash one another’s feet.	Etta, qui inye, i Heru ar i Peantar, sóve taluldat, ná yando lenya rohta i sovilde quén i exeo talu.
For I have set for you an example , that as I have done, you too will do.	An apánien len emma, i ve inye acárie, yando lé caruvar.
Truly, truly I say to you: A servant is not greater than his lord, or a person sent than who sent him.	Násie, násie quetin lenna: Núro ua túra epe herurya, hya mentaina quén lá ye mentane se.
If you know these things, happy you are if you do them.	Qui istalde nati sine, alassie nalde qui carilde tai.
I do not speak of you all; I know that I have chosen. But it happens to fulfill the scripture: who ate my bread has turned his back on me.	Uan quete pa le illi; istan i icílien. Mal martas amaquatien i tehtele: Ye mante massanya equérie ponterya ninna.
From this moment I tell you before it happens; thus, when it shall happen, you will believe that I am he.	Lú sinallo nyarin len nó martas; sie, íre martuvas, savuvalde i ní ná sé.
Truly, truly I say to you: who receives anybody that I send receives me, and who receives me, receives who sent me.”	Násie, násie quetin lenna: Ye came aiquen ye inye menta came ní, ar ye came ní, came ye ni-mentane.”
After saying these things, Jesus was troubled in spirit, and he witnessed and said: “Truly, truly I say to you: One among you will betray me.”	Apa quetie nati sine, Yésus náne tarastaina fairesse, ar vettanes ar quente: “Násie, násie quetin lenna: Quén imíca le vartuva ni.”
The disciples looked on one another, not understanding about whom he spoke.	I hilmor yenter quén i exenna, lá hanyala pa man quentes.
Before Jesus’ bosom lay one of his disiciples, whom Jesus loved.	Epe Yésuo súma caine quén hildoryaron, ye Yésus méle.
Therefore Simon Peter gave a hint to that one and said to him: “Tell who is that he is talking about!”	Etta Símon Péter hiutane quén tananna ar eque senna: “Nyara man ná pa ye quétas!”
Thus the disciple, leaning towards Jesus’ chest, said to him: “Lord, who is he?”	Sie i hildo, talta Yésuo ambostenna, quente senna: “Heru, man náse?”
Therefore Jesus answered: “He is to whom I will give the piece of bread that I dip.” After dipping the piece he gave it to Judas the son of Simon Iscariot.	Etta Yésus hanquente: “Náse yen antuvan i ranta massava ya tumyan.” Apa tumie i ranta sa-antanes Yúras yondoryan Símon Iscáriot.
And after receiving the piece, then Satan went into him. Therefore Jesus said to him: “What you are doing, do it quickly!”	Ar apa camie i ranta, tá Satan lende minna se. Etta Yésus quente senna: “Ya cáral, ása care lintie!”
But nobody among who were lying by the table knew the reason why he said this to him.	Mal úquen imíca i cainer ara i sarno sinte i casta yanen quentes si senna.
And some thought, since Judas had the money box, that Jesus said to him: “Buy that we have need of for the festival,” or that he was to give something to the poor.	An quelli sanner, pan Yúras sáme i tyelpecolca, i Yésus quente senna: “Vaca yaiva samilve maure i aşaren,” hya i antumnes nat i únain.
Therefore, when he received the piece, he went out in the same moment. And was night.	Etta, íre camnes i ranta, etemennes mí imya lú. Ar enge lóme.
Thus, after he went out, Jesus said: “Now the Son of Man is glorified, and God is glorified by means of him.	Sie, apa etemennes, Yésus quente: “Sí i Atanyondo ná alcaryaina, ar Eru ná alcaryaina sénen.
If God is glorified by means of him, God himself will also glorify him, and he will glorify him soon.	Qui Eru ná alcaryaina sénen, Eru immo yando alcaryuva sé, ar se-alcaryuvas rato.
My children, I am with you for a little while more. You will seek me, and as I said to the Jews: Where I am going away you cannot come, so I say also to you now.	Hinyar, ean aselde an şinta lúmesse. Cestuvalden, ar tambe quenten i Yúrannar: Yanna inye auta lé uar pole tule, sie quetin yando lenna sí.
A new command I give you: to love one another. Just as I have loved you, so you too are to love one another.	Vinya axan antan len: melie quén i exe. Aqua ve inye emélie le, sie yando lé meluvar quén i exe.
By this all shall know that you are my disciples, if you have love among yourselves.”	Sinen illi istuvar i nalde hildonyar, qui samilde melme mici inde.”
Simon Peter said to him: “Lord, where are you going away to?” Jesus answered: “Where I am going away you cannot follow me now, but you will follow after.”	Símon Péter quente senna: “Heru, manna auteal?” Yésus hanquente: “Yanna autean ual pole hilya ni sí, mal hilyuval apa.”
Peter said to him: “Lord, how I cannot follow you now? I will give my life for you!”	Eque senna Péter: “Heru, manen uan pole hilya lye sí? Antuvan coivienya elyen!”
Jesus answered: “Will you give your life for me? Truly, truly I say to you: A cock will by no means sound before you have denied me thrice.”	Yésus hanquente: “Ma antuval coivielya inyen? Násie, násie quetin lyenna: Tocot laume lamyuva nó alálielyen nel.”
“Do not let your heart be troubled. Believe in God; believe also in me.	”Áva lave endaldan náve tarastaina. Sava Erusse; sava yando nisse.
In my Father’s house are many rooms. If not, I told you , since I am going away to prepare a place for you.	I coasse Atarinyava ear rimbe şambeli. Qui lá, nyarnen len, pan autean manwien nóme len.
Furthermore, if I go away and prepare a place for you, I shall return and receive you to myself, that where I am you too will be.	Ente, qui autan ar manwa nóme len, entuluvan ar le-camuva inyenna, i yasse inye ea yando lé euvar.
And where I am going away you know the way.”	Ar yanna autean istalde i tie.”
Thomas said to him: “Lord, we do not know where you are going away to. How do we know the way?”	Eque senna Tomas: “Heru, ualme ista yanna auteal. Manen istalme i tie?”
Jesus said to him: “I the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.	Yésus quente senna: “Inye i tie ar i nanwie ar i coivie. Úquen tule i Ataranna hequa ter ní.
If you knew me, you knew also my Father. From this moment you know him and you have seen him.”	Qui sintelden, sintelde yando Atarinya. Lú sinallo istaldes ar ecénieldes.”
Philip said to him: “Lord, show us the Father, and that is enough for us.”	Eque senna Filip: “Heru, ámen tana i Atar, ar ta farya men.”
Jesus said to him: “So long I have been with you , Philip, and yet you do not know me? who has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say: Show us the Father – ?	Yésus quente senna: “Ta andave engien aselde, Filip, ananta ual ista ni? Ye ecénie ní ecénie i Atar. Manen ece lyen quete: Ámen tana i Atar – ?
Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father in me? The things that I have spoken to you I have not spoken out of myself, but the Father who remains in me is doing his deeds.	Ma ual save i inye ea i Ataresse ar i Atar inyesse? I nati yar quetin lenna uan quete et inyello, mal i Atar ye lemya nisse cára cardaryar.
Believe me that I am in the Fatehr and the Father in me; if not, believe because of the deeds as such!	Á save i inye ea i Ataresse ar i Atar inyesse; qui lá, á save i cardainen ve taiti!
Truly, truly I say to you: who believes in me, he will do also the deeds that I do; and he will do deeds greater than they , since I am going away to the Father.	Násie, násie quetin lenna: Ye save nisse, sé caruva yando i cardar yar inye care; ar caruvas cardali túre lá tai, pan inye auta i Atarenna.
And anything that you pray for in my name, that I will do, that] the Father will be glorified by means of the Son.	Ar aiqua ya arcalde essenyanen, ta caruvan, i nauva i Atar alcaryaina i Yondonen.
If you pray for anything in my name, I will do it.	Qui arcalde aiqua essenyanen, caruvanyes.
If you love me, you will remain in my commandments,	Qui melilden, himyuvalde axaninyar,
and I will ask of the Father, and he will give you another helper that will be with you forever,	ar inye arcuva i Atarello, ar antuvas len hyana şámo ya euva aselde tennoio,
the Spirit of truth, that the world cannot receive, since it does not either see it or know it. You know it, since it remains in you and is in you.	i Faire nanwiéva, ya i mar ua pole came, pan uas var cene sa var ista sa. Lé istar sa, pan lemyas aselde ar ea lesse.
I do not leave you orphaned. I am coming to you.	Uan hehtuva le nostarence. Túlan lenna.
After a little while more the world will not see me more, but you will see me, since I am alive and you shall be alive.	Apa an şinta lúme i mar ua cenuva ni ambe, mal lé cenuvar ni, pan nanye coirea ar lé nauvar coirie.
On that day you will know that I am in my Father and you in me and I in you.	Enta auresse istuvalde i inye ea Atarinyasse ar lé nisse ar ní lesse.
 who has my commandments and abides by them, he is who loves me. Furthermore, who loves me shall be loved by my Father, and I will love him and will reveal self to him.”	Ye same axaninyar ar himya tai, sé ná ye mele ni. Ente, ye mele ní nauva mélina lo Atarinya, ar inye meluva se ar apantuva immo sen.”
Judas, not Iscariot, said to him: “Lord, what has happened, since you will reveal self to us and not to the world?”	Yúras, lá Iscáriot, quente senna: “Heru, mana amartie, pan apantuval immo men ar lá i marden?”
Jesus answered him and said: “If anyone loves me, he will abide by my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and will dwell with him.	Yésus hanquente ar eque: “Qui aiquen mele ni, himyuvas quettanya, ar Atarinya meluva se, ar tuluvamme senna ar maruvat óse.
 who does not love me does not abide by my words, and the word that you are hearing is not mine, but the Father’s who sent me.	Ye ua mele ni ua himya quettanyar, ar i quetta ya hláral ua ninya, mal i Ataro ye ni-mentane.
While I remain with you I have spoken these things to you.	Íre lemyan aselde equétien nati sine len.
But the helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father shall send in my name, he will teach you all things and will make you remember everything that I told you.	Mal i şámo, i Aire Fea, ye i Atar mentuva essenyanen, sé peantuva len ilye nati ar tyaruva le enyale ilqua ya nyarnen len.
Peace I let remain with you, my peace I give you. I do not give it as the world gives. Do not let your heart be troubled or frightened!	Raine tyarin lemya aselde, rainenya antan len. Uan anta sa ve i mar anta. Áva lave endaldan náve tarastaina hya ruhtaina!
You heard that I said to you that I am going away and I will return to you. If you loved me, you had joy because of my going to the Father, since the Father is greater than I.	Hlasselde i quenten lenna i autean ar nanwenuva lenna. Qui mélelden, sámelde alasse menienyanen i Atarenna, pan i Atar ná túra lá ni.
And now I have told you before it happens, that, when it does happen, you will believe.	Ar sí anyárien len nó martas, i, íre é martas, savuvalde.
I will not talk much with you from now , for the ruler of the world is coming. And he does not have power over me,	Uan carpuva ole aselde ho sí, an i mardo turco túla. Ar uas same túre or ni,
but that the world will know that I love the Father, therefore I am doing according to the command that the Father has given me. Rise, let us go from here!”	mal i istuva i mar i melin i Atar, etta cáran ve i canwa ya i Atar ánie nin. Á orta, alve lelya silo!”
“I the true vine, and my Father is the cultivator.	”Inye i nanwa liantasse, ar Atarinya i alamo ná.
Every branch in me not bearing fruit he takes away, and every that bears fruit he cleanses, that it will bear more fruit.	Ilya olva nisse lá cólala yáve mapas oa, ar ilya ya cole yáve poitas, i coluvas amba yáve.
You are already clean, by the word that I have spoken to you.	Lé nar nollo poice i quettanen ya equétien len.
Remain in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit if it does not remain in the vine, so you cannot , if you do not remain in me.	Á lemya nisse, ar inye lesse. Tambe i olva ua pole cole yáve qui uas lemya mí liantasse, sie lé uar pole, qui ualde lemya nisse.
I am the vine, you are the branches. who remains in me, and I in him, he bears much fruit; for away from me you can do nothing.	Inye ná i liantasse, lé nar i olvar. Ye lemya nisse, ar ní sesse, sé cole olya yáve; pan au nillo polilde care munta.
If anybody does not remain in me, he is thrown outside as a branch and is dried , and people gather those branches and throw them into the fire, and they are burnt.	Qui aiquen ua lemya nisse, náse hátina etsenna ve olva ar ná parahtaina, ar queni hostar tane olvar ar hatir tai mir i ruine, ar nalte urtaine.
If you remain in me and my sayings remain in you, pray for anything that you want, and it will happen for you.	Qui lemyalde nisse ar quetienyar lemyar lesse, á arca aiqua ya merilde, ar martuvas len.
My father is glorified by this, that you bear much fruit and show yourselves as my disciples.	Atarinya ná alcaryaina sinen, i colilde olya yáve ar tanar inde ve hildonyar.
As the Father has loved me and I have loved you, remain in my love!	Síve i Atar emélie ní ar inye emélie lé, á lemya melmenyasse!
If you abide by my commandments, you will remain in my love, as I have abided by the Father’s commandments and remain in his love.	Qui himyalde axaninyar, lemyuvalde melmenyasse, síve inye ihímie i Ataro axani ar lemya melmeryasse.
These things I have spoken to you, that my joy will be in you and your joy will be made full.	Nati sine equétien len, i alassenya euva lesse ar alasselda nauva carna quanta.
This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you.	Si axaninya ná, i melilde quén i exe ve emélien lé.
Nobody has a love greater than this, that a person gives his life for his friends.	Úquen same melme túra lá si, i quén anta coivierya meldoryain.
You are my friends if you do what I command you.	Lé nar meldonyar qui carilde ya canin len.
I do not more call you slaves, because a slave does not know what his lord does.	Uan ambe esta le móli, pan mól ua ista ya herurya care. Mal estanienye le meldor, an ilqua ya ahlárien Atarinyallo acárien sinwa len.
You did not choose me, but I chose you, and I have appointed you to go out and to bear fruit, and your fruit will remain, that the Father will give you what you pray for in my name.	Lé uar cille ní, mal inye cille lé, ar apánien le etemenien ar colien yáve, ar yávelda lemyuva, i len-antuva i Atar ya arcalde essenyanen.
These things I command you, that you will love one another.	Nati sine canin len, i meluvalde quén i exe.
If the world hates you, you know that it hated me before you.	Qui i mar yelta le, istalde i yeltanes ní nó le.
If you were a part of the world, the world loved its own. But because you are not a part of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, for this the world hates you.	Qui anelde ranta i mardo, i mar méle vérarya. Mal pan umilde ranta i mardo, mal inye icílie le et i mardello, sinen i mar yelta le.
Recall the word that I spoke to you: A slave is not greater than his lord. If they persecuted me, you too they will persecute. If they have abided by my word, they will abide by yours also.	Enyala i quetta ya quenten lenna: Mól ua túra lá herurya. Qui ní roitanelte, yando lé roituvalte. Qui ihímielte quettanya, himyuvalte yando lenya.
But they will do all these things to you because of my name, since they do not know who sent me.	Mal caruvalte ilye nati sine len essenyanen, pan ualte ista ye ni-mentane.
If I did not come and talked to them, they did not have sin; but now they do not have reason to give concerning their sin.	Qui uan túle ar carampe téna, ualte sáme úcare; mal sí ualte same casta antien pa úcarelta.
 who hates me hates also my Father.	Ye yelta ní yelta yando Atarinya.
If I had not done among them the deeds that nobody else has done, they did not have sin; but now they have seen and they have looked at both me and my Father.	Qui uan acárie mici te i cardar yar úquen hyana acárie, ualte sáme úcare; mal sí ecénielte ar eyétielte yúyo ní ar Atarinya.
But it happens in order to fulfill the word written in their Law: They hated me without reason.	Mal martas amaquatien i quetta técina Şanyeltasse: Yeltanelten ú casto.
When the Helper shall come whom I will send you from the Father, the Spirit of Truth, who comes forth from the Father, he will witness about me;	Íre i Şámo tuluva ye inye mentuva lenna i Atarello, i Faire nanwiéva, ye ettule i Atarello, sé vettuva pa ní;
you as well will witness, because you have been with me from the beginning.”	yando lé vettuvar, pan engielde asinye i yestallo.”
“These things I have spoken to you that you will not be made to fall.	”Nati sine equétien lenna i ualde nauva tyárine lanta.
People will exclude you from the synagogue. Indeed the hour is coming when everyone killing you will believe that so he serves God.	Queni le-hehtuvar et i yomencoallo. É i lúme túla yasse ilquen le-nahtala savuva i sie veuyas Eru.
But they will do these things since they do not know either the Father or me.	Mal caruvalte nati sine pan ualte ista var i Atar var ní.
But these things I have spoken to you that, when their time comes, you will recall that I told you about them. These things I did not say to you from the beginning, since I was with you.	Mal nati sine equétien lenna i, íre lúmelta tule, enyaluvalde i nyarnen len pa tai. Nati sine uan quente lenna i yestallo, pan engen aselde.
But now I am going away to who sent me, and yet nobody among you says to me: Where are you going away to?	Ono sí autean yenna ni-mentane, ananta úquen mici le maquete ninna: Manna auteal?
But since I have spoken these things, grief has filled your heart.	Mal pan equétien nati sine, nyére aquantie endalta.
But I am telling you the truth: It is beneficial for you that I am going away. For if I do not go away, the Helper will by no means come to you, but if I go away, I will send him to you.	Mal nyáran len i nanwie: Ná len aşea i autean. An qui uan auta, i Şámo laume tuluva lenna, mal qui autan, mentuvanyes lenna.
For when he shall come, he will make the world believe, concerning sin and concerning righteousness and concerning judgement:	Ar íre sé tuluva tyaruvas i mar save, pa úcare ar pa failie ar pa namie:
concerning sin, since they do not believe in me;	pa úcare, pan ualte save nisse,
concerning righteousness, since I am going away to the Father and they will not see me more,	pa failie, pan autean i Atarenna ar ualde cenuva ni ambe,
concerning judgement, because the ruler of this world has been judged.	pa namie, pan i turco mar sino anaie námina.
I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now.	En samin rimbe natali quetien lenna, mal ualde pole colitat sí.
But when he shall come, the Spirit of truth, he shall lead you into the whole truth, for he shall not speak out of self, but that he hears he will speak, and he will make known to you that will come.	Ono íre sé tuluva, i Faire nanwiéva, le-tulyuvas mir i quanda nanwie, an uas quetuva et immollo, mal yar hlaris quetuvas, ar caruvas sinwe len yar tuluvar.
He will glorify me, since he will receive out of my and will make them known to you.	Sé alcaryuva ni, pan camuvas et ninyallon ar caruvas tai sinwe len.
All the things that the Father has are mine. Because of that I said that he receives out of my and makes them known to you.	Ilye i nati yar i Atar same nar ninye. Tanen quentes i camis et ninyallon ar care tai sinwe len.
After a short time you will not see me more, and after another short time you will see me again.”	Apa şinta lúme ualde cenuva ni ambe, ar apa an şinta lúme encenuvalden.”
Therefore some of his disciples said, one to the other: “What does this mean that he said to us: After a short time you will not see me more, and after another short time you shall see me again, and: Because I am going away to the Father – ?”	Etta quelli hildoryaron quenter, quén i exenna: “Mana tea si ya quetis venna: Apa şinta lúme ualde cenuva ni ambe, ar apa an şinta lúme encenuvalden, ar: Pan autean i Atarenna – ?”
Thus they said: “What does this mean that he says: a short time? We do not understand what he is saying.”	Sie quentelte: “Mana tea si ya quetis: şinta lúme? Ualve hanya ya quétas.”
Jesus knew that they wanted to inquire of him, and he said to them: “Are you inquiring among yourselves about this, because I said: After a short time you will not see me, and after another short time you will see me again – ?	Yésus sinte i mernelte ceşitas, ar quentes téna: “Ma céşalde mici inde pa si, pan quenten: Apa şinta lúme ualde cenuva ni, ar apa an şinta lúme encenuvalden – ?
Truly, truly I say to you: You will weep and you will be wailing, but the world will rejoice; but your grief will be changed into joy.	Násie, násie quetin lenna: Nítuvalde ar nauvalde yaimie, mal i mar alastuva; mal nyérelda nauva vistaina mir alasse.
A woman, when she is bearing a baby, has grief, because her time has come; but when she has borne the child, she does not more recall her tribulation, because of her joy that a man has been born into the world.	Nís, íre cólas lapse, same nyére, pan lúmerya utúlie; mal íre ocólies i hína, uas ambe enyale şangierya, alasseryanen i anaie atan nóna mir i mar.
So you too have grief now. But I will see you again, and your heart shall have joy, and nobody will take your joy from you.	Sie yando lé samir nyére sí. Mal cenuvan le ata, ar endalda samuva alasse, ar úquen mapuva alasselda lello.
For in that day you will not ask me about anything. Truly, truly I say to you: Anything that you pray for from the Father in my name he will give to you.	Ar aure entasse ualde maquetuva ninna pa aiqua. Násie, násie quetin lenna: Aiqua ya arcalde i Atarello essenyanen antuvas len.
Until now you have not prayed for anything in my name. Pray and you shall receive, that your joy will be full.	Tenna sí ualde arcanie aiqua essenyanen. Á arca ar camuvalde, i alasselda nauva quanta.
These things I have spoken to you in comparisions. An hour is coming when I will no more speak to you in comparisons, but openly I will tell you about the Father.	Nati sine equétien lenna sestiessen. Lúme túla yasse uan ambe quetuva len sestiessen, mal pantave nyaruvan len pa i Atar.
In that time you will not ask anything in my name, and I do not say to you that I will ask of the Father concerning you .	Lúme entasse ualde arcuva aiqua essenyanen, ar uan quete len i inye arcuva i Atarello pa le.
For the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me and have believed that I came forth from God.	An i Atar immo mele le, pan lé emélier ní ar asávier i inye ettúle Erullo.
I have come forth from the Father and have come into the world. Furthermore, I go away from the world and go to the Father.	Etutúlien i Atarello ar utúlie mir i mar. Ente, autan i mardello ar mene i Atarenna.
His disciples said: “Look! Now you are speaking openly, and you do not speak comparison!	Hildoryar quenter: “Yé! Sí quétal pantie, ar ual quete sestie!
Now we know that you know all things and does not have need that anyone inquires of you. By this we know that you came forth from God.”	Sí istalme i istal ilye nati ar ua same maure i aiquen ceşuva lye. Sinen istalme i ettúlel Erullo.”
Jesus answered them: “Now you believe?	Yésus hanquente téna: “Sí savilde?
Look! The hour is coming, indeed it has come, when you shall be scattered everyone to his own house, and me you will leave alone, and yet I am not alone, since the Father is with me.	Yé! I lúme túla, é utúlies, yasse nauvalde vintaine ilquen véra coaryanna, ar ní hehtuvalde erinqua, ananta uan erinqua, pan i Atar ea óni.
I have spoken these things to you, that by me you will have peace. In this world you have tribulation, but have courage! I have conquered the world.”	Equétien nati sine lenna, i nínen samuvalde raine. Mar sinasse samilde şangie, mal sama verie! Inye orutúrie i mar.”
Jesus said these things, and raising his eyes to heaven he said: “Father, the hour has come; glorify your Son, that your Son will glorify you,	Yésus quente nati sine, ar ortala henyat menelenna eques: “Atar, i lúme utúlie; á alcarya Yondotya, i Yondotya alcaryuva tyé,
since you have given him lordship over all flesh, that he will give eternal life to all that you have given him.	pan ánietye sen hére or ilya hráve, i antuvas oira coivie illin i ánietye sen.
This is eternal life, that they know you, the sole true God, and whom you sent, Jesus Christ.	Si oira coivie ná, i istalte tyé, i erya nanwa Aino, ar ye mentanetye, Yésus Hristo.
I have glorified you on earth, completing the work that you have given me to do.	Tye-alcaryanien cemende, telyala i molie ya ánietye nin carien.
And now, Father, glorify me beside you with the glory that I had beside you before the world existed!	Ar sí, Atar, áni alcarya ara tyé i alcarnen ya sámen ara tyé nó i mar enge!
I have revealed your name to the men that you gave me out of the world. They were yours, and you gave them to me, and they have abided by your word.	Apantanien essetya i atanin i antanetye nin et i mardello. Anelte tyenye, ar antanetyet inyen, ar ihímielte quettatya.
Now they know that all things that you gave me are from you,	Sí istalte i ilye nati yar antanetye nin nar tyello,
for the sayings that you gave me I have given to them, and they have received them and indeed they know that you sent me.	an i quetier yar antanetye nin ánien tien, ar acámieltet ar é istalte i tyé mentane ni.
I make petition concerning them. I do not make petition concerning the world, but about that you have given me, since they are yours,	Arcan pa te. Uan arca pa i mar, mal pa i ánietye nin, pan nalte tyenye,
and all my things are yours and yours are mine, and I have been glorified among them.	ar ilye natinyar nar tyenye ar tyenyar nar ninye, ar anaien alcaryaina mici te.
Furthermore, I am not more in the world, but they are in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, protect them for your own name that you have given me, that they will be one, like us.	Ente, uan ea ambe i mardesse, mal té ear i mardesse, ar inye túla tyenna. Aire Atar, áte varya véra essetyan ya ánietye nin, i nauvalte er, ve vet.
When I was with them I protected them for your own name, and I have kept them, and none of them is destroyed except who was destined for destruction, to fulfill the scripture.	Íre engen aselte varyanenyet véra essetyan, ar ehépienyet, ar úquen mici te ná nancarna hequa ye náne martyaina nancarien, amaquatien i tehtele.
But now I am coming to you, and I say these things in the world that they will have full joy in themselves.	Mal sí túlan tyenna, ar quetin nati sine i mardesse i samuvalte quanta alassenya intesse.
I have given your word to them, but the world has hated them, since they are not a part of the world, as I am not a part of the world.	Ánien quettatya tien, mal i mar etévie te, pan umilte ranta i mardo, síve inye ua ranta i mardo.
I ask of you, not that you take them out of the world, but that you protect them from evil.	Arcan tyello, lá i mapatyet et i mardello, mal i varyatyet ulcullo.
They are not a part of the world, as I am not a part of the world.	Ualte ranta i mardo, síve inye ua ranta i mardo.
Sanctify them with truth; your word is truth.	Áte airita i nanwiénen; quettatya nanwie ná.
As you sent me into the world, I too sent them into the world.	Ve mentanetye ní mir i mar, yando inye mentane té mir i mar.
And I sanctify myself for them, that they will be sanctified with the truth.	Ar airitan immo tien, i nauvalte airinte i nanwiénen.
I pray, not concerning them alone, but also concerning those who believe in me by their word,	Arcan, lá pa té erinque, mal yando pa i savir nisse quettaltanen,
that they will all be one, as you, Father, is in me and I in you, that also they will be in us , that the world will believe that you sent me.	i nauvalte illi er, síve tyé, Atar, ea nisse ar inye tyesse, i yando té euvar vetse, i savuva i mar i tyé mentane ni.
Therefore, the glory that you have given me I have given them, that they will be one, as we are one,	Ente, i alcar ya ánietye nin ánien tien, i nauvalte er, síve vet nát er,
I in them and you in me, that they will be made perfect into one, that the world will know that you sent me and that you loved them, as you loved me.	ní tesse ar tyé nisse, i nauvalte cárine ilvane mir er, i istuva i mar i tyé mentane ni ar i méletyet, ve méletye ní.
Father, I wish that where I am, also that you have given me will be with me, that they will see my glory that you have given me, because you loved be before the world was established.	Atar, merin i yasse inye ea, yando i ánietye nin euvar asinye, i cenuvalte alcarinya ya ánietye nin, pan méletye ni nó i mar náne tulcaina.
Just Father, the world does not know you, but I know you, and these people know that you sent me.	Faila Atar, i mar ua ista tye, mal inye ista tye, ar queni sine istar i tyé mentane ni.
And I have made your name known to them and I will make it known again, that the love with which you loved me will be in them, and I in them.	Ar acárien essetya sinwa tien ar caruvanyes sinwa ata, i euva tesse i melme yanen méletye ní, ar inye tesse.
After saying these things, Jesus went out with his disciples across the brook called Kidron, to a place where was a garden, and he and his disciples went into it.	Apa quetie nati sine, Yésus etemenne as hildoryar olla i nelle estaina Cirron, nómenna yasse enge tarwa, ar sé ar hildoryar lender minna sa.
But also Judas, who betrayed him, knew the place, since Jesus at numerous times met with with his disciples there.	Mal yando Yúras, ye vartane se, sinte i nóme, pan Yésus rimbe lúlissen velde as hildoryar tasse.
Therefore Judas took the soldier host and officers of the chief priests and Pharisees and came there, bringing torches and lamps and weapons.	Etta Yúras nampe i ohtarhosta ar cánoli i hére airimoron ar Farisaron ar túle tanna, túlula narrundoli ar calmali ar carmali.
Thus Jesus, knowing all the things coming upon him, went forward and said to them: “What are you seeking?”	Sie Yésus, istala ilye i nati túlala senna, lende ompa ar quente téna: “Mana cestealde?”
They said: “Jesus from Nazareth.” He said to them: “I he.” Also Judas, who betrayed him, stood among them.	Hanquentes: “Yésus Nasaretello.” Eques téna: “Inye sé.” Yando Yúras, ye vartane se, tarne mici te.
But when he said to them: “I he,” they stood back and fell to the ground.	Mal íre quentes téna: “Inye sé”, nantarnelte ar lantaner i talamenna.
Therefore he answered them again: “Whom are you seeking?” They said: “Jesus from Nazareth.”	Etta hanquente téna ata: “Man cestealde?” Quentelte: “Yésus Nasaretello.”
Jesus answered: “I have said to you that I am he. Therefore, if me you are seeking, let them go away”	Yésus hanquente: “Equétien lenna i inye ná sé. Etta, qui ní cestealde, lava tien auta”
– in order to fulfill the word that he said: “Among that you gave to me none is lost to me.”	– amaquatien i quetta ya quentes: “Imíca i antanetye inyen úquen ná nin vanwa.”
Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it and struck the servant of the chief priest and cut off his right ear. The servant’s name was Malchus.	Tá Simon Péter, ye sáme macil, tunce sa ar pente i héra airimo núro ar aucirne forya hlarya. I núro esse né Malcus.
But Jesus said to Peter: “Put your sword in the sheath! The cup that the Father has given me, am I really not to drink it?”	Mal Yésus quente Péterenna: “Á panya macilelya i vainesse! I yulma ya i Atar ánie nin, lau sucuvanyes?”
Then the soldier host and the centurion and the officers of the Jews took Jesus and bound him.	Tá i ohtarhosta ar i tuxantur ar i cánor i Yúraron namper Yésus ar nunter se.
They brought him first to Annas, for he was the father of the wife of Caiaphas, who was the chief priest in that year.	Tulyaneltes minyave ana Annas, an sé náne i atar veriryo Caiafas, ye náne i héra airimo loa yanasse.
Caiaphas was who said to the Jews that it was beneficial for them that one man died on behalf of the people.	Caiafas né ye quente i Yúrannar i náne tien aşea i erya atan qualle rá i lien.
But Simon Peter and another disciple followed Jesus. That disciple was known to the chief priest and came with Jesus into the courtyard of the chief priest,	Mal Símon Péter ar hyana hildo hilyanet Yésus. Sana hildo náne sinwa i héra airimon ar túle as Yésus mir i paca i héra airimóva,
but Peter remained on the outside by the gate. Therefore the other disciple, who was known to the chief priest, came out and spoke to who watched the gate and led Peter inside.	mal Péter lemyane i etsesse ara i ando. Etta i hyana hildo, ye náne sinwa i héra airimon, ettúle ar carampe yenna tirne i ando ar tulyane Péter minna.
Then the maid who watched the gate said: “Are not you too of the disiples of that man?” He answered: “I am not.”	Tá i vende ye tirne i ando quente: “Ma ua yando elye i hildoron atan tano?” Sé hanquente: “Uan.”
The disciples and the officers had made a coal fire, for was cold, and they stood warming themselves. Also Peter stood with them warming himself.	I núror ar i cánor náner cárienwe hyulmaruine, an ringa né, ar tarnelte lautala inte. Yando Péter tarne aselte lautala immo.
Then the chief priest asked Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching.	Tá i héra airimo maquente Yésunna pa hildoryar ar pa peantierya.
Jesus answered him: “I have spoken to the world openly. Always I taught in synagogue and in the temple, where all Jews come together, and I said nothing in secret.	Yésus hanquente senna: “Acarpien i mardenna pantave. Illume peantanen yomencoasse ar i cordasse, yasse ilye Yúrar tulir uo, ar quenten munta nuldiesse.
For what reason are you inquiring of me? Inquire of who heard what I said to them. Look! They know what I said.”	Mana i casta yanen ní céşal? Ceşa i hlasser ya quenten téna. Yé! Té istar ya quenten.”
After he said these things, one of the officers that stood by him beat Jesus in the face and said: “Are you answering the chief priest so?”	Apa quentes nati sine, quén i cánoron i tarner ara se palpane Yésus i cendelesse ar eque: “Ma hanquétal i héra airimonna sie?”
Jesus answered him: “If I say what is bad, witness about the badness, but if I said what is right, what is the reason that you beat me?”	Yésus hanquente senna: “Qui quetin ya raica ná, á vetta pa i raicie, mal qui quenten ya ná vanima, mana i casta yanen palpal ni?”
Then Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the chief priest.	Tá Annas se-mentane nútina Caiafas i héra airimonna.
Now Simon Peter stood warming himself. Then he said to him: “Are not you too among his disciples?” He denied it and said: “I am not.”	Sí Símon Péter tarne lautala immo. Tá quentelte senna: “Ma ua yando elye mici hildoryar?” Sa-lalanes ar eques: “Uan.”
Among the slaves of the chief priest was one of the family of the man whose ear Peter cut off, and he said: “Did I not see you in the garden with him?”	Imíca i móli i héra airimo enge quén i nosseo i nero yeo hlas Péter aucirne, ar eques: “Ma uan cenne lyé i tarwasse óse?”
But Peter denied it again, and in the same moment a cock crowed .	Mal Péter lalane sa ata, ar mí imya lú tocot lamyane.
Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the palace of the governor. Now was early. But they did not go into the palace of the governor, in order not to be unclean, but they might eat the pascal meal.	Tá tulyanelte Yésus Caiafasello i túriondenna i nóreturwa. Sí arinya né. Mal té uar lende mir i túrion i nóreturwa, lá náven úpoice, mal lertumnelte mate i lahtiémat.
Then Pilate came outside to them and said: “What is the accusation that you are bringing against this man?”	Tá Piláto túle etsenna téna ar eque: “Mana i ulquetie ya túlualde nér sinanna?”
They answered him: “If this man was not a criminal, we did not turn him over to you.”	Hanquentelte senna: “Qui nér sina úme ongwemo, ualme arantane se lyenna.”
Then Pilate said to them: “You take him and judge him by your law.” The Jews said to him: “We may not kill anyone”	Tá eque téna Piláto: “Lé áse mapa ar áse name şanyeldanen.” I Yúrar quenter senna: “Ualme lerta nahta aiquen”
– in order to fulfill the word that Jesus spoke to indicate the kind of death that he was to die.	– amaquatien i quetta ya quente Yésus tanien i nostale qualmeo ya qualumnes.
Therefore Pilate went into the palace of the governor and called Jesus and said to him: “Are you the king of Jews?”	Etta Piláto lende mir i túrion i nóreturwa ar yalde Yésus ar quente senna: “Ma elye ná i aran Yúraron?”
Jesus answered: “Do you say this by yourself, or have others talked to you about me?”	Yésus hanquente: “Ma quetil si immonen, hya ma exeli acarpier lyenna pa ní?”
Pilate answered: “Surely I am not a Jew? Your own nation and the chief priests turned you over to me. What have you done?”	Piláto hanquente: “Lau inye Yúra ná? Véra nórelya ar i hére airimor arantaner lye inyen. Mana acáriel?”
Jesus answered: “My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom was of this world, my servants fought, that I would not be turned over to the Jews. But now my kingdom is not from here.”	Yésus hanquente: “Aranienya ua mar sino. Qui náne aranienya mar sino, núronyar mahtaner, i inye lá umne arantaina i Yúrain. Mal sí aranienya ui silo.”
Therefore Pilate said to him: “Thus you are a king?” Jesus answered: “You yourself are saying that I am a king. For this thing I have been born, and for this thing I have come into the world, that I was to witness about the truth. Everyone who is of the truth listens to my voice.”	Etta Piláto quente senna: “Sie nalye aran?” Yésus hanquente: “Elye quéta i nanye aran. Nat sinan anaien nóna, ar nat sinan utúlien mir i mar, i vettumnen pa i nanwie. Ilquen ye ná i nanwiéno lasta ómanyanna.”
Pilate said to him: “What is truth?”After saying this he went out again to the Jews and said to them: “I do not find guilt in him.	Eque senna Piláto: “Mana nanwie?”Apa quetie si etemennes ata i Yúrannar ar quente téna: “Uan hire cáma sesse.
But you have a custom that I release to you a man at the Passover. Do you wish, then, that I release to you the king of Jews?”	Mal samilde haime i senin len nér i Lahtiesse. Ma merilde, tá, i senuvan len i aran Yúraron?”
Then they cried again, saying: “Not this man, but Barabbas!” But Barabbas was a robber.	Tá yámelte ata, quétala: “Lá nér sina, mal Varavas!” Ono Varavas náne pilu.
Then Pilate therefore took Jesus and flogged him.	Tá Piláto etta nampe Yésus ar falpane se.
And the soldiers made a crown of some thorns and put it on his head and threw a purple raiment around him,	Ar i ohtari carner ríe necellíva ar sa-panyaner caryasse ar hanter luicarne larma os se,
and they came before him and said: “Hail, King of Jews.” And they beat him in the face.	ar túlelte epe se ar quenter: “Aiya, Aran Yúraron!” Ar palpaneltes i cendelesse.
And Pilate went outside again and said to them: “Look! I am bringing him out to you again, that you can know that I do not find guilt in him.”	Ar Piláto lende etsenna ata ar quente téna: “Cena! Túluanyes etsenna lenna ata, i istuvalde i uan hire cáma sesse.”
Therefore Jesus came out, bearing the crown of thorns and the purple raiment. And he said to them: “Behold the man!”	Etta Yésus ettúle, cólala i ríe neceliva ar i luicarne larma. Ar quentes téna: “Ela i atan!”
But when the chief priests and the officers saw him, they cried saying: “Crucify him! Crucify him!” Pilate said to them: “You take him and crucify him, for I do not find guilt in him.”	Mal íre i hére airimor ar i cánor cenner se, yámelte quétala: “Áse tarwesta! Áse tarwesta!” Piláto quente téna: “Lé áse mapa ar áse tarwesta, an inye ua hire cáma sesse.”
The Jews answered him: “We have a law, and by that law he is worthy of death, since he has made self God’s son.”	I Yúrar hanquenter senna: “Samilme şanye, ar sana şanyenen náse valda qualmeo, pan acárien immo Eruo yondo.”
Therefore, when Pilate heard this saying, he was more frightened,	Etta, íre Piláto hlasse quetie sina, anes ambe ruhtaina,
and he went into the palace again and said to Jesus: “Where do you come from?” But Jesus did not give him answer.	ar lendes mir i túrion ata ar eque Yésunna: “Mallo tulilye?” Mal Yésus ua antane sen hanquenta.
Therefore Pilate said to him: “Do you not talk to me? Do you not know that I have authority to release you and authority to crucify you?”	Etta Piláto quente senna: “Ma ual carpa ninna? Ma ual ista i inye same hére lye-senien ar hére lye-tarwestien?”
Jesus answered him: “You had no authority at all over me if it was not given you from on high. Because of this the man who turned me over to you has greater sin.”	Yésus hanquente senna: “Laume sámel hére or ní qui úmes antaina lyen táriello. Sinen i nér ye ni-arantane lyen same ambe túra úcare.”
Therefore Pilate sought a way of releasing him. But the Jews shouted, saying: “If you relase this man, you are not a friend of the High King ! Anyone who makes self a king rises up against the High King!”	Etta Piláto cestane lé senien se. Mal i Yúrar yámer, quétala: “Qui senil nér sina, umilye meldo i Táraráno! Ilquen ye care immo aran amorta i Táraranna!”
Therefore Pilate, after hearing these things, brought Jesus outside, and he sat down on his judge seat in a place called the Stone Court, or in Hebrew Gabbatha.	Etta Piláto, apa hlarie quettar sine, tulune Yésus etsenna, ar hamnes undu námohammasse nómesse estaina i Sarna Paca, hya Heveryasse Avaşa.
Now was the preparation of the Passover; was around the night hour. And he said to the Jews: “Behold your king!”	Sí enge i manwie i Lahtiéva; náne os i nertea lúme. Ar quentes i Yúrannar: “Ela aranelda!”
But they cried: “Take him away, take him away! Crucify him!” Pilate said to them: “Am I to crucify your king?” The chief priests answered: “We do not have king except the High King!”	Mal yámelte: “Áse mapa oa, áse mapa oa! Áse tarwesta!” Piláto quente téna: “Ma tarwestuvan aranelda?” I hére airimor hanquenter: “Ualme same aran enga i Táraran!”
Then, therefore, he turned Jesus over to them for crucifixion.So they took Jesus.	Tá, etta, arantanes Yésus tien tarwestien.Sie nampelte Yésus.
Carrying his cross for self he went out to the place called Skull Place, the Hebrew name of which is Golgotha.	Cólala tarwerya insen etemennes i nómenna estaina Caraxomen, yó Heverya esse ná Olyoşa.
There they crucified him, and two others with him, one on his right and one on his left, with Jesus in the middle.	Tasse tarwestaneltes, ar exe atta óse, quén foryaryasse ar quén hyaryaryasse, as Yésus i endesse.
Pilate wrote also a sign and put it on the cross. was written: “Jesus from Nazareth, King of Jews.”	Piláto tence yando tanwa ar panyane sa i tarwesse. Né técina: “Yésus Nasaretello, Aran Yúraron.”
Thus many of the Jews read this sign, since the place where Jesus was crucified lay near to the city, and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin and in Greek.	Sie rimbali i Yúraron hentaner tanwa sina, pan i nóme yasse Yésus náne tarwestaina caine hare i ostonna, ar anes técina Heveryasse, Latinde ar Hellenyasse.
But the chief priests of Jews said to Pilate: “Do not write: King of Jews, but that he said: I am King of Jews.”	Mal i hére airimor Yúraron quenter Pilátonna: “Áva tece: Aran Yúraron, mal i quentes: Inye ná Aran Yúraron.”
Pilate answered: “What I have written I have written.”	Piláto hanquente: “Ya etécien etécien.”
The soldiers, when they crucified Jesus, took his raiments and made four pieces, one piece for each soldier, and they took also his tunic. But the tunic was without seam , woven as a single piece from top to bottom.	I ohtari, íre tarwestanelte Yésus, namper larmaryar ar carner mittar canta, er mitta ilya ohtaren, ar nampelte yando lauperya. Mal i laupe náne pen yanwe, vírina ve erya mitta telmello talmanna.
Therefore they said, one to the other: “Let us not rend it, but let us cast lots about who will have it” – in order to fulfill the scripture that says: “They parted my robes among themselves, and about my tunic they cast lots.” And the soldiers indeed did so.	Etta quentelte, quén i exenna: “Ávalve narca sa, mal alve hate şanwali pa man samuva sa” – amaquatien i tehtele ya quete: “Ciltanelte larmanyar mici inte, ar pa laupenya hantelte şanwali.” Ar i ohtari é carner sie.
 stood beside Jesus’ cross his mother and his mother’s sister, Mary the mother of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.	Tarner ara Yésuo tarwe amillerya ar amilleryo néşa, María verirya Clópas, ar María Mahtaléne.
Thus, when Jesus saw his mother and the disciple that he loved standing there, he said to his mother: “Woman, behold your son!”	Sie, íre Yésus cenne amillerya ar i hildo ye méles tárala tasse, quentes amilleryanna: “Nís, ela yondotya!”
Then he said to the disciple: “Behold your mother!” And from that hour the disciple took her into his own house.	Tá quentes i hildonna: “Ela amillelya!” Ar sana lúmello i hildo nampe se mir véra coarya.
Thereafter, when Jesus saw that everything was completed, he said in order to fulfill the scripture: “I am thirsty.”	Epeta, íre Yésus cenne i ilqua náne telyaina, quentes amaquatien i tehtele: “Nanye soica.”
 was there a bowl full of sour wine, and they put a sponge on a spear and brought it to his mouth.	Enge tasse salpa quanta sára limpeo, ar panyanelte hwan ehtisse ar tulune sa antoryanna.
After receiving the sour wine, Jesus said: “It is completed!”, and he let his head drop and expired.	Apa camie i sára limpe, Yésus quente: “Nás telyaina!”, ar láves caryan lanta ar effirne.
Since this happened on the day of Preparation, the Jews requested from Pilate that their legs were to be broken and the bodies taken away, that they would not remain on the cross on the day of rest, for that day of rest was great.	Pan si martane i auresse Manwiéva, i Yúrar arcaner Pilálollo i telcoltat umnet rácine ar i hroar mapaine oa, i lá lemyumnelte i tarwesse i sendaresse, an sana sendare náne túra.
Therefore the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and the other who were crucified with him.	Etta i ohtari túler ar rancer i telcu i minyo ar i exeo yet nánet tarwestaine óse.
But coming to Jesus they saw that he was already dead and did not break his legs.	Mal túlala Yésunna cennelte i anes nollo qualin ar uar rance telcoryat.
And yet one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and in the same moment blood and water came out.	Ananta quén i ohtarion terne etterya ehtinen, ar mí imya lú serce ar nén ettúlet.
And who has seen it has witnessed, and his witness is true, and he knows that he is telling true things, that also you will believe.	Ar ye sa-ecénie evettie, ar vettierya nanwa ná, ar sé ista i nyáras nanwali, i yando lé savuvar.
For these things happened to fulfull the scripture: “A single bone of his body will not be broken.”	An nati sine martaner amaquatien i tehtele: “Erya axo hroaryo lá nauva rácina.”
And again, a different scripture says: “They will look at whom they have pierced.”	Ar ata, hyana tehtele quete: “Yétuvalte yenna etérielte.”
After these things Joseph from Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus, but in secred for fear of the Jews, made request from Pilate to take away Jesus’ body, and Pilate allowed it. Therefore he came and took his body away.	Apa nati sine Yósef Arimaşeallo, ye náne Yésus hildo, mal nuldiesse ruciénen i Yúrallon, arcane Pilátollo mapie oa Yésuo hroa, ar Piláto láve sa. Etta túles ar nampe hroarya oa.
Also Nicodemus, the man who came to him at night in the beginning, came bringing a blend of fragrant resin and eaglewood , around a hundred pounds.	Yando Nicorémus, i nér ye túle senna lómisse i yestasse, túle túlula ostime níşima suhteva ar şortoava, os lungwi tuxa.
Thus they took Jesus’ body and wrapped it in wraps with the fragrant herbs, according to Jews’ custom when they prepare a corpse for the grave.	Sie nampette Yésuo hroa ar vaitanet sa vaimalissen as i níşime laiqui, ve Yúraron haime íre manwalte loico i sapsan..
But in the place where he was crucified was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which nobody was yet put .	Mal i nómesse yasse anes tarwestaina enge tarwa, ar i tarwasse vinya noire, yasse úquen en náne panyaina.
Therefore they put Jesus’ body there, since that was Jews’ day of Preparation, and since the tomb was near.	Etta panyanette Yésuo hroa sanome, pan ta náne Yúraron aure Manwiéno, ar pan i noire hare né.
On the first day of the week Mary Magdalene came to the tomb early, when was still dark, and she saw that the rock was taken away from the tomb.	I minya auresse i otsolo María Mahtaléne túle i noirinna arinyave, íre en enge mornie, ar cennes i náne i ondo mapaina oa i noirillo.
Therefore she ran and came to Simon Peter and the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and said to them: “They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have put him.”	Etta nornes ar túle Símon Péterenna ar i hyana hildonna, ye Yésus méle, ar quente túna: “Amápielte i Heru et i noirillo, ar ualme ista yasse apánieltes.”
Then Peter went forth with the other disciple, and they went to the tomb.	Tá Péter etemenne as i hyana hildo, ar lendette i noirinna.
Both men ran, but the other other disciple ran faster than Peter and came first to the tomb,	Yúyo nér nornet, mal i hyana hildo norne linta lá Péter ar túle minya i noirinna,
and he bent and saw the clothes lying there, but he did not go in.	ar luhtanes ar cenne i lanni caitala tasse, mal uas lende minna.
Then Simon Peter came, following him, and he went into the tomb. He saw the wraps lying there,	Tá Símon Péter túle, hilyala se, ar lendes mir i noire. Cennes i vaimar caitala tasse,
and the cloth that was on his head, not lying with the wraps, but rolled up in a separate place.	ar i lanne ya enge caryasse, lá caitala as i vaimar, mal tolúna satya nómesse.
Then the other disciple, who came first to the tomb, also went in; and he saw and he believed.	Tá i hyana hildo, ye túle minya i noirinna, yando lende minna; ar cennes ar sáves.
For still they did not know the scripture, that was necessary for him to rise from dead.	An en uatte sinte i tehtele, i mauyane sen orta qualinillon.
Then the disciples returned to their homes.	Tá i hildor nanwenner marittannar.
But Mary stood crying by the tomb. And while she cried she bent to look into the tomb,	Mal María tarne nítala ara i noire. Ar íre nítanes luhtanes yétien mir i noire,
and she saw two angels in white sit , one by the head and one by the feet where Jesus’ body had been lying.	ar cennes vala atta mi ninque háma, quén ara i cas ar quén ara i talu yasse Yésuo hroa náne caitienwa.
They said to her: “Woman, for what reason are you crying?” She said to them: “They have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have put him.”	Quentette senna: “Nís, mana i casta yanen níteal?” Quentes túna: “Amápielte oa Herunya, ar uan ista yasse apánieltes.”
Saying this, she turned and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not know that he was Jesus.	Quétala si quernes immo ar cenne Yésus tárala tasse, mal uas sinte i anes Yésus.
Jesus said to her: “Woman, for what reason are you crying? Whom are you seeking?” Supposing that he was the gardener, she said to him: “Lord, if you have carried him away, tell me the place where you have put him, and I will take him away.”	Yésus quente senna: “Nís, mana i casta yanen níteal? Man cesteal?” Intyala i anes i tarwandur, quentes senna: “Heru, qui elye se-ocólie oa, nyara nin i nóme yasse apánielyes, ar inye se-mapuva oa.”
Jesus said to her: “Mary!” Turning, she said to him in Hebrew: “Rabboni” – which means teacher.	Yésus quente senna: “María!” Quérala immo, quentes senna Heveryasse: “Ravóni!” – ya tea peantar.
Jesus said to her: “Do not touch me, for I have not yet risen up to my Father. But go to my brothers and say to them: I am ascending to my Father and your Father, my God and your God.”	Yésus quente senna: “Ávani appa, an en uan ortanie amba Atarinyanna. Mal mena hánonyannar ar queta téna: Ortean Atarinyanna ar Atareldanna, Ainonyanna ar Ainoldanna.”
Mary Magdalene came and brought the news to the disciples: “I have seen the Lord!”, and that he said these things to her.	María Mahtaléne túle ar tulune i vinyar i hildonnar: “Ecénien i Heru!”, ar i quentes nati sine senna.
On the evening of that day, the first day of the week, when the doors were closed where the disciples were, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said to them: “Peace be to you!”	I şinyesse aure yano, i minya ré i otsolo, íre i fennar náner pahte yasse i hilmor enger, ruciénen i Yúrallon, Yésus túle ar tarne mici te ar quente téna: “Raine na len!”
After saying this she showed them his hands and his side. Then the disciples were happy when they saw the Lord.	Apa quetie si tannes tien máryat ar etterya. Tá i hildor nér alassie íre cennelte i Heru.
Jesus repeated to them: “Peace be to you! As the Father has sent me, so I send you.”	Yésus enquente téna: “Raine na len! Tambe i Atar ementie ní, síve inye menta lé.”
And after saying this he breathed on them and said to them: “Receive the Holy Spirit!	Ar apa quetie si şúyanes téna ar quente téna: “Cama i Aire Fea!
If you forgive peoples’ sins, they are forgiven them; if you retain peoples’ sins, they are retained.”	Qui apsenilde quenion úcari, nalte apsénine tien; qui tulcalde quenion úcari, nalte tulcaine.”
But Thomas, one of the twelve, called the Twin, was not with them when Jesus came.	Mal Tomas, quén i yunqueo, estaina i Onóno, úme aselte íre Yésus túle.
Thus the other disciples said to him: “We have seen the Lord!” But he said to them: “If I will not see in his hands the marks of the nails, and I do not put my hand in his side, I will not believe.”	Sie i hyane hildor quenter senna: “Ecénielme i Heru!” Mal quentes téna: “Qui uan cenuva máryatse i tehtar i taxion, ar uan panya ninya má etteryasse, lá savuvan.”
Eight days after this his disciples were again in the house, and Thomas was with them. The doors were closed, but Jesus came to them and said: “Peace be to you!”	Auri tolto apa si hilmoryar enger ata i coasse, ar Tomas enge aselte. I fennar nér pahte, mal Yésus túle téna ar quente: “Raine na len!”
Then he said to Thomas: “Put your finger here, and see my hands, and send your hand, and put it in my side; do not be unbelieving , but believing.”	Tá quentes Tomanna: “Á panya leperelya sís, ar cena mányat, ar á menta málya, ar ása panya ettenyasse; áva na savielóra, mal sávala.”
Thomas answered him: “My Lord and my God!”	Tomas hanquente senna: “Herunya ar Ainonya!”
Jesus said to him: “Do you believe because of seeing me? Happy are those who have not seen and yet believe.”	Yésus quente senna: “Ma savil ceniénen ni? Alassie nar i uar ecénie ananta savir.”
Jesus did also many other signs before the disciples, that are not written in this book;	Yésus carne yando rimbe hyane tannali epe i hildor, yar uar técine parma sinasse;
but these are written that you will believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you will have life by his name.	mal sine nar técine i savuvalde i Yésus ná i Hristo, i Eruion, ar i sávala samuvalde coivie esseryanen.
After these things Jesus revealed himself to the disciples by the Sea Tiberias; and he revealed himself thus:	Apa nati sine Yésus apantane immo i hildoin ata ara Ear Tiverias; ar apantanes immo sie:
 were together Simon Peter and Thomas, called the Twin, and Nathanael from Cana of Galilee and the sons of Zebedee and two other of his disciples.	Enger uo Símon Péter ar Tomas, estaina i Onóno, ar Natanael Cánallo Alileo ar Severaio yondor ar exe atta hildoryaron.
Simon Peter said to them: “I am going to catch some fishes.” They said to him: “We too are coming with you.” They went out and went into the boat, but through that night they caught nothing.	Símon Péter quente téna: “Ménan raitien lingwili.” Quentelte senna: “Yando elme túlar aselye.” Etemennelte ar lender mir i lunte, mal ter lóme yana raitanelte munta.
But when morning came, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples did not understand that he was Jesus.	Mal íre arin túle, Yésus tarne i fárasse, ono i hildor uar hanyane i anes Yésus.
Then Jesus said to them: “My children, have you not got fishes?” They said to him: “We have not.”	Tá Yésus quente téna: “Hinyar, ma ualde same lingwi?” Hanquentelte senna: “Penilme.”
He said to them: “Throw the net at the right of the boat and you will find some fishes!” So they threw it, and then they could not draw it up for the number of fishes.	Quentes téna: “Hata i rembe i foryasse i lunteo ar hiruvalde lingwili!” Sie hanteltes, ar tá ualte polde tucitas amba i nótenen lingwilíva.
Therefore the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter: “He is the Lord!” Thus Simon Peter, hearing that he was the Lord, girded himself with his jacket, for he was naked, and threw himself into the sea.	Etta i hildo ye Yésus méle quente Péterenna: “Náse i Heru!” Sie Símon Péter, hlárala i anes i Heru, quiltane immo vaccoryanen, an anes helda, ar hante immo mir i ear.
But the other disciples came in the boat – for they were not far from land, only around a hundred yards – drawing the net of fishes.	Mal i hyane hildor túler i luntenen – an úmelte haire nórello, er os rangar tuxa – túcala i rembe lingwion.
But when they stood off onto land they saw a coal fire lie there and some fishes lying on it, and bread.	Mal íre hótarnelte nórenna cennelte caitea tasse hyulmaruine ar lingwili caitala sanna, ar massa.
Jesus said to them: “Bring some fishes of those you caught now.”	Yésus quente téna: “Á tulu lingwili ion raitanelde sí.”
Therefore Simon Peter went into the boat and drew the net ashore , full of a hundred and fifty-three huge fishes. But though they were that many, the net was not torn.	Etta Símon Péter lende mir i lunte ar tunce i rembe nórenna, quanta haure lingwion nelde lepenquean ar tuxa. Mal ómu anelte ta rimbe, i rembe úme narcaina.
Jesus said to them: “Come, have breakfast!” No one of the disciples dared to ask him: “Who are you?”, since they knew that he was the Lord.	Eque téna Yésus: “Tula, sama arinwat!” Úquen i hildoron veryane maquete senna: “Man elye?”, pan sintelte i anes i Heru.
Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and also the fishes.	Yésus túle ar nampe i massa ar antane sa tien, ar yando i lingwi.
This was the third time that Jesus revealed himself to the disiciples after he was raised from dead.	Si náne i neldea lú yasse Yésus apantane immo i hildoin apa anes ortaina qualinillon.
When they had eaten the breakfast Jesus said to Simon Peter: “Simon son of John, do you love me more than them?” Peter said to him: “Yes, Lord, you know that you are dear to me.” He said to him: “Give food to my lambs.”	Íre anelte mátienwe i arinwat Yésus quente Símon Péterenna: “Símon Yohánion, ma melil ní ambe lá té?” Eque senna Péter: “Ná, Heru, istalye i nalye melda nin.” Quentes senna: “Á anta matso eulenyain!”
Again he said to him, a second time: “Simon Peter, do you love me?” He said to him: “Yes, Lord, you know that you are dear to me.” He said to him: “Be a shepherd for my sheep!”	Ata eques senna, attea lússe: “Símon Péter, ma melilyen?” Quentes senna: “Ná, Heru, istal i nalye melda nin.” Eques senna: “Na mavar mámanyain!”
He said to him a third time: “Simon son of John, am I dear to you?” Peter felt grief because he said to him a third time: “Am I dear to you?” Thus he said to him: “Lord, you know everything; you know that you are dar to me!” Jesus said to him: “Give food to my lambs.	Quentes senna neldea lússe: “Símon Yohánion, ma nanye melda lyen?” Péter felle nyére pan quentes senna i neldea lússe: “Ma nanye melda lyen?” Sie eques senna: “Heru, elye ista ilqua; elye ista i nalye melda nin!” Yésus quente senna: “Á anta matso eulenyain.
Truly, truly I say to you: When you were younger, you girded yourself and walked where you wished. But when you shall be old, you will reach out with your hands and another will gird you and lead you where you do not wish.”	Násie, násie quetin lyenna: Íre anel ambe nessa, quiltanel immo ar vantane yasse mernel. Mal íre nauval yára, eterahtuval mályanten ar exe lye-quiltuva ar lye-tulyuva yanna ual mere.”
This he said to show the kind of death by which he was going to bring glory to God. And after this he said to him: “Follow me.”	Si quentes tanien i nostale qualmeo yanen talumnes alcar Erun. Ar apa quetie si quentes senna: “Áni hilya.”
When he turned , Peter saw the disciple whom Jesus loved follow – the person who at the evening meal was leaning towards his chest and said: “Lord, who is who betrays you?”	Íre quernes immo, Péter cenne i hildo ye Yésus méle hilyea – i quén ye i şinyematse náne talta ambostyanna ar quente: “Heru, man ná ye varta lye?”
Therefore, when Peter saw him, he said to Jesus: “Lord, what will this man do?”	Etta, íre Péter cenne se, quentes Yésunna: “Heru, mana nér sina caruva?”
Jesus said to him: “If my will is that he will remain until I come, what is that to you? You follow me!”	Eque senna Yésus: “Qui şelmanya ná i lemyuvas tenna tulin, mana ta lyen? Elye áni hilya!”
Therefore this saying went out among the disciples: “That disciple will not die.” But Jesus did not say to him that he was not going to die, but: “If my will is that he will remain until I come, what is that to you?”	Etta quetie sina etemenne imíca i hildor: “Sana hildo ua qualuva.” Mal Yésus ua quente senna i uas qualumne, mal: “Qui şelmanya ná i lemyuvas tenna tulin, mana ta lyen?”
He is the disciple who witnesses about this and who has written these things, and we know that his witness is true.	Sé ná i hildo ye vetta pa si ar ye etécie nati sine, ar istalme i vettierya nanwa ná.
But are also many other things that Jesus has done. If one were to write about every single thing, I suppose that there is not enough place in the world itself for the books being written.	Mal ear yando rimbe hyane natali yar Yésus acárie. Qui mo tecumne pa ilya erya nata, intyan i lá ea fárea nóme mí mar imma i parmain nála técine.
Jude, slave of Jesus Christ, but brother of Jacob , to the called ones that are loved by God the Father and kept for Jesus Christ:	Yúr, Yésus Hristo mól, mal Yácovo háno, i yálinannar i nar méline lo Eru i Atar ar hépine Yésus Hriston:
May you have mercy and peace and love in abundance!	Nai samuvalde óravie ar raine ar melme úvesse!
Beloved ones, though with every urgency I wanted to write to you about the salvation in which you and I alike have a part, it was necessary for me to write to you in order to exhort you: Fight for the faith that once and for always has been given to the holy ones!	A meldar, ómu ilya hormenen mernen tece lenna pa i rehtie yasse lé ar ní véla samir ranta, mauyane nin tece lenna hortien le: Á mahta i savien ya mi lú er ar illumen anaie antaina i airin!
For some people have cleverly come in, that long ago were reserved for judgement by the Scriptures – wicked ones, who turn the grace into an opportunity for loose conduct, and deny our sole Leader and Lord, Jesus Christ.	An quelli fincave utúlier minna, i andanéya náner sátine námien lo i Tehtele – olcali, i querir i Erulisse mir ecie lehta lengiéno, ar lalar erya Cánolva ar Herulva, Yésus Hristo.
I want to remind you, though you know everything once and for always: The Lord, after saving a people out of Egypt, thereafter destroyed the ones that did not believe.	Merin renta le, ómu istalde ilqua er lú illumen: I Héru, apa rehtie lie et Mirrandorello, epeta nancarne i uar sáve.
And the angels that did not keep the positions that they had in the beginning, but abandoned their own place, he has reserved for everlasting bonds under gloom for the judgement on the great day.	Ar i vali i uar himyane i meni yar sámelte i yestasse, mal hehtaner véra nómelta, asáties oialie nótelínen nu huine i námien mí túra aure.
Thus also Sodom and Gomorra and the cities around them are put before us as a sign of danger, for they fornicated and had a lust for foreign flesh, and now they have received the punishment of eternal fire.	Sie yando Sorom yo Omorra ar i ostor os tú nar panyaine epe vi ve tanwa raxeo, an úpuhtanelte ar sámer maile ettelea hráveva, ar sí acámielte i paime oialea náreva.
Thus also these dreamy people stain the flesh and turn away lordship, blaspheming against glorious ones.	Sie yando sine oloste queni vahtar i hráve ar querir oa hére, naiquétala alcarinquannar.
But when Michael the Chief Angel quarreled with the Devid and had a dispute concerning the body of Moses, he did not dare to speak to him with mockery, but he said: «May the Lord rebuke you!»	Mal íre Mícael i Héra Vala costane as i Arauco ar sáme cos pa hroarya Móses, uas veryane quete senna yaiwenen, mal eques: «Nai i Héru tulcarpuva lyenna!»
And yet these men blaspheme against all the things that they do not understand, but the things that they do understand – by their nature, like animals without intellect – by those they corrupt themselves.	Ananta neri sine naiquetir ilye i natinnar yar ualte hanya, mal i nati yar é hanyalte – nasseltanen, ve celvar ú handeleo – tainen hastaltexer.
Woe to them, for they have walked in the path of Cain, and into the error of Balaam they have thrown themselves, to receive reward, and they have undone themselves in the uprising of Korah.	Horro tien, an avantielte mi tierya Cain, ar mir loimarya Valam hanteltexer, camien paityale, ar nanacárielte inte mi amortierya Córa.
They are the rocks hidden under water at your feasts of love, shepherds that feed themselves without fear, clouds without water, carried hither and thither by wind, trees in autumn, without fruit, two times having died, drawn up with their roots,	Té nar i ondor nurtaine nu nén merendildassen melmeva, mavalli i maitar inte ú caureo, lumbuli ú neno, cóline sir yo tar súrinen, aldali mi quelle, ú yáveo, lú atta quálienwe, túcine ama as ºundultar,
wild waves of the sea, foaming with their own reasons for being ashamed, errant stars, for whom the gloom of darkness is reserved forever.	hravani falmali i earo, falastala vére castaltainen náven naityana, ránie tinweli, in i huine morniéva ná sátina tennoio.
Indeed the seventh in the descent from Adam , Enoch, spoke a prophecy about them, saying: «Behold! The Lord came with his holy myriads ,	É i otsea i ontalesse Atanello, Énoc, quente apacen pa té, quétala: «Yé! I Héru túle as airi quaihúmeryar,
in order to do judgement against all, and to give rebuke to all the wicked ones about all their wicked deeds that they have done wickedly, and about all the blasphemies that the wicked sinners have spoken against him.»	carien námie ilinnar, ar tulcarpien ilye i olcannar pa ilye olce cardaltar yar acárielte olcave, ar pa ilye i naiquetier yar i olce úcarindor equétier senna.»
These people are grumbling, speaking evil about their fate, walking in their own desires, and their mouths speak big words; with honey on their tongue they speak to others for their own gain.	Queni sine nar nurrula, quétala ulco pa umbartalta, vantala vére íreltassen, ar antoltar quetir hoe quettali; arwe lisso lambaltasse carpalte exennar véra ñételtan.
But you, beloved ones, remember the saying spoken beforehand by the apostles of Jesus Christ our lord,	Mal elde, a meldar, enyala i quetier quétine nóvo lo Yésus Hristo Herulvo aposteli,
how they said to you: «In the last time will come people speaking mockery, walking in their own desires of wicked things.»	manen quentelte lenna: «I métima lúmesse tuluvar quelli quétala yaiwe, vantala vére íreltassen olce nativa.»
They are the ones causing splits, men like animals, lacking spirit.	Té nar i tyarir ºancier, neri ve celvar, pénala faire.
But you, beloved ones, build yourselves with your most holy faith, and pray with Holy Spirit.	Mal elde, a meldar, á carasta inde amaire savieldanen, ar hyama Aire Feanen.
Thus keep yourselves in God's love, while you look forward to the mercy of Jesus Christ our Lord, in order to receive eternal life.	Sie hepa inde Eruo melmesse, íre yétalde ompa Yésus Hristo Herulvo óravienna, camien oira coivie.
Furthermore, have mercy on the people the faith of whom is unsteady;	Ente, alde órava i quenissen ion savie ná iltanca;
save them by snatching them out of the fire. On these people have mercy, but take heed, loathing even a cloth stained by the flesh.	áte rehta rapiénen te et i ruivello. Sine quenissen órava, mal cima, yeltala yando lanne vahtaina i hrávenen.
To the one that can guard you from falling and put you unmarred before his glory with great joy,	Yen pole tire le lantiello ar panya le alahaste epe alcarerya arwe túra alasseo,
to the one God, to the one who saves us through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty , power and lordship throughout the entire past eternity and now and forever! Amen!	erya Erun, yen vi-rehta ter Yésus Hristo Herulva, na alcar, melehte, túre ar hére ter i quenda vanwa oiale ar sí ar tennoio! Násie!
Since numerous ones have taken into hand to compose an account about the things that have happened among us,	Pan rimbali amápier mir má partie nyarna pa i nati yar amartier mici me,
as we received them from who first were witnesses and servants of the word,	ve acámielmet illon minyave náner astarmoli ar núroli i quetto,
it seemed good also to me, after following all things closely from the beginning, to write them as chronological account for you, glorious Theophilus,	şéne mára yando nin, apa hilie ilye nati harive i yestallo, tece tai ve lúmequenta elyen, alcarinqua Şeofílo,
for you to know the firm foundation of the things about which you have been instructed.	istielyan i tanca talma i nation pa yar anaiel peantaina.
In the days of Herod, king of Judea, was a priest called Zechariah, of the division of Abiah, and he had a wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.	Auressen Herolo, aran Yúreo, enge airimo estaina Secaría, i ciltiéno Avio, ar sámes veri Árono yeldion, ar esserya náne Elísavet.
And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and laws in a perfect manner.	Ar anette yúyo faile epe Eru, vantala ilye i axanissen ar şanyessen mi ilvana lé.
But was not child with them, for Elizabeth could not conceive, and both had many years.	Mal ua enge hína asette, an Elísavet ua polle nosta, ar yúyo sámet rimbe loali.
The turn came to his division, and he did the priest's work before God.	I lú túle ciltieryanna, ar carnes i airimo molie epe Eru.
By throwing lots, as the custom of the priests was, it fell upon him to go into God's santuary to burn incence.	Hatiénen şanwali, ve i airimoron lé náne, lantane senna mene mir i Héruo yána urtien nisque.
And the entire multitude of the people stood in prayer on the outside at the hour of burning incence.	Ar i quanda rimbe i lieo tarne hyamiesse i ettesse i lúmesse urtiéva nisque.
Then the Lord's angel showed himself to him, standing at the right of the altar of incence.	Tá i Héruo vala tannexe sen, tárala foryasse i yangwava nisqueva.
But Zechariah was troubled at seeing him, and fear fell upon him.	Mal Secaría náne tarastaina ceniénen se, ar caure lantane senna.
But the angel said to him: “Do not fear, Zechariah, for your petition has been heard, and Elizabeth your wife will be mother to a son to you, and you are to give him the name John.	Mal i vala quente senna: “Áva ruce, Secaría, an arcandelya anaie hlárina, ar Elísavet verilya nauva amil yondon lyen, ar alye anta sen i esse Yoháno.
And you will have joy and happiness, and numerous ones will be happy since he has been born,	Ar samuval alasse ar márie, ar rimbali nauvar valime pan anaies nóna,
for he will be great before the Lord, and wine and strong drink he is not to drink, and he will be filled with Holy Spirit all the way from his mother's womb.	an nauvas túra epe i Héru, ar limpe ar polda yulda ávas suce, ar nauvas quátina Aire Feanen aqua et amilleryo mónallo.
And numerous ones of the sons of Israel he will turn back to the Lord their God,	Ar rimbali yondoron Israélo nanqueruvas i Héru Ainoltanna,
and he will go before him in Elijah's spirit and power, to turn back the hearts of fathers to children and the refusers to the insight of just ones, to put before the Lord a prepared people.”	ar sé menuva epe se mi Elío faire ar túre, nanquerien atarion endar hínannar ar i avari i tercenna failaron, panien epe i Héru manwaina lie.”
And Zechariah said to the angel: “How can I know this thing? For I am old, and my wife has many years.”	Ar Secaría quente i valanna: “Manen polin ista nat sina? An nanye yára, ar verinya same rimbe loali.”
In answer the angel said to him: “I Gabriel, who stands before God, and I was sent forth to speak with you and to make the good news about these things known to you.	Hanquentasse i vala quente senna: “Inye Avriel, ye tare epe Eru, ar anen etementaina carpien aselye ar carien i máre sinyar pa nati sine sinwe lyen.
But behold! you will be silent and will not be able to speak until the day when these things will happen, since you did not believe in my words, which will be made true in their time.”	Mal yé! nauval quilda ar ua poluva quete tenna i aure yasse nati sine martuvar, pan ual sáve quettanyassen, yar nauvar cárine nanwe lúmeltasse.”
And the people waited for Zechariah, and they were in wonder since he was so long in the sanctuary.	Ar i lie lartane Secarían, ar anelte elmendasse pan anes ta andave i yánasse.
But when he came out he could not speak to them, and they perceived that he saw a vision in the sanctuary, and he made gestures to them, still being dumb.	Mal íre ettúles uas polle carpa téna, ar túnelte i cennes maur i yánasse, ar carnes hwermeli tien, en nála úpa.
When the days of his service were complete, he went away to his house.	Íre i auri veuyaleryo náner telyaine, oantes coaryanna.
But after these days Elizabeth conceived, and she secluded herself from others for six months, saying:	Mal apa auri sine Elísavet nostane, ar lanyanes inse exellon ter astari lempe, quétala:
“Thus the Lord has done to me, in the days in which he heeded me to take away my humiliation among men.”	“Sie i Héru acárie nin, mí auri yassen cimnes ni mapien oa nucumnienya mici atani.”
In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city in Galilee called Nazareth,	I enquea astaresse i vala Avriel náne mentaina Erullo ostonna Alileasse estaina Nasaret,
to a maiden engaged to a man called Joseph, of the kin of David, and the maiden's name was Mary.	vendenna nauta verien nér estaina Yósef, Laviro nosseo, ar i vendeo esse náne María.
And when the angel went inside before her, he said: “Greetings, you who have received grace; the Lord with you.	Ar íre i vala lende minna epe se, quentes: “Hara máriesse, elye ye acámie Eruanna; i Héru aselye.”
But Mary was troubled by the saying and tried to understand what kind of greeting that was.	Mal Mária náne tarastaina i quetiénen ar néve hanya mana nostale suiliéva ta náne.
And the angel said to her: “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God,	Ar i vala quente senna: “Áva ruce, María, an ihíriel lisse as Eru,
and behold! you will conceive in your womb and will bear a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus.	ar yé! nostuval mónalyasse ar coluva yondo, ar alye anta sen i esse Yésus.
He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High, for the Lord God will give him David his father's throne,	Sé nauva túra ar nauva estaina i Antaro Yondo, ar i Héru Eru antuva sen Lavir ataryo mahalma,
and he will rule over Jacob's house forever, and will not be end of his kingdom.”	ar turuvas Yácovo nosse tennoio, ar ua euva metta aranieryo.”
But Mary said to the angel: “How will this thing happen, since I do not know a man?”	Mal María quente i valanna: “Manen nat sina martuva, pan uan ista nér?”
And in answer the angel said to her: “Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; thus also the holy being born will be called God's Son.	Ar hanquentasse i vala quente senna: “Aire Fea tuluva lyenna, ar i Antaro túre teltuva lye; sie yando i aire nála nóna nauva estaina Eruo Yondo.
And behold! Elizabeth, who is of your kin, has herself conceived a son in her old age, and this month is the sixth for her who was called unfruitful.	Ar yé! Elísavet, ye ná nosselyo, inse onostie yondo yárieryasse, ar astar sina ná i enquea sen ye náne estaina yávelóra.
For to God is nothing impossible.”	An Erun ea munta úcárima.”
Then Mary said: “Behold the servant-girl of the Lord! May it happen to me as you have said.” And the angel went away from her.	Tá María quente: “Ela i Héruo núre! Nai martuva nin ve equétiel.” Ar i vala oante sello.
But in those days Mary arose and went with urgency to a city in Judea,	Mal yane auressen María oronte ar lende hormenen ostonna Yúreasse,
and she went into the hpise of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth.	ar mennes mir coarya Secaría ar suilane Elísavet.
When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the babe in her womb jumped, and Elizabeth was filled with Holy Spirit,	Íre Elísavet hlasse Marío suilie, i lapse mónaryasse campe, ar Elísavet náne quátina Aire Feanen,
and she cried with a great voice and said: “Blessed you among women, and blessed the fruit of your womb!	ar yámes taura ómanen ar quente: “Aistana elye imíca nissi, ar aistana i yáve mónalyo!
And how is that this thing has happened to me, that my Lord's mother is coming to me?”	Ar manen ná i nat sina amartie nin, i Herunyo amil túla ninna?
And behold! when the sound of your greeting came to my ears, the babe in my womb jumped with great joy!	An yé! íre suilielyo lamma túle hlarunyanta, i lapse mónanyasse campe túra alassenen!
Happy she who believed that will be made true the things spoken to her by the Lord!”	Valima sé ye sáve i nauvar cárine nanwe i nati quétine senna lo i Héru!”
Then Mary said: “My soul praises the Lord,	Tá María quente: “Feanya laita i Héru,
and my spirit is in joy by God my Savior,	ar fairenya ná mi alasse Eru Rehtonyanen,
for he has seen the lowly state of his maidservant. And behold! from now all generations will call me happy,	an ecénies núreryo naldie. Ar yé! ho sí ilye nónari estuvar ni valima,
for the Mighty One has done great deeds to me, and holy is his name;	an i Taura acárie túre cardali nin, ar aire ná esserya;
and through generations and generations his mercy is upon that love him.	ar ter nónaréli ar nónaréli oravierya ea issen melir se.
He has done mighty things, he has scattered that are haughty in the thoughts of their hearts.	Acáries taure natali, ivinties i nar turinque endalto sanwessen.
He threw down mighty ones from thrones and raised up lowly ones;	Hantes undu taurali mahalmallon ar ortane naldali;
he has filled the hungry ones with good things and has sent away empty that had riches.	aquáties i maitar máre natalínen ar ementie oa luste i sámer lar.
He has helped Israel his servant, to recall mercy,	Amánies Israel núroryan, enyalien oravie,
as he told to our fathers, to Abraham and to his kin, forever.	ve nyarnes atarilvain, Avrahámen ar nosseryan, tennoio.”
And Mary remained with Elizabeth around three months. Then she returned to her house.	Ar María lemyane as Elísavet os astari nelde. Tá nanwennes coaryanna.
For Elizabeth came the time for bearing her baby, and she bore a son.	Elisavéten túle i lúme colien lapserya, ar colles yondo.
And the neighbors and the people of her kin heard that the Lord gave her great mercy, and they were in joy with her.	Ar i armaror ar nosseryo queni hlasser i sen-antane i Héru túra oravie, ar anelte mi alasse óse.
And on the eight day they came to circumcise the child, and they were going to call it by his father's name, Zecharia.	Ar i toltea auresse túlelte oscirien i hína, ar estumneltes ataryo essenen, Secaría.
But its mother answered and said: “No, but its name shall be John.”	Mal amillerya hanquente ar eque: “Vá, mal esserya nauva Yoháno.”
Then they said to her: “ is no one in your family that has that name.”	Tá quentelte senna: “Ea úquen nosselyasse ye same esse tana.”
Then they sought an answer from the father by gestures, what name he wanted for the child.	Tá cestanelte hanquenta i atarello hwermelínen, mana esse mernes i hínan.
And he requested a tablet and wrote: “His name is John.” And all among them were in wonder.	Ar arcanes palma ar tence: “Esserya ná Yoháno.” Ar illi mici te náner elmendasse.
At the same moment his mouth was opened and his tongue loosened, and he spoke, blessing God.	Mí imya lú antorya náne pantaina ar lamberya lehtaina, ar quentes, aistala Eru.
And fear fell upon all his neighbors, and in the whole mountain-region in Judea one talked about all these things,	Ar rucie lantane ilye armaroryannar, ar mí quanda ortoména Yúreasse mo caramper pa ilye nati sine,
and all that heard perceived it in their heart, saying: “What indeed will this child be?” For also the Lord's hand was with him.	ar illi i hlasser túner sa endaltasse, quétala: “É mana nauva hína sina?” An yando i Héruo má enge óse.
And Zecharia his father was filled with Holy Spirit and spoke as a prophet, saying:	Ar Secaría atarya náne quátina Aire Feanen ar quente ve Erutercáno, quétala:
“Blessed be the Lord, God of Israel, since he has heeded and has delivered his people!	“Na aistana i Héru, Israélo Aino, pan icímies ar etelehties lierya!
And he raised for us a horn of salvation in David his servant's house,	Ar ortanes ven rasse rehtiéva Lavir núroryo coasse,
as he has spoken through the mouth of his holy heralds from out of the past,	ve equéties ter anto i airi tercánoryaron et i vanwiello,
about salvation from our enemies and from the hand of that hate us,	pa rehtie ñottolvallon ar ho i má ion tevir ve,
to show mercy on our fathers and to recall his holy covenant,	tanien oravie atarilvassen ar enyalien aire vérerya,
the oath that he gave to Abraham our father,	i vanda ya antanes Avraham atarelvan,
to allow us to be servants for him after we were saved from the hand of our enemies,	lavien ven náve núroli sen apa anelve rehtaine ho ñottolvaron má,
in holiness and justness before him in all our days.	airesse ar failiesse epe se ilye aurelvassen.
But you, child, shall be called prophet of the Most High, for you will go before the Lord to prepare his ways,	Mal tyé, hína, nauva estaina Erutercáno i Antaro, an menuvatye epe i Heru manwien malleryar,
to give knowledge of salvation to his people by forgiveness of their sins,	antien istya rehtiéno lieryan apseniénen úcareltaiva,
by our God's compassion of mercy, by which a sunrise out of high will come upon us,	Ainolvo ofelmenen oraviéno, yanen anaróre et tarmenello tuluva venna,
in order to give glory to that sit in darkness and death-shadow, to lead our feet on the path of peace.”	antien alcar in hámar morniesse ar ñuruhuinesse, tulien talulvat i tiesse raineva.”
And the child grew and was made mighty in spirit, and he was in the deserts until the day when he was going to show himself to Israel.	Ar i hína alle ar náne carna taura fairesse, ar anes i erumessen tenna i aure yasse tanumnes inse Israélen.
And it happened in those days that a command went forth from Augustus the High King, that one was to count the whole world.	Ar túle ente auressen i etelende canwa Auhusto i Ingaranello, i mo notumne i quanda mar.
This first counting occurred while Qurinius was ruler of Syria.	Minya notie sina martane íre Quirinio náne cáno Sírio.
All people went in order to be counted, everyone to his own city.	Ilye queni lender náven nótine, ilquen véra ostoryanna.
Also Joseph went up from Galilee, out of the city Nazareth, into Judea, to David’s city, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of David’s house and family,	Yando Yósef lende ama Alileallo, et i ostollo Nasaret, mir Yúrea, Laviro ostonna, ya ná estaina Vet-Lehem, pan anes maro ar nosseo Laviro,
in order to be counted with Mary who was given to him in marriage, and who now was pregnant .	náven nótina as María ye náne antaina sen vestalesse, ar ye sí náne lapsarwa.
While they were there, the time came when she was to bear her baby.	Íre engette tasse, i lúme túle yasse columnes lapserya.
And she bore her son, the firstborn, and swaddled him and put him in a manger , since was not room for them at the inn.	Ar colles yondorya, i minnóna, ar se-vaitanes ar panyane se salquecolcasse, pan ua enge tún nóme mí sendasse.
 were some shepherds in that same country that dwelt in the field, watching their flocks in the night.	Enger mavalli i imya nóresse i marner i restasse, tírala lámáreltar i lómisse.
And the Lord’s angel stood by them, and the Lord’s glory shone about them, and great fear seized them.	Ar i Héruo vala tarne ara te, ar i Héruo alcar caltane os te, ar túra caure nampe te.
But the angel said to them: ”Do not be afraid, for I am making known to you a great joy that will be for the entire people,	Mal i vala quente téna: ”Áva ruce, pan inye cára sinwa len túra alasse ya nauva i quanda lien,
for has been born to you today a Saviour, who is Christ, the Lord, in the city of David.	an anaie cólina len síra Rehto, ye ná Hristo, i Heru, Laviro ostosse.
And this will be for you a sign: You will find an infant, swaddled and lying in a manger.”	Ar si nauva tanwa len: Hiruvalde vinimo, vaitana ar caitala salquecolcasse.”
And suddenly was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly army, praising God and saying:	Ar rincanen enge as i vala rimbe i meneldea hosseo, laitala Eru ar quétala:
“Glory be in the high places to God, and on earth peace to the men of whom he thinks well.”	”Alcar i tarmenissen na Erun, ar cemende raine i atanin pa i sanas mai.”
And after the angels went away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to the other: ”Let us go to Bethlehem to see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us.”	Ar apa i vali oanter tello mir menel, i mavari quenter quén i exenna: ”Alve lelya Vet-Lehemenna cenien nat sina ya amartie, ya i Héru acárie sinwa ven.”
And they went with urgency and found Mary and Joseph and the infant lying in the manger.	Ar lendelte hormenen ar hirner María ar Yósef ar i vinimo caitala i salquecolcasse.
When they saw him, they made known the things that were said to them about this child.	Íre cennelte se, carnelte sinwe i nati yar náner quétine téna pa hína sina.
And wonder seized everyone hearing about the things told to them by the shepherds,	Ar elmenda nampe ilquen hlárala pa i nati nyárine ten lo i mavari,
but Mary kept these sayings and thought about them in her heart.	mal María hempe ilye quetier sine ar sanne pa tai endaryasse.
Then the shepherds went back, giving glory and praise to God about everything that they heard and saw, wholly as that was told to them.	Tá i mavari nanwenner, antala alcar ar laitale Erun pa ilqua ya hlasselte ar cennelte, aqua ve ta náne nyárina ten.
And when the eighth day came, for him to be circumcised, he received the name Jesus, with which the angel called him before he was conceived in the womb.	Ar íre i toltea auresse túle, náveryan oscirna, camnes i esse Yésus, yanen i vala estane se nó anes nostaina i mónasse.
When the days of purification were completed by the Law of Moses, they brought him to Jerusalem to place him before the Lord,	Íre i auri poiciéva náner telyaine Móseo Şanyenen, tallettes Yerúsalemenna panien se epe i Héru,
as is written in the Law of the Lord: “Every male opening a womb will be called holy to the Lord”,	ve ná técina i Héruo Şanyesse: “Ilya hanu pantala súma nauva estaina aire i Hérun”,
and to bring a sacrifice as is written in the Law of the Lord: “Two turtledoves or two young doves.”	ar talien yanca ve ná quétina i Héruo Şanyesse: “Cucuolle atta hya nessa cucuo atta.”
And behold! was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon, and this man was just and fearing God, looking forward to the comfort of Israel, and holy spirit lay upon him.	Ar yé! enge nér Yerúsalemesse yeo esse náne Símeon, ar nér sina náne faila ar rúcala Erullo, yétala ompa i tiutalenna Israelwa, ar aire fea caine senna.
Furthermore, it was revealed to him that he was not going to see death before seeing the Christ of the Lord.	Ente, náne sen apantaina i uas cenumne qualme nó cenie i Héruo Hristo.
By the Spirit he now came to the temple, and when the parents brought the child Jesus to do to him what was usual by the Law,	I Fairenen sí túles i cordanna, ar íre i nostaru tallet i hína Yésus carien sen ya náne senwa i Şanyenen,
Simeon himself received him into his arms, and he praised God and said: “Now, Master, you will allow your servant to pass away in peace as you have said,	Símeon immo camne se mir rancuryat, ar laitanes Eru ar quente: “Sí, Tur, lavuval mólelyan auta rainesse ve equétiel,
for my eyes have seen your salvation,	an hendunyat ecéniet rehtielya,
that you have prepared before all the peoples,	ya amanwiel epe ilye i lier,
a light to take away the veil from the nations and a glory to Israel your people.	cala mapien oa i vaşar i nórellon ar alcar Israel lielyan.”
And his father and his mother were were in wonder about the things said about him.	Ar atarya yo amillerya nánet elmendasse pa i nati quétine pa se.
And Simeon blessed them, but he said to Mary his mother: “Behold, this one has been placed for the fall and for the rising of numeous ones in Israel, and a sign that one speaks against,	Ar Símeon aistane tu, mal quentes María amilleryanna: “Yé, si anaie panyaina i lanten ar i ortien rimbalion Israelde, ar tanwa yanna mo quete,
indeed a sword will go through your own soul – to reveal the thoughts of numerous hearts.”	– é lango menuva ter véra fealya – apantien rimbe endaron sanwi.”
And was a woman called Anna, daughter of Fanuel of the tribe of Asher, who was a prophet. She was old and had many years, after she dwelt with a man for seven years after her virginhood,	Ar enge nís estaina Anna, yelderya Fanuel nosseo Ahyero, ye náne Erutercáne. Anes yára ar sáme rimbe loali, apa marnes as nér ter loar otso apa venesserya,
and thereafter she was widowed until she now had eighty-four years. She was not ever away from the temple, but she served God day and night, fasting and calling upon him.	ar epeta anes verulóra tenna sí sámes loar canta toloquean. Únes oi oa i cordallo, mal veuyanes Eru auresse yo lómisse, avamátala ar yálala senna.
And in that hour she arose and gave thanks to God, and she talked about the child to all that looked forward to the deliverance of Jerusalem.	Ar yana lúmesse orontes ar antane Erun hantale, ar carampes pa i hína ilyannar i yenter ompa i ehtelehtienna Yerúsalenwa.
And after they completed everything by the Law of the Lord they returned to Galilee and their city, Nazareth.	Ar apa telyanette ilqua i Héruo Şanyenen nanwennette Alileanna ar ostottanna, Násaret.
And the child grew and started to be strong, being filled with wisdom, and grace rested on him.	Ar i hína alle ar yestane náve polda, nála quátina sailiénen, ar Erulisse caine senna.
Every year his parents went to Jerusalem, to the festival of Passover.	Ilya loasse nostaruryat lendet Yerúsalemanna, i aşarenna Lahtiéno.
And when he had twelve years, they went according to the habit of the festival	Ar íre sámes loar yunque, lendelte ama i aşaro haimenen
and completed the days. But when they returned, Jesus the boy remained in Jerusalem, and his parents did not notice it.	ar telyaner i auri. Mal íre nanwennette, Yésus i seldo lemyane Yerúsalemesse, ar nostaruryat uat túne sa.
Thinking that he was among the people traveling together, they went a distance of one day; then they sought him among the people of their kin and the people that they knew.	Sánala i anes imíca i queni lelyala uo, lendette er aureo tie; tá cestanettes mici i queni nossetto ar i queni i sintette.
But when they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem, seeking him.	Mal íre uatte hirne se, entúlette Yerúsalemenna, cestala se.
And after three days they found him in the temple, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them.	Ar apa auri nelde hirnettes i cordasse, hámala imíca i peantari, lastala téna ar maquétala téna.
But all that listened to him were startled by his understanding and by his answers.	Mal illi i lastaner senna náner captaine handeryanen ar hanquentaryainen.
Now when they saw him they were in wonder, and his mother said to him: “Child, what is your reason for doing so to us? Behold, your father and I were tormented, seeking you!”	Sí íre cennettes anette elmendasse, ar amillerya quente senna: “Hína, mana castatya carien ment sie? Yé, ataretya yo inye nánet ñwalyaine, cestala tye!”
But he said to them: “What is your reason for seeking me? Did you not know that it is necessary for me to be in the house of my Father?”	Mal quentes túna: “Mana castasta cestien ni? Ma uaste sinte i mauya nin náve i coasse Atarinyava?”
But they did not understand the saying that he said to them.	Mal uatte hanyane i quetie ya quentes túna.
And he went down with them and came to Nazareth, and he heeded their commands. And his mother kept all these things in her heart.	Ar lendes undu asette ar túle Nasaretenna, ar cimnes canwattar. Ar amillerya hempe ilye nati sine endaryasse.
And Jesus went forward in wisdom and growth and grace among God and men.	Ar Yésus lende ompa mi sailie ar alie ar lisse mici Eru ar atani.
In the fifteenth year in which Tiberius ruled as High King , when Pontius Pilate was governor , and Herod ruled as farthing-ruler in Galilee, and Philip his brother ruled as farthing-ruler in the regions Iturea and Traconitis, and Lysenias was the farthing-ruler of Abilene,	I lepenquea loasse yasse Tivério turne ve Ingaran, íre Pontio Piláto náne nórecáno Yúreo, ar Herol turne ve canastatur mi Alilea, ar Filip hánorya turne ve canastatur mí ménar Ituréa ar Traconitis, ar Lisánias náne i canastatur Aviléneo,
while Annas and Caiaphas were chief priests, God's word came to John, Zechariah's son, in the wilderness.	íre Annas ar Caiafas náner hére airimor, Eruo quetta túle ana Yoháno Secarío yondo i ravandasse.
And he went to the entire region around Jordan, preaching baptism of repentance which gives forgivenes of sins,	Ar lendes i quanda ménanna os Yordan, nyardala tumyale inwistiéno ya anta apsenie úcariva,
as is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the Prophet: ”A voice that is crying in the wilderness: You prepare the Lord's way, make his paths straight!	ve ná técina i parmasse quettaron Yesaia i Erutercáno: “Óma queno ye yáma i ravandasse: Alde manwa i Heruo malle, cara tieryar tére!
Every gully will be filled, and every mountain and hill will be made flat, and the bends will be made straight paths and the humps smooth roads,	Ilya yáwe nauva quátina, ar ilya oron ar ambo nauva cárina lára, ar i lúvar nauvar cárine tére tieli ar i tumpur paste malleli,
and all flesh will see God's salvation.”	ar ilya hráve cenuva Eruo rehtie.”
Therefore he said to the crowds coming to be baptized by him: ”Children of serpents, who has told you how to escape from the coming wrath?	Etta quentes i şangannar ettúlala náven tumyaine lo sé: “A hínar leucoron, man anyárie len manen uşe i túlala rúşello?
Therefore produce fruits worthy of repentance. And do not begin to say to yourselves: 'As father we have Abraham.' For I say to you that God can rise children to Abraham from these stones.	Etta cara yávi valde inwisto. Ar áva yesta quete indenna: 'Ve atar samilve Avraham.' An quetin lenna i Eru pole orta híni Avrahámen sine sarnollon.
Indeed the axe even now lies by the root of the trees; therefore every tree that does not make good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.”	É i pelecco yando sí caita ara i aldaron şundo; etta ilya alda ye ua care mára yáve nauva círina undu ar hátina mir i náre.”
And the crowds asked him: ”Then what are we to do?”	Ar i şangar maquenter senna: “Tá mana caruvalme?”
In answer he said to them: “It is necessary for the man who has two tunics, to give one to the person that does not have, and it is necessary for who has things to eat to do the same.”	Hanquentasse quentes téna: “Mauya i neren ye same laupe atta, anta er i quenen ye ua same, ar mauya yen same natali matien care i imya.”
But also tax collectors came to be baptized, and they said to him: “Teacher, what are we to do?”	Mal yando tungwemóli túler náven tumyaine, ar quentelte senna: “Peantar, mana caruvalme?”
He said to them: “Do not demand money beyond the proper sum.”	Quentes téna: ”Áva cane telpe han i vanima nonwe.”
Furthermore, who worked in the army asked him: “What are we to do?” And he said to them: “Do not harass anyone, and do not speak lies about crimes that people have not committed, but let your payment suffice for you.”	Ente, i móler mí hosse maquenter senna: “Mana elme caruvar?” Ar quentes téna: “Áva tarasta aiquen, ar áva quete huruvi pa ongwi yar queni uar acárier, mal lava paityalelda farya len.”
Now the entire people looked forward to what would happen, and all thought in their heart about John: “Perhaps he is the Christ?”	Sí i quanda lie yente ompa yanna martumne, ar illi sanner endaltasse pa Yoháno: ”Cé sé i Hristo ná?”
John answered them: “I baptize you with water; but comes who is stronger than I; I am not worthy to loose the strap of his shoes . He will baptize you with Holy Spirit and with fire.	Yoháno hanquente illin: “Inye tumya le nennen; mal túla ye ná polda lá ni; inye ua valda lehtien hyaparyato latta. Le-tumyuvas Aire Feanen ar nárenen.
His winnowing fork is in his hand to cleanse his threshing floor, and he will gather his grain into the store, but the chaff he will burn with a fire that no one can extinguish.”	Saltamarya ea máryasse poitien vattarestarya, ar comyuvas orirya mir i haura, mal i ospor urtuvas nárenen ya úquen pole luhtya.”
Therefore he gave also many other urgings and preached the gospel to the people.	Etta antanes yando rimbe hyane hortiéli ar nyardane i evandilyon i lien.
But Herod the farthing-ruler, when he was rebuked by him concerning Herodias his brother's wife and concerning the wicked deeds that Herod did,	Mal Herol i canastantur, íre anes naityaina lo se pa Herólias hánoryo veri ar pa ilye i olce cardar yar Herol carne,
added also this thing to all those deeds: he put John in prison.	napanne yando nat sina ilye tane cardain: panyanes Yoháno mandosse.
Now when the whole people was baptized, also Jesus was baptized, and as he prayed, heaven was opened	Sí íre i quanda lie náne tumyaina, yando Yésus náne tumyaina, ar íre hyamnes, menel náne pantaina
and the Holy Spirit, in body-shape of a dove, came down upon him, and a voice came out of heaven: “You are my son, the beloved; of you I have thought well.”	ar i Aire Fea, hroacantasse cucuo, túle undu senna, ar óma túle et menello: “Elye ná yondonya, i melda; pa lyé asánien mai.”
And Jesus himself, at the beginning of his labor, had around thirty years. He was, one supposed, son of Joseph, son of Heli,	Ar Yésus immo, molieryo yestasse, sáme os loar nelequean. Anes, mo intyane, yondorya Yósef, yondorya Heli,

And Jesus, full of Holy Sprit, went away from Jordan and was led by the Spirit into the desert	Ar Yésus, quanta Aire Feo, lende oa Yordanello ar náne tulyaina lo i Faire mir i erume
for forty days, being tempted by the Devil. And he ate nothing in those days, and when they were gone, he was hungry.	aurin canaquean, nála şahtaina lo i Arauco. Ar mantes munta yane auressen, ar íre anelte vanwe, anes maita.
Then the Devil said to him: “If you are God's son, say to this stone: Be changed into bread!”	Tá i Arauco quente senna: “Qui nalye Eruo yondo, queta sar sinanna: Na vistaina mir massa!”
But Jesus answered him: “ is written: Man shall not have life by bread alone.”	Mal Yésus hanquente senna: “Ná técina: Atan ua samuva coire massanen erinqua.”
Then he led him up and showed him all the kingdoms of world in a single moment,	Tá se-tulyanes ama ar tanne sen ilye aranier ambaro mí erya lú,
and the Devil said to him: “I shall give you all this power and their glory, for it has been given to me, and I will give it to anyone that I wish.	ar i Arauco quente senna: “Antuvan lyen ilya túre sina ar alcarelta, an anaies antaina nin, ar antuvanyes aiquenen ye merin.
Therefore, if you worship me, everything shall be yours.”	Etta, qui elye tyere ní, ilqua nauva lyenya.”
In answer Jesus said to him: “ is written: The Lord your God you are to worship, and for him alone you are to serve.”	Hanquentasse Yésus quente senna: “Ná técina: I Héru Ainolya alye tyere, ar sen erinqua alye veuya.”
Now he led him into Jerusalem and put him on the wing of the temple and said to him: “If you are God's son, throw yourself down from here, for is written: He will command his angels concerning you, to keep you,	Sí se-tulyanes mir Yérusalem ar panyane i cordo rámasse ar quente senna: “Qui nalye Eruo yondo, hata imle undu silo, an ná técina: Canuvas valaryain pa lye, hepien lye,
and: They will carry you on their hands, to stop you from striking your foot against stone.”	ar: Coluvalte lye máltatse, pustien lye petiello talelya sarnenna.”
In answer Jesus said to him: “It is said: Do not test the Lord your God.”	Hanquentasse Yésus quente senna: “Ná quétina: Ávalye tyasta i Héru Ainolya.”
Then the Devil, after completing the entire temptation, went away from him until another time.	Tá i Arauco, apa telie i quanda úşahtie, lende oa sello tenna hyana lúme.
Now Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee. And good talk about him spread throughout the entire around-lying country.	Sí Yésus nanwenne i Faireo túresse mir Alilea. Ar mára quetie pa sé vintane ter i quanda oscaitala norie.
And he taught in their synagogues, receiving praise from all.	Ar peantanes yomencoaltassen, cámala laitale ho illi.
And he came to Nazareth, where he was raised, and as his habit was, he went into the synagogue, and he arose to read.	Ar túles Nasaretenna, yasse anes ortaina, ar ve haimerya náne, lendes mir i yomencoa, ar orontes hentien.
Then the scroll of Isaiah the Prophet was given to him, and he opened the book and found the place where was written:	Tá Isaia i Erutercáno toluparma náne antaina sen, ar pantanes i parma ar hirne i nóme yasse náne técina:
“The spirit of the Lord is on me, for he annointed me to give good news to poor ones; he sent me to make known to people in prison that they will be freed and to blind ones that they will receive sight, to send the broken ones away by a release,	“I Héruo faire ea nisse, an líves ni antien máre sinyali penyain; ni-mentanes carien sinwa quenin mandosse i nauvalte leryaine ar cénelórain i camuvalte céne, mentien i rácinar oa lehtiénen,
to make known the Lord's year of good will.”	carien sinwa i Héruo loa mára nirmeo.”
And he rolled up the book, gave it back to the servant and sat down; and the eyes of all that were in the synagogue were fixed on him.	Ar tolunes i parma, sa- nanantane i núron ar hamne undu; ar hendu illion i enger i yomencoasse nánet panyaine sesse.
Then he began to say to them: “Today this scripture has been made true while you heard it.”	Tá yestanes quete téna: “Síra tehtele sina anaie carna nanwa íre hlasseldes.”
And all witenssed about him, and they were in wonder about the gracious words that came out of his mouth, and they said: “Is this man not Joseph's son?”	Ar illi vettaner pa se, ar enger elmendasse pa i raine quettar yar túler et antoryallo, ar quentelte: “Ma nér sina ua Yósefo yondo?”
Then he said to them: “Indeed you want to say to me this proverb: Healer, heal yourself! The things that we have heard happened in Capernaum, do them also here in your own region!”	Tá quentes téna: “É merilde quete ninna &quenna sina: 'Nestando, á nesta imle! I nati yar ahlárielme martaner Capernaumesse, cara tai yando sisse véra ménalyasse!”
But he said: “Truly I say to you that there is not prophet that is well received in his own region.	Mal eques: “Násie quetin lenna i ua ea Erutercáno ye ná mai cámina véra ménaryasse.
For in truth I say to you: There were numerous widows in Israel in the days of Eliah, when heaven was shut for three years and six months, causing a great famine to fall upon the land;	An mi nanwie quetin lenna: Enger rimbe verulórali Israelde Elío auressen, íre menel náne holtaina ter loar nelde ar astari enque, tyárala túra saicele lanta i nórenna;
and yet Eliah was not sent to anyone among them, but to Zarephath in the land of Sidon, to a widowed woman there.	ananta Elía úne mentaina aiquenna mici té, mal Sarefatenna mi Sírono nóre, verulóra nissenna tasse.
Furthermore, were numerous skin-diseased ones in Israel at the time of Elisha the prophet, and yet no one among them was cleansed, but Naaman from Syria.”	Ente, enger rimbe helmahlaiwali Israelde Elíhya i Erutercáno lúmesse, ananta úquen mici té náne poitaina, mal Náman Siriallo.”
And all that heard these things in the synagogue were filled with rage,	Ar illi i hlasser nati sine i yomencoasse náner quátine ahanen,
and they arose and hurried him to the outside of the city, and their led him to the brow of the mountain on which their city was built, to throw him down from there.	ar orontelte ar se-hortaner i osto ettenna, ar tulyaneltes lancanna i oronto yasse ostolta náne carastaina, hatien se undu talo.
But he walked through their midst and went away.	Mal sé menne ter endelta ar lende oa.
And he went down to Capernaum, a city in Galilee. And he taught them on the day of rest,	Ar lendes undu Caparnaumenna, osto Alileasse. Ar peantanes tien i sendaresse,
and they were filled with wonder by the manner that he taught, for his speech had power.	ar anelte quátine elmendo i lénen ya peantanes, an quetierya sáme túre.
And was in the synagoge a man possessed by a spirit, an unclean demon, and it cried with a mighty voice:	Ar enge i yomencoasse nér haryaina lo faire, úpoica rauco, ar yámes taura ómanen:
“Ah! What there to us and to you , Jesus from Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are, the Holy One of God!”	“Ai! Mana men ar lyen, Yésus Nasaretello? Ma utúliel nancarien me? Istan man nalye, Eruo Aire!”
And Jesus rebuked it, saying: “Be silent and come out of him!” And after throwing the man down in their midst, the demon came out of him, without hurting him.	Ar Yésus naityane se, quétala: “Na quilda ar tula et sello!” Ar apa hatie i nér undu endeltasse, i rauco túle et sello, ú maliéno se.
Then wonder fell upon all, and they talked one with the other, saying: “What kind of speech is this? For with power and with might he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out!”	Tá elmenda lantane illinnar, ar carampelte quén as i exe, quétala: “Mana nostale quetiéno ná si? An túrenen ar melehtenen canis i úpoice fairi, ar ettulilte!”
And the news about him went out in every place in the around-lying country.	Ar i sinyar pa se etelender mir ilya nóme i oscaitala noriesse.
After leaving the synagoge he went into the house of Simon. But Simon's wife's mother was troubled by a great fever , and they made petition to him about her.	Apa autie i yomencoallo lendes mir coarya Símon. Mal Símondo verio amil náne tarastaina túra úrenen, ar carnelte arcande sen pa sé.
And he stood above the woman and rebuked the fever, and that went away from her. In the same moment she arose and served for them.	Ar tarnes or i nís ar naityane i úre, ar ta oante sello. Mí imya lú orontes ar veuyane tien.
But at the setting of the sun, all that had people sick with various illnesses brought them to him. By putting his hands on them he healed them.	Mal Anaro nútiesse, illi i sámer queni hlaiwe alavéle hlívelínen taller te senna. Paniénen máryat tesse nestanes te.
Furthermore, demons came out from numerous ones, crying and saying: “You are God's son.” But he rebuked them and did not allow them to speak, since they knew that he was the Christ.	Ente, raucoli ettúler rimbalillon, yámala ar quétala: “Elye ná Eruo yondo.” Mal naityanes te ar ua láve tien quete, pan sintelte i anes i Hristo.
But when day came, he went out and went to a lonely place. But the crowds sought him, and they came to where he was, and they tried to stop him from going away from them.	Ono íre aure túle, etelendes ar menne eressea nómenna. Mal i şangar cestaner se, ar túlelte yanna anes, ar névelte pusta se autiello tello.
But he said to them: “Also to the other cities it is necessary for me to make known the gospel, for that is the reason why I was sent forth.”	Mal quentes téna: “Yando i hyane ostoin mauya nin care sinwa i evandilyon, an ta ná i casta yanen anen etementaina.”
And he went preaching in the synagogues of Judea.	Ar lendes nyardala Yúreo yomencoassen.
At an occasion when the crowd pressed against him, listening to God's word, he stood by the lake Gennesaret.	Mi lú yasse i şanga ninde senna, lastala Eruo quettanna, tarnes ara i ailin Ennesaret.
And he saw two boats lying by the lake, but the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing their nets.	Ar cennes lunte atta caitala ara i ailin, mal i lingwimor náner ménienwe et tullo ar náner sóvala rembeltar.
Going into one of the boats, which was Simon's, he asked him to go a short distance from the land. Then he sat down, and from the boat he taught the crowds.When he ceased to speak, he said to Simon: “Go to where it is deep, and you put down your nets for a catch.”	Lelyala mir er i luntion, ya náne Símonwa, arcanes sello lelya şinta tie i norello. Tá hamnes undu, ar i luntello peantanes i şangain.Íre pustanes quete, quentes Símonna: “Á lelya yanna núra ná, ar alde panya undu rembeldar mapien.”
But in answer Simon said: “Teacher, throughout the entire night we have toiled and caught nothing, but at your order I will put the nets down.”	Mal hanquentasse Símon quente: “Peantar, ter i quanda lóme omótielme ar namper munta, mal canwalyanen panyuvan i rembeltar undu.”
When they did so, they enclosed a great multitude of fishes, and their nets were torn.	Íre carnelte sie, yórelte hoa rimbe lingwilíva, ar rembeltar náner narcaine.
And they gestured to their partners in the other boat for them to come to help them, and they came, and they filled both boats, until they were going down.	Ar hwernelte rantarwaltain i hyana luntesse tulieltan manien tien, ar túlelte, ar quantelte yúyo lunte, tenna anette nútala.
When he saw that, Simon Peter fell down before Jesus' knees, saying: “Go away from me, for I am a sinful man, Lord!”	Íre cennes ta, Símon Péter lantane undu epe Yésuo occat, quétala: “Á auta nillo, an nanye úcarunqua nér, Heru!”
For by the catch of fishes he was struck with wonder, he and all that were with him,	An i mapiénen lingwilíva anes pétina elmendanen, sé ar illi i náner óse,
and also both Jacob and John, the sons of Zebedee, that were partners with Simon. But Jesus said to Simon: “Do not be afraid! From now you will catch men alive.”	ar yando yúyo Yácov yo Yoháno, yondoryar Severai, i nánet rantarwali as Símon. Mal Yésus quente Símonna: “Áva ruce! Ho sí mapuval atalli coirie.”
And they brought the boats to land and abandoned everything and followed him.	Ar tulunelte i lunti norenna ar hehtaner ilqua ar hilyaner sé.
And when he was in one of the cities, behold! a man full of skin-disease. When he saw Jesus he fell upon his face and begged of him, saying: “Lord, if you want to, you can cleanse me!”	Ar íre anes mi er i ostoron, yé! nér quanta helmahlíveo. Íre cennes Yésus lantanes cendeleryanna ar inque sello, quétala: “Heru, qui meril, polil poita ni!”
And reaching out with his hand Jesus touched him, saying: “I want to! Be cleansed!” And in the same moment the skin-disease disappeared from him.	Ar eterahtala máryanen Yésus se-appane, quétala: “Merin! Na poitaina!” Ar mí imya lú i helmahlíve váne sello.
And he commanded the man: “Tell nobody, but go away and show yourself to the priest, and as Moses commended made a sacrifice for your cleansing, as a witness to them.”	Ar cannes i neren: “Nyara uquenen, mal á auta ar tana imle i airimon, ar ve Móses canne cara yanca poitielyan, ve vettie tien.”
But the word about him scattered that much more, and great crowds came together to listen and to be healed from their sicknesses.	Mal i quetta pa se vintane ta ita ambe, ar hoe şangali túler uo lastien ar náven nestaine hlíveltallon.
But he went away into the deserts, praying.	Ono lendes oa mir i erumi, hyámala.
It happened in a day that he was teaching, and some Pharisees and teachers of the Law that had come from every village of Galilee and of Judea and of Jerusalem sat there, and the Lord's power was there, for him to be able to heal.	Martane mi aure i anes peantala, ar Farisali ar peantalli i Şanyeo i náner túlienwe et ilya mastollo Alileo ar Yúreo ar Yerúsalémo hamner tasse, ar i Héruo túre náne tasse, polieryan nesta.
And behold! some people bearing on a bed a man that was lame, and they sought to bring him forward and put him before Jesus.	Ar yé! quelli cólala caimasse nér ye náne úlévima, ar cestanelte tala se ompa ar panya se epe Yésus.
But when they did not find how they could carry him forward, by reason of the crowd, they climbed to the roof, and through the thatch they let him down with the bed, in the middle before Jesus.	Mal íre ualte hirne manen pollelte cole se ompa, castanen i şango, rentelte i tópanna, ar ter i tupse panyaneltes undu as i caima, i endesse epe Yésus.
And when he saw their faith he said: “Man, your sins are forgiven you!”	Ar íre cennes savielta quentes: “Atan, úcarelyar nar apsénine lyen!”
And the scribes an the Pharisees started to think, saying: “Who is this man that is speaking blasphemies? Who may forgive sins except God alone?”	Ar i parmangolmor ar i Farisar yestaner sana, quétala: “Man ná nér sina ye quéta naiquetiéli? Man lerta apsene úcari hequa Eru erinqua?”
But Jesus, perceiving their thoughts, said in answer to them: “About what are you thinking in your hearts?	Mal Yésus, tuntala sanweltar, quenter hanquentasse téna: “Pa mana sánealde endaldassen?
What is the more easily done, saying 'Your sins are forgiven to you' or saying: “Rise, take your bed and go to your house.'	Mana i ambe ascare: quetie 'Úcarelyar nar apsénine lyen' hya quetie: 'Á orta, mapa caimalya ar mena coalyanna.'
But for you to know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins” – he said to the lame man: “I say to you, rise and take up your bed and go to your house.”	Mal istieldan i same i Atanyondo túre cemende apsenien úcari –” quentes i úlévima nerenna: “Quetin lyenna, á orta ar mapa ama caimalya ar mena coalyanna.”
And in the same moment he arose before them, took up that on which he lay, and went to his house giving glory to God.	Ar mi imya lú orontes epe te, nampe ama ta yasse yá caines, ar lende coaryanna antala alcar Erun.
Then all among them were beside themselves, and they gave glory to God and were filled with fear, saying: “We have seen wonders today!”	Tá illi mici te náner ara inte, ar antanelte alcar Erun ar náner quátine caureo, quétala: “Ecénielve elmendali síra!”
And after these things he went forth and saw a tax-collector called Levi sitting at the tax office, and he said to him: “Follow me.”	Ar apa nati sine etelendes ar cenne tungwemo estaina Lévi hámala mí tungwemen, ar quentes senna: “Áni hilya.”
And abandoning everything he arose and followed him.	Ar hehtala ilqua orontes and hilyane se.
Furthermore, Levi made a great feast for him at his house, and was a great crowd, tax collectors and others, that were with them at the table.	Ente, Lévi carne túra merende sen coaryasse, ar enge hoa şanga, tungwemóli ar exeli, i náner aselte ara i sarno.
And the Pharisees and their scribes grumbled against his disciples, saying: “How is that you eat and you drink with tax collectors and sinners?”	Ar i Farisar ar parmangolmoltar nurruner hildoryannar, quétala: “Manen ná i matilde ar sucilde as tungwemóli ar úcarindoli?”
In answer Jesus said to them: “ that have health do not have need of a healer, but that are sickly.	Hanquentasse Yésus quente téna: “I samir mále uar same maure nestondova, mal i nar engwe.
I have come to call, not just ones, but sinners to repentence.”	Utúlien yale, lá failar, mal úcarindor inwistenna.”
They said to him: “John's discipels frequently fast and make supplications, but your ones eat and drink.”	Quentelte senna: “Hildoryar Yoháno rimbave avamatir ar carir arcandeli, mal lyenyar matir ar sucir.”
Jesus said to them: “Surely you cannot compel the bridegroom's friends to fast when the bridegroom is with them? And yet days shall come in which the bridegroom will be taken away from them; then they shall fast, in those days.	Yésus quente téna: “Lau polilde mauya i endero meldoin avamate íre i ender ea aselte? Ananta aureli tuluvar yassen i ender nauva mapaina oa tello; tá avamatuvalte, ente auressen.”
Furthermore, he spoke this comparison: “No one cuts a cloth-piece from a new cloak and sews it in an old cloak, but if one indeed does so, then the new cloth-piece tears away; furthermore, the cloth-piece from the new cloak is not similar to the old.	Ente, quentes téna sestie: “Úquen cire lanneranta ho vinya colla ar neme sa yára collasse, mal qui mo é care sie, tá i vinya lanneranta narca oa; ente, i lanneranta ho i vinya colla ua vávea i yáran.
And no one puts new wine in old skin-bottles, but if one indeed does so, then the new wine bursts the skin-bottles, and it flows out and the skin-bottles are destroyed.	Ar úquen panya vinya limpe yáre helmolpessen, mal qui mo é care sie, tá i vinya limpe ruve i helmolpi, ar ulyas ettenna ar i helmolpi nar nancarne.
But it is necessary to put new wine in new skin-bottles!	Mal mauya panya vinya limpe vinye helmolpessen!
No one who has drunk old wine wants new, for he says: 'The old is good.'”	Úquen ye usúcie yára limpe mere vinya, an quetis: 'I yára ná mára.'”
It happened on a day of restthat he went through some grain-fields , and his disciples picked and ate the heads of grain, crushing them in their hand.	Túle sendaresse i lendes ter orirestali, ar hilmoryar leptaner ar manter i cari oriva, ascátala tai máltatse.
But some of the Pharisees said: “How is that you are doing what is not allowed on the day of rest?”	Mal quelli i Farisaron quenter: “Manen ná i cáralde ya ua lávina i sendaresse?”
But Jesus answered them: “Have you not ever read about that which David did when he and the men with him were hungry?	Mal Yésus hanquente téna: “Ma ualde oi ehentie pa ya Lavir carne íre sé ar i neri óse náner maite?
He went into God's house and received the breads of presentation and ate and gave them to the men with him, though they are not permitted food for anyone except for the priests alone.”	Lendes mir i coa Eruva ar camne i mastar taniéva ar mante ar antane tai i nerin óse, ómu tai uar lávina matso aiquenen hequa i airimoin erinque.”
And he said to them: “The Son of Man is Lord of the day of rest.”	Ar quentes téna: “I Atanyondo ná Heru i sendareo.”
It happened on another day of rest taht he went into the synagogue and taught. And was there a man whose right hand was withered.	Túle hyana sendaresse i lendes mir i yomencoa ar peantane. Ar enge tasse nér yeo forma náne hessa.
The scribes and the Pharisees watched him, to see if he was going to heal anyone on the day of rest, for them to find a way with which they could accuse him.	I parmangolmor ar i Farisar tirner se, cenien qui nestumne aiquen i sendaresse, hirieltan lé yanen pollelte ulquete se.
But he knew how they thought, and yet he said to the man having the withered hand: “Rise and stand in the middle.” And he arose and stood there.	Mal sintes manen sannelte, ananta quentes i nerenna arwa i hessa máo: “Á orta ar tara i endesse.” Ar orontes ar tarne tasse.
Then Jesus said to them: “I ask of you: Is it allowed on the day of rest to do good or to do evil, to save a person or to destroy him?”	Tá Yésus quente téna: “Maquetin lello: Ma ná lávina i sendaresse care márie hya care ulco, rehta quén hya nancare se?”
And after he looked at all among them, from person to person, he said to the man: “Reach out with your hand!” He did so, and his hand was healed.	Ar apa yentes illi mici te, quenello quenenna, quentes i nerenna: “Á rahta mályanen!” Carnes sie, ar márya náne envinyanta.
But they were filled with rage, and spoke about what they were going to do to Jesus.	Mal anelte quátine urşanen, ar quentelte pa mana carumnelte Yésun.
It happened in those days that he went up into the mountain to pray, and he remained there through the night, in prayer to God	Túle ente auressen i lendes ama mir i oron hyamien, ar lemnes tasse ter i lóme, hyamiesse Erunna.
But when day came, he summoned his disciples and chose from among them twelve, that he also named apostles:	Mal íre aure túle, yalles hildoryar ar ciller ho mici te yunque, i yando estanes aposteli:
Simon, whom he also called Peter, and Andrew his brother, and Jacob and John, and Phillip and Bartholomew	Símon, ye yando estanes Péter, ar Andréo hánorya, ar Yácov and Yoháno, ar Filip ar Varşoloméo
and Matthew and Thomas and Jacob the son of Alphaeus, and Simon who is called the Zealot,	ar Mattéo ar Şomas ar Yácov yondorya Alfaio, ar Símon ye ná estaina i Selot,
and Judah son of Jacob, and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.	ar Yúra yondorya Yácov, ar Yúras Iscariot, ye vartane se.
And he came down with them and stood on a plain, and was a multitude of people from all of Judea and Jerusalemn and from the sea-regions arbout Tyre and Sidon, that came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases.	Ar túles undu aselte ar tarne palaresse, ar enge hoa liyúme queniva ho i quanda Yúrea ar Yerúsalem ar ho i earménar os Tír ar Siron, i túler hlarien se ar náven nestaine hlíveltaron.
Also that were tormented by unclean spirits were healed.	Yando i náner tarastaine lo úpoice faireli náner nestaine.
And the whole crowd sought to touch him, for power went out of him and healed all among them.	Ar i quanda şanga cestaner appa se, an túre lende et sello ar nestane illi mici te.
And he raised his eyes towards his disciples and said: “Happy are the poor, for God's kingdom is yours!	Ar ortanes henduryat hilmoryannar ar quente: “Valime nar i penyar, an Eruo aranie ná lenya!
Happy are you that are hungry now, for you will be filled!Happy are you that are wailing, for you will laugh!	Valime nar elde i nar maite sí, an nauvalde quátine!Valime nar elde i nar yaimie, an laluvalde!
Happy you are when men hate you, and when they turn from you and abuse you and throw out your name as evil, for the good of the Son of Man.	Valima nalde íre atani tevir le, ar íre queriltexer lello ar naityar le ar et-hatir esselda ve ulca, i Atanyondo márien.
Have joy in that day and leap, for behold! your reward is great in heaven. For those are the same things that their fathers did to the prophets.	Sama alasse aure entasse ar capa, an yé! paityalelda ná túra menelde. An tai nar i imye nati yar atariltar carner i Erutercánoin.
But woe to you that are rich, for you have received your entire comfort!	Mal horro len i nar lárie, an asámielde quanda tiutalelda!
Woe to you that are full now, for you will be hungry!Woe to you that laugh now, for you will have grief and tears!	Horro len i nar quátine sí, an nauvalde maite!Horro len i lalar sí, an samuvalde nyére ar níri!
Woe to you when all men speak well of you, for in the same manner their fathers spoke about the false prophets!	Horro len íre ilye atani quetir mai pa le, an mí imya lé atariltar quenter pa i úanwe Erutercánor!
But I say to you that listen: Love your enemies and do well to that hate you,	Mal quetin lenna i lastar: Mela ñottoldar ar cara mai in tevir le,
bless that curse you and pray for who speak evil about you.	á aista i hútar le ar hyama in quetir ulco pa le.
Towards that strikes you on one chin turn also the other, and that takes your cloak do not stop from taking also the tunic.	Yenna pete le er ventasse quera yando i exe, ar ye mapa collalya áva pusta mapiello yando i laupe.
Give to all that ask of you , and from that takes your things, do not ask to receive them back.	Á anta illin i arcar lyello, ar yello mapa natilyar áva arca nancame tai.
And as you wish that men will do to you, so do to them.	Ar ve merilde i atani caruvar len, sie cara tien.
And if you love that love you, how will that be beneficial for you? For also the sinners love that love them.	Ar qui melilde i melir lé, manen ta nauva aşea len? An yando i úcarindor melir i melir té.
And if you do good to that do good to you, how will that be beneficial for you? Also the sinners do the same.	Ar qui carilde márie in carir márie elden, manen ta nauva aşea len? Yando i úcarindor carir i imya.
And if you lend to people from whom you have hope of receiving, how will that be beneficial to you? Also sinners lend to sinners in order to receive back the same sum.	Ar qui yutyal queni illon samil estel camiéva, manen ta nauva aşea len? Yando úcarindor yutyar úcarindor nancamien i imya nonwa.
On the contrary, love your enemies and do good and lend to others, without hope of receiving back, and your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High, for he is kind to who do not give thanks and to the evil ones.	Úsie, mela ñottoldar ar cara márie ar á yutya exeli, ú estelo nancamiéva, ar paityalelda nauva túra, ar nauvalde i Antaro yondor, an sé ná aşea in uar anta hantale ar i ulcain.
Show mercy like your Father shows mercy!	Á órava ve Atarelda órava!
Furthermore, do not judge, and you will by no means be judged; do not say that others are worthy of punishment, and will not be said about you that you are worthy of punishment. Release, and you will be released.	Ente, áva name, ar laume nauvalde námine; áva quete i exi nar valde paimeo, ar ua nauva quétina pa lé i nalde valde paimeo. Á lehta, ar nauvalde lehtaine.
Give, and one will give to you. A good measure – pressed down, shaken and abundant – they will place in your bosom. For by the measure with which you measure out, they will measure out to you.	Á anta, ar mo antuva len. Mára lesta – nírina undu, pálina ar úvea – panyuvalte súmaldasse. An i lestanen yanen etelestalde, etelestuvalte len.
Then he also spoke this comparison: “Surely a blind person cannot lead a blind person? Will not both fall into a hollow?	Tá yando quentes sestie téna: “Lau cénelóra quén pole tulya cénelóra quén? Ma yúyo uat lantuva mir unque?
 who learns is not above who instructs, but everyone that has been fully instructed will be like who instructs.	Ye pare ua or ye peanta, mal ilquen yen anaie aqua peantaina nauva ve ye peanta.
How is , then, that you look at the straw which is in your brother's eye, but you do not heed the plank which is in your own eye?	Manen ná, tá, i yétal i lisce ya ea hánolyo hendesse, mal ualye cime i pano ya ea véra hendelyasse?
How is it possible for you to say to your brother: 'Brother, allow me to take the straw out of your eye,' when you do not look at the plank in your own eye?	Manen ece lyen quete hánolyanna: 'Háno, lava nin mapa i lisce et hendelyallo,' íre elye ua yéta i pano véra hendelyasse?
For does not exist good tree producing foul fruit; again does not exist foul tree producing good fruit.	An ua ea mára alda cárala şaura yáve; ata ua ea şaura alda cárala mára yáve.
For every tree is known by its fruit. For people do not gather figs from thorns; furthermore, they do not cut grapes from a thorn-bush.	An ilya alda ná sinwa yáveryanen. An queni uar hosta rélyávi necelillon; ente, ualte cire tiumar ho neceltussa.
A good man brings good out of his heart's hidden treasure, but an evil man brings evil out of his evil treasure, for out of the heart's abundance his mouth speaks.	Mára atan tala márie et endaryo mára harmallo, mal ulca atan tala ulco et ulca harmaryallo, an et i endo úvello antorya quete.
How is that you call me 'Lord, Lord', and yet you do not do the things that I say?	Manen ná i estalde ni 'Heru, Heru', ananta ualde care i nati yar quetin?
Everyone who comes to me and hears my words and does them – I will show you with whom one can compare him:	Ilquen ye tule ninna ar hlare quettanyar ar care tai – tanuvan len as man mo pole sesta se:
He is like a person building a house, who dug and put the foundation upon the rock. Therefore, when was flood, the river beat against that house, but it could not shake it, since it was well built.	Náse ve quén carastala coa, ye sampe ar panyane i talma i ondosse. Etta, íre enge oloire, i síre palpane sana coanna, mal uas polle pale sa, pan anes mai carastaina.
But who has heard and does not do, is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation. Against it the river beat, and in that moment it collapsed, and the collapse of that house was great.”	Mal ye ahlárie ar ua care, ná ve nér ye carastane coa i talamesse ú talmo. Sanna i síre pente, ar mí tana lú talantes, ar coa tano atalantie náne túra.”
After he completed all his sayings while the people listened, he went into Capernaum.	Apa telyanes ilye quetieryar íre i lie lastane, lendes mir Capernaum.
But the slave of a centurion, who was dear to him, was ailing and near to expiring.	Mal tuxanturo mól, ye náne melda sen, náne nimpa ar hare effírienna.
When he heard about Jesus, he sent to him some elders of the Jews to request him to come and to deliver his slave.	Íre hlasses pa Yésus, mentanes senna amyárali i Yúraron arcien sello tule ar etelehta mólya.
Then that came to Jesus made petition of him and said: “He is worthy that you do this thing for him,	Tá i túler Yésunna carner arcande sello ar quenter: “Náse valda i caril nat sina sen,
for he loves our nation, and he built for us the synagoge.”	an melis nórelva, ar sé carastane men i yomencoa.”
And Jesus went with them. But when he was not far from the house, the centurion beforehand sent some friends for them to say to him: “Lord, do not trouble yourself, for I am not worthy that you come under my roof.	Ar Yésus lende aselte. Mal íre únes haira i coallo, i tuxantur nóvo mentane meldoli quetieltan senna: “Heru, áva tarasta imle, an uan valda i tulil nu tópanya.
Therefore I did not count myself worthy to come to you. But say the word and cause my slave to be healed.	Etta únen note imne valda tulien lyenna. Mal queta i quetta ar tyara mólinya náve nestaina.
For I as well am a man under authority , having soldiers under me, and if I say to this one: Go! – then he goes, or to another: Come! – then he comes, or to my slave: Do so! – then he does that.”	An yando inye ná nér nu túre, arwa ohtallion nu ni, ar qui quetin sinanna: Mena! – tá ménas, hya exenna: Tula! – tá tulis, hya mólinyanna: Cara sie! – tá caris ta.”
And when Jesus heard these things he was filled with wonder about him, and he turned to the crowd following him and said: “I tell you, even in Israel I have not found a faith that great.”	Ar íre Yésus hlasse nati sine anes quátina elmendanen pa se, ar quernes inse i şanganna hilyala se ar quente: “Nyarin len, yando Israelde uan ihírie savie ta túra.”
And that were sent, when they returned to the house, found the slave in health.	Ar i náner mentaine, íre nanwennelte i coanna, hirner i mól málesse.
And thereafter happened that he went into a city called Nain, and his disciples and a great crowd went with him.	Ar epeta martane i lendes mir osto estaina Nain, ar hildoryar ar hoa şanga lender óse.
And when he came near to the gate of the city, a dead man was carried outside, the only-born son of his mother. Furthermore, her husband was dead. A great crowd from the city was also with the woman.	Ar íre túles hare i osto andonna, qualin nér náne cólina ettenna, amilleryo ernóna yondo. Ente, verurya náne qualin. Hoa şanga i ostollo enge yando as i nís.
And when the Lord saw her, his heart went out to her, and he said to her: “Do not be wailing!”	Ar íre i Heru cenne se, endarya etelende senna, ar quentes senna: “Áva na yaimea!”
And having come near he touched the bier, and the bearers stopped, and he said: “Young man, I say to you: Rise!”	Ar túlienwa hare appanes i tulma, ar i colindor pustaner, ar quentes: “Nessa nér, quetin lyenna: Á orta!”
And the dead man sat up and started to talk, and Jesus gave him to his mother.	Ar i qualin nér hamne ama ar yestane carpa, ar Yésus se-antane amilleryan.
Now fear seized them all, and they gave glory to God, saying: “A great prophet has been raised up among us,” and: “God has heeded his people!”	Sí rucie nampe te illi, ar antanelte alcar Erun, quétala: “Túra Erutercáno anaie ortaina ama mici ve,” ar: “Eru icímie lierya!”
And this word spread into all Judea and the whole around-lying country.	Ar quetta sina vistane mir quanda Yúrea ar i quanda oscaitala nórienna.
And John's disciples told him about all these things.	Ar Yoháno hildor nyarner sen pa ilye nati sine.
And John called two of his disciples and sent them to the Lord to say: “Are you that was going to come, or is it necessary for us to look forward to another?”	Ar Yoháno yalle atta hildoryaron ar mentane tu i Herunna quetien: “Ma elye ná ye tulumne, hya ma mauya men yéta ompa exenna?”
When they came to him, the men said: “John the Baptist sent us to you to say: Are you that was going to come, or is it necessary for us to look forward to another?”	Íre túlette senna, i neri quenter: “Yoháno i Tumyando mentane met lyenna quetien: Ma elye ná ye tulumne, hya ma mauya men yéta ompa exenna?”
In that hour he healed numerous ones, freeing them from illnesses and from sufferings and from wicked spirits, and many blind ones he caused to see.	Lúme yanasse nestanes rimbali, leryala te hlívellon ar perperiellon ar olce fairellon, ar rimbe cénelóralin tyarnes céne.
And he answered them : “Go away, tell John what you saw and heard: The blind receive sight, the skin-diseased are made clean and that lacked hearing hear, the dead ones are raised, and happy is that does not find in me a cause for falling.”	Ar hanquentes túna: “Á auta, nyara Yohánon ya cennette ar hlassette: I cénelórar camir céne, i helmahlaiwar nar poitaine ar i penner hlarie hlarir, i qualini nar ortaine, ar valima ná ye ua hire nisse casta taltiéva.”
After the men send by John went away, he began to speak to the crowds about John: “What did you go into the desert to look at? A reed moving by the wind?	Apa i neri mentaine lo Yoháno oanter, yestanes carpa i şangannar pa Yoháno: “Mana lendelde mir i erume yétien? Lisce lévala i şúrinen?
No, what did you go out to see? A man having soft clothes? Behold, those having soft clothes are in the houses of kings!	Lá, mana etelendelde cenien? Nér arwa mussi lannion? Yé, i arwar mussi lannion ear coassen araniva!
But what your reason for going out? To see a prophet? Yes, I say to you, and much more than a prophet!	Mal mana castalda etelelien? Cenie Erutercáno? Ná, quetin lenna, ar ambela Erutercáno!
He was about whom it has been written: 'Behold! I send my herald before your face, to prepare your way before you.'	Sé náne pa ye anaie técina: 'Yé! Mentan tercánonya epe cendelelya, manwien mallelya epe lye.'
I tell you: Among that were born of women is no one greater than John, but a person among the smaller in God's kingdom is greater than he.”	Nyarin len: Imíca i náner nóne lo nissi ea úquen túra lá Yoháno, mal quén imíca i ambe pityar Eruo araniesse ná túra lá sé.”
And the whole people and the tax collectors, when they heard that, said that God was just, they being baptized with John's baptism. But the Pharisees and the lawyers turned away which God wanted for them, they that were not baptized by him.	Ar i quanda lie ar i tungwemor, íre hlasselte ta, quenter i Eru náne faila, té nála tumyaine Yoháno tumyalénen. Mal i Farisar ar i şanyengolmor querner oa ya Eru merne tien, té i úner tumyaine lo sé.
“With whom, then, shall I compare this generation?	“As man, tá, sestuvan nónare sina?
They are like children sitting in a market-place and crying one to the other: 'We played the flute for you, but you did not dance; we were wailing, but you did not have tears.'	Nalte ve hínar hámala mi mancanóme ar yámala quén i exenna: 'Tyallelme i simpa len, mal ualde liltane; anelme yaimie, mal ualde sáme níri.'
For John the Baptist has come, not eating bread or drinking vine, but you say: He is possessed by a demon!	An Yoháno i Tumyando utúlie, lá mátala massa hya súcala limpe, mal quetilde: 'Náse haryaina lo rauco!'
The Son of Man has come, eating and drinking, but you say: Look! A man over-eating and given to drinking vine, friend of tax collectors and sinners!'	I Atanyondo utúlie, mátala ar súcala, mal quetilde: 'Ela! Nér accamátala ar antaina sucien limpe, meldo tungwemoron ar úcarindoron!'
And yet wisdom is shown just by all its children.”	Ananta sailie ná tanaina faila lo ilye hínaryar.”
A person among the Pharisees requested that Jesus was to eat with him, and coming into the Pharisee's house he laid down by the table.	Quén imíca i Farisar arcane i Yésus matumne óse, ar túlala mir coa i Farisava caines undu ara i sarno.
And behold! a woman who was known in the city as a sinner learnt that he was at the table in the house of the Pharisees, and she bought a stone-box of fragrant oil,	Ar yé! nís ye náne sinwa i ostosse ve úcarinde parne i enges ara i sarno coasse i Farisava, ar mancanes insen ondocolca níşima milleo,
and standing in tears behind Jesus by his feet, the woman started to make his feet wet with her tears and wiped them off with the hair of her head, and she kissed his feet and annointed them with the fragrant oil.	ar tárala níressen ca Yésus ara talyat, i nís yestane care talyat mixe níreryainen ar aupsarne tai caryo findelénen, ar minques talyat ar líve tu i níşima millonen.
Seeing that, the Pharisee who invited Jesus said to himself: “This man, if he was a prophet, would know who and of what kind is this woman that is touching him – that she is a sinner!”	Cénala ta, i Farisa ye yalle Yésus quente insenna: “Nér sina, qui anes Erutercáno, istumne man ar mana nostaleo ná nís sina ye appea se – i náse úcarinde!”
But in answer Jesus said to him: “Simon, I have something that I want to say to you.” He said: “Teacher, say it!”	Mal hanquentasse Yésus quente senna: “Símon, samin nat ya merin quete lyenna.” Eques: “Peantar, queta sa!”
“Two men had a debt to a person from whom they received money; one had a debt of five hundred denarii, the other, fifty.	“Nér atta sámet rohta quenen yello camnette telpe; er sáme rohta lenárion tuxar lempe, i exe, lepenquean.
When they had nothing to give back to him, he foregave both. Then who among them will love him more?”	Íre sámelte munta nanantien sen, yúyon apsennes. Tá man mici tú meluva se ambe?”
In answer Simon said: “I suppose the person to whom he forgave the greatest sum.” He said to him: “You judged well.”	Hanquentasse Símon quente: “Intyan i quén yenen apsennes i anhoa nonwe.” Quentes senna: “Namnes mai.”
Then he turned to the woman and said to Simon: “Are you seeing this woman? I came into your house; you did not give me water for my feet. But this woman made my feet wet with her tears and wiped them away with her hair.	Tá quernes inse i nissenna ar quente Símondenna: “Ma cénal nís sina? Túlen mir coalya; ual antane nin nén talunyant. Mal nís sina carne talunyat mixe níreryainen ar aupsarne tai findeleryanen.
You did not give me kiss, but this woman, from the hour that I came, did not cease to kiss my feet.	Ual antane nin mique, mal nís sina, i lúmello ya túlen, ua pustane mique talunyat.
You did not anoint my head with oil, but this woman anointed my feet with fragrant oil.	Ual líve carinya millonen, mal nís sina líve talunyat níşima millonen.
For this reason I say to you: Her numerous sins are forgiven her, for she loved much; but to whom a little is forgiven, loves little.”	Sina castanen quetin lyenna: Rímbe úcareryar nar apsénine sen, an méles ole; mal yen pitya ná apsénina, mele pityave.”
Then he said to her: “Your sins are forgiven.”	Tá quentes senna: “Úcarelyar nar apsénine.”
But those who lay with him at the table began to say in themselves: “Who is this man that also forgives sins?”	Mal i cainer óse as i sarno yestaner quete intesse: “Man ná nér sina ye yando apsene úcari?”
But he said to the woman: “Your faith has saved you; go in peace.”	Ono quentes i nissenna: “Savielya erehtie lye; mena rainesse.”
And it happened thereafter that he went from city to city and from village to vilalge and taught and made known the gospel about God's kingdom, and the twelve followed him, as did some women that were healed from wicked spirit and illneses: Mary who was called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out,	Ar túle epeta i lendes ostollo ostonna ar mastollo mastonna ar peantane ar carne sinwa i evandilyon pa Eruo aranie, ar i yunque hilyaner se, ve carner nisseli i náner nestaine olce fairellon ar hlívellon: María ye náne estaina Mahtaléne, yello raucor otso náner ettúlienwe,
and Joanna the wife of Cuza, Herod's commander, and Susanna and numerous other women, who served him with their goods.	ar Yoanna verirya Cúsa, Herolo cáno, ar Susanna ar rimbe hyane nisseli, i veuyaner sen armaltainen.
Now when a great crowd had gathered with that went with him from city to city, he said to them in a comparison:	Sí íre hoa şanga náne ocómienwa as i lender óse ostollo ostonna, quentes téna sestiénen:
“A sower went out to sow. In his sowing some seeds fell beside the road and were trampled down, and the birds of heaven ate them.	“Rerindo etelende rerien. Rerieryasse erdeli lantaner ara i malle ar náne vattaina undu, ar menelo aiwi manter tai.
Others fell upon the rock, and after they sprouted they withered, for lacking water.	Exeli lantaner i ondonna, ar apa tuianelte hestanelte, peniénen nén.
Others fell among the thorns, and the thorns that grew up with them choked them.	Exeli lantaner imíca i neceli, ar i neceli i aller ama aselte quorner te.
Others fell upon the good soil, and after they sprouted they made fruit, a hundred added measures.” After telling these things, he cried: “May that has ears hear!”	Exeli lantaner i mára cemenna, ar apa tuianelte carnelte yáve, napánine lestar túxa.” Apa nyarie nati sine, yámes: “Nai ye same hlaru hlaruva!”
But his disciples asked him: “What does the comparison mean?”	Mal hildoryar maquenter senna: “Mana tea i sestie?”
He said: “To you is given to know the secrets of God's kingdom, but to the others it is in comparisons, causing them to look without seeing and hear without understanding.	Eques: “Elden ná antaina ista Eruo araniéno fóler, mal i exin nas sestiessen, tyárala te yéta ú ceniéno ar hlare ú haniéno.
This is what the comparison means: The seed is God's word.	Si ná ya tea i sestie: I erde ná Eruo quetta.
 that are beside the road are that have heard; then the Devil comes and takes away the word from their heart, to stop them from believing and from being saved.	I nar ara i malle nar i ahlárier; tá i Arauco tule ar mapa oa i quetta endaltallo, pustien te saviello ar návello rehtaine.
 that are on the rock are that receive the word with joy when they hear it, but they do not have root; they believe for a time, but in a time of testing they fall away.	I nar i ondosse nar i camir i quetta alassenen íre hlariltes, mal té uar same şundo; savilte ter lúme, mal lúmesse tyastiéno lantalte oa.
 that fell among the thorns, they are that have heard, but being carried away by the anxieties of this life and by riches and by joys, they are choked and complete nothing.	I lantaner imíca i neceli, té nar i ahlárier, mal nála cóline oa coive sino querelínen ar larnen ar alassínen, nalte quórine ar telyar munta.
But that are on the good soil, they are that hear the word with a good and beautiful heard and keep it and make fruit by steadfastness.	Mal i nar i mára cemesse, té nar i hlarir i quetta mára ar vanya endanen ar hepir sa ar colir yáve voronwiénen.
 is no one who, after kindling a lamp, covers it with a vessel or puts it under a bed, but he puts it on the lampstand, allowing that come inside to look at the light.	Ea úquen ye, apa nartie calma, tupe sa venenen hya panya sa nu caima, mal sa-panyas i calmatarmasse, lávala in tulir minna yéta i cala.
And is nothing hidden that will not be revealed, or anything veiled that will not ever be known or easily seen.	An ea munta nurtaina ya ua nauva apantaina, hya aiqua halyaina ya ua oi nauva sinwa hya aşcénima.
Therefore take heed how you listen, for anyone who has, more will be given to him, but anyone who does not have, also which he believes he has will be taken from him.”	Etta cima manen lastalde, an aiquen ye same, amba nauva antaina sen, mal aiquen ye ua same, yando ya savis i samis nauva mapaina sello.”
Now his mother and his brothers came to him, but they could not reach to him because of the crowd.	Sí amillerya ar hánoryar túler senna, mal ualte polle rahta senna i şanganen.
But one told him: “Your mother and your brothers are standing on the outside, wishing to see you.”	Mal mo nyarne sen: “Amillelya ar hánoldar tárar i ettesse, mérala vele lye.”
In answer he said to them: “My mother and my brothers are who hear God's word and do it.”	Hanquentasse quentes téna: “Amillinya ar hánonyar nar i hlarir Eruo quetta ar carir sa.”
It happened in one of the days that he and his disciples went into a boat, and he said to them: “Let us pass over to the other shore of the lake.” Thus they sailed away.	Túle mi er i aurion i sé ar hildoryar lender mir lunte, ar quentes téna: “Alve lahta i hyana fáranna i ailino.” Sie cirnelte oa.
But while they sailed he slept. Now a storm fell upon the lake, and their boat was filled, and they were in danger.	Mal íre cirnelte humnes. Sí raumo lantane i ailinna, ar luntelta náne quátina, ar anelte raxesse.
In the end they went to him and woke him up, saying: “Teacher, teacher, we are dying!” But after rising he rebuked the wind and the violence of the water, and they were made at rest, and was a silence.	I mettasse lendelte senna ar eccoitaner se, quétala: “Peantar, peantar, quálalme!” Mal apa ortie naityanes i şúre ar i neno orme, ar anelte cárine sende, ar enge quilde.
Then he said to them: “Where your faith?” But being scared they were in wonder, saying one to the other: “Who indeed is this man, for he commands also the winds and the water, and they do as he says?”	Tá quentes téna: “Masse savielda?” Mal nála ruhtaine anelte elmendasse, quétala quén i exenna: “É man ná nér sina, an canis yando i şúrin ar i nenen, ar carilte ve quetis?”
And they sailed to country of the Gerasenes, which lies on the other shore from Galilee.	Ar cirnelte nórienna Erasenyaiva, ya caita i hyana hrestasse Alileallo.
And when he went on land, met him a man from the city who was possessed by a a demon; for a long time he did not bear clothes, and he did not dwell in a house, but among the tombs.	Ar íre lendes norenna, se-velle nér i ostollo ye náne haryaina lo rauco; ter anda lúme uas colle lanni, ar uas marne coasse, mal imíca i noiri.
When he saw Jesus, he cried and fell down before him, and he said in a mighty voice: “What for me and for you , Jesus, son of the Most High God? I beg of you, to not torment me!”	Íre cennes Yesus, yámes ar lantane undu epe se, ar quentes taura ómanen: “Mana nin ar lyen, Yésus, Eru Antaro yondo? Iquin lyello, ávani ñwalya!'
For he commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. Beforehand the demon for a long time kept the man fast, and he was bound by chains and by bonds on his feet, while guards watched him, but he tore over the bonds and was driven by the demon into the lonely places.	An cannes i úpoica fairen tule et i nerello. Nóvo i rauco ter anda lúme hempe i nér tanca, ar anes nútina limillínen ar nútelínen talyatse, íre cundor tirner se, mal narcanes i núti ar náne élina lo i rauco mir i erinque nómi.
Jesus asked him: “What is your name?” He said, “Legion,” for numerous demons had gone into him.	Yésus maquente senna: “Mana esselya?” Eques: “Lehion,” an rimbe raucoli náner ménienwe mir se.
And they requested of him that he would not send them into the abyss.	Ar arcanelte sello i ávas mentumne te mir i undume.
But was there a great flock of swine on pasture in the mountain, and they requested of him that he would allow them to pass into them. And he allowed them.	Mal enge tasse hoa lámáre polcaiva nesselesse mí oron, ar arcandelte sello i lavumnes tien auta mir té. Ar láves tien.
Then the demons went out of the man and went into the swine, and the flock went rushing over the edge into the lake and drowned.	Tá i raucor etelender et i nerello ar menner mir i polcar, ar i lámáre lende rimpa olla i lanca mir i ailin ar quorner.
But when the herders saw which had happened, they fled and told it in the city and in the fields.	Mal íre i mavari cenner ya náne martienwa, úşelte ar nyarner sa i ostosse ar i restassen.
Then people came out to see which had happened, and they came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had come out, bearing clothes and in health of mind, sitting by Jesus' feet, and they were terrified.	Tá queni ettúler cenien ya náne martienwa, ar túlelte Yésunna ar hirne i nér yello i raucor náner ettúlienwe, cólala lanneli ar málesse sámo, hámala ara Yésuo talu, ar anelte ruhtaine.
 that saw it told to them how the demon-possessed man was saved.	I cenner sa nyarner tien manen i raucoharyaina nér náne rehtaina.
And the whole multitude from the around-lying country of Gerasenes requested of him that he would go away from them, for they were seized by great fear. Then he went into the boat and sailed away.	Ar i quanda liyúme i oscaitala nóriello Erasenyaiva arcaner sello i autumnes tello, an anelte mapaine túra ruciénen. Tá lendes mir i lunte ar cirne oa.
But the man out of whom the demons were come begged that he would allow him to remain with him. But he sent the man away, saying:	Ono i nér et yello i raucor náner túlienwe inque i lavumnes sen lemya óse. Mal mentanes i nér oa, quétala:
“Return to your home, and tell about the things that God has done for you.” And he went away through the entire city, making known everything that Jesus did for him.	“Nanwena marelyanna, ar nyara pa i nati yar Eru acárie lyen.” Ar lendes oa ter i quanda osto, cárala sinwa ilqua ya Yésus carne sen.
When Jesus returned , he was received by the crowd, for all waited for him.	Íre Yésus nanwenne, anes cámina lo i şanga, an illi lartaner sen.
But behold! a man called Jairus came, and he was the chief of the synagogue. And he fell down before Jesus' knees and requested of him that he would come to his house,	Mal yé! nér estaina Yairo túle, ar sé náne i turco i yomencavo. Ar lantanes undu epe Yésuo occat ar arcane sello i tulumnes coaryanna,
for was with him a daughter, his only child, who had about twelve years, and she near to death.	an enge óse yelde, erya hínarya, ye sáme os loar yunque, ar sé náne hare qualmenna.
When Jesus was on his way, the crowds pressed against him.	Íre Yésus náne malleryasse, i şangar ninder senna.
And a woman, who for twelve years suffered from a flood of blood, for whom it was not possible to get healing from anyone,	Ar nís, ye ter loar yunque perpére celuménen serceva, yen ua ence ñete nestie ho aiquen,
came behind him and touched the rim of his cloak, and in the same moment the flood of blood stopped.	túle ca se ar appane collaryo lane, ar mí imya lú i celume serceva pustane.
And Jesus said: “Who was that touched me?” When all denied it, Peter said: “Teacher, the crowds lie heavily on you and are pressing against you.”	Ar eque Yésus: “Man náne ye appane ni?” Íre illi laquenter sa, Péter quente: “Peantar, i şangar lumnar lyen ar nírar lyenna.”
And yet Jesus said: “A person touched me, for I perceived that went power out of me.”	Ananta Yésus quente: “Quén appane ni, an túnen i lende túre et nillo.”
Seeing that she did not escape notice, the woman came trembling and fell down before him and told before the whole people the reason why she touched Jesus and how she was healed in the same moment.	Cénala i uas úşe tuntie, i nís túle pálala ar lantane undu epe se ar nyarne epe i quanda lie i casta yanen appanes Yésus ar manen anes nestaina mí imya lú.
But Jesus said to her: “Daughter, your faith has saved you; go away in peace!”	Mal Yésus quente senna: “Yelde, savielya erehtie lye; á auta rainesse!”
While he still spoke, a man came from house of the chief of the synagogue, saying: “Your daughter has died. Do not trouble the teacher more.”	Íre en quentes, nér túle coallo i turcova i yomencavo, quétala: “Yeldelya aquálie. Áva tarasta i peantar ambe.”
But hearing that, Jesus answered him: “Do not be afraid; solely believe, and she will be saved.”	Mal hlárala ta, Yésus hanquente senna: “Áva ruce; eryave sava, ar nauvas rehtaina.”
When he came to the house he did not allow anyone to go inside, except Peter and John and Jacob and the maiden's father and mother.	Íre túles i coanna uas láve aiquenen lelya minna, hequa Péteren ar Yohánon ar Yácoven ar i vendeo ataren yo amillen.
But people were wailing and beat themselves in grief about the maiden. And he said: “Do not be wailing, for she did not die, but she is asleep.”	Mal queni náner yaimie ar palpaner inte nyéresse pa i vende. Ar eques: “Áva na yaimie, an uas qualle, mal nas lorna.”
Then they laughed at him, since they knew that she was dead.	Tá lalanelte senna, pan sintelte i anes qualin.
But he took her hand and cried , saying: “Maiden, rise!”	Mal nampes márya ar yáme, quétala: “Vende, á orta!”
And her spirit returned, and she arose in the same moment, and Jesus commanded that one gave her something to eat.	Ar fairerya nanwenne, ar orontes mí imya lú, ar Yésus canne i mo antane sen nat matien.
And her parents were beside themselves; but he instructed them that they were not to tell anyone about which had happened.	Ar nostaryat nánet ara intu; mal peantanes tún i ávatte nyare aiquenen pa ya náne martienwa.
Then he summoned the twelve and gave them control and power over all the demonds, and allowed them to heal diseases.	Tá tultanes i yunque ar antane tien turie ar túre or ilye i raucor, ar láve tien nesta hlívi.
And he sent them to make known God's kingdom and to heal,	Ar te-mentanes carien sinwa Eruo aranie ar nestien,
and he said to them: “Carry nothing for the journey – not staff or bag, not bread or money, and do not bring two tunics.	ar quentes téna: “Cola munta i lendan – lá vandil hya poco, lá masta hya telpe, ar áva tala laupe atta.
But when you go into a house, remain there and go away from there.	Mal íre lelyalde mir coa, á lemya tasse ar á auta talo.
For in every place where people do not heed you, when you are going away from that city shake the dust from your feet as a witness to them.”	Ar mi ilya nóme yasse queni uar cime le, íre autealde sana ostollo á pala i asto taluldalto ve vettie tien.”
Then, going out, they went though the region from village to village, making known the gospel and healing people in every place.	Tá, etelelyala, lendelte ter i ména mastollo mastonna, cárala sinwa i evandilyon ar nestala queni ilya nómesse.
Now Herod the farthing-ruler heard about everything that happened, and he was confused, since was said by some that John was raised out of dead,	Sí Herol i canastantur hlasse pa ilqua ya martane, ar anes rúcina, pan náne quétina lo quelli i Yoháno náne ortaina et qualinillon,
but by others that Eliah had come, but by others that one among the ancient Prophets was raised.	mal lo exeli i Elía náne túlienwa, mal lo exeli i náne ortaina er imíca i enwine Erutercánor.
Herod said: “John's head I cut off. Who, then, is this person of whom I hear such things?” And he sought to see him.	Eque Herol: “Yoháno cas aucirnen. Man, tá, ná quén sina pa ye hlarin taiti nati?” Ar cestanes velitas.
And when the apostles returned they told Jesus about all their deeds. Then he brought them and went to a lonely place, by a city called Bethsaida.	Ar íre i aposteli nanwenner nyarnelte Yésun pa ilye cardaltar. Tá talleset ar lende eressea nómenna, ara osto estaina Vet-Saira.
But the crowds, knowing whither he went, followed him. And he received them and talked to them about God's kingdom, and he healed who had need of healing.	Mal i şangar, istala yanna lendes, hilyaner se. Ar camneset ar carampe téna pa Eruo aranie, ar nestanes i sámer maure nestiéva.
Then, when the day was fading, the twelve came to him and said to him: “Send the crowd away, for them to go into the villages and fields around us, to find a place to remain and food, for here we are in a lonely place.”	Tá, íre i aure náne fifírula, i yunque túler senna ar quenter senna: “Á menta i şanga oa, menieltan mir i mastor ar restar os vi, hirien nóme lemien ar matso, an sisse nalve eressea nómesse.”
But he said to them: “You give them something to eat.” They said: “We do not have more than five breads and two fish, if perhaps we are not to go and trade to ourselves food for all these people.”	Mal quentes téna: “Elde áten anta nat matien.” Quentelte: “Ualme same amba lá mastar lempe ar lingwe atta, qui lá cé menuvalme ar mancuvalme immen matso ilye sine quenin.”
For they were around five thousand people. But he said to his disciples: “Make them lie down in groups of people around fifty in each group.”	An anelte os neri húmi lempe. Mal quentes hildoryannar: “Tyara te caita undu mi hostar queniva os lepenquean mi ilya hosta.”
And they did so and made them all lie down.	Ar carnelte sie ar tyarne te illi caita undu.
Then he took the five breads and two fish and looked into heaven, blessed them and broke them, and he gave them to the disciples to put them before the crowd.	Tá nampes i mastar lempe ar lingwe atta ar yente mir menel, aistane tai ar rance tai, ar antanes tai i hildoin panien tai epe i şanga.
And all ate and were filled, and the remaining pieces that they gathered filled twelve baskets.	Ar illi manter ar náner quátine, ar i lemyala rantar yar hostanelte quanter vircolcar yunque.
And it happened , when he prayed being alone, that the disciples assembled to him, and he asked them so: “Who do the crowds say that I am?”	Ar túle, íre hyamnes nála erinqua, i ocomner senna i hildor, ar maquentes téna sie: “Man i şangar quetir i nanye?”
In answer they said: “John the Baptist; or others: Elijah, or others: that one of the ancient prophets has risen.”	Hanquentasse quentelte: “Yoháno i Tumyando; hya exeli, Elía, hya exeli: i er i enwine Erutercánoron órie.”
Then he said to them: “But you, who do you say that I am?” In answer Peter said: “God's Christ!”	Tá quentes téna: “Mal elde, man quetilde i nanye?” Hanquentasse eque Peter: “Eruo Hristo!”
Then in harsh speech he instructed them that they were not to say so to anyone,	Tá mi naraca quetie peantanes tien i ávalte quetumne sie aiquenna,
but he said: “It is necessary for the Son of Man to go through many sufferings and to be rejected the elders and chief priests and scribes, and to be slain, and on the third day he will be raised up.”	mal eques: “Mauya i Atanyondon mene ter rimbe perperiéli ar náve auquerna lo i amyárar ar hére airimor and parmagolmor, ar náve nanca, ar i neldea auresse nauvas ortaina ama.”
Then he said: “If anyone wants to come after me, it is necessary for him to deny himself and lift his cross every day and follow me.	Tá quentes: “Qui aiquen mere tule apa ni, mauya sen váquete insen ar orta tarwerya ilya auresse ar hilya ní.
For anyone who wishes to save his life, to him it will be lost, but anyone whose life is lost for my good, he will save it.	An aiquen ye mere rehta cuilerya, sen nauvas vanwa, mal aiquen yeo cuile ná vanwa márienyan, sé rehtuva sa.
Indeed how is beneficial to a man if he obtains the whole world, but his own person is lost or destroyed to him?	É manen ná aşea atanen qui ñetis i quanda mar, mal véra quenerya ná sen vanwa hya nancarna?
For anyone who is ashamed over me and over my word, over him the Son of Man will be ashamed when he shall come in his glory and in the Father's and the holy angels' glory.	An aiquen ye ná naityana inyenen ar quettanyanen, sénen i Atanyondo nauva naityana íre tuluvas alcareryasse ar mí Ataro ar i airi valion alcar.
But I say to you in truth: are some that stand here that will not taste death before they will see God's kingdom.”	Mal quetin lenna nanwiesse: Ear quelli i tarir sisse i uar tyavuva qualme nó cenuvalte Eruo aranie.”
It happened after these words, after eight days, that he brought Peter and John and Jacob and went up into the mountain to pray.	Túle apa quettar sine, apa auri tolto, i talles Péter ar Yoháno ar Yácov ar lende ama mir i oron hyamien.
And as he was praying the appearance of his face changed, and his clothes glittered with whiteness.	Ar hyamieryasse cendeleryo ilce ahyane, ar lanneryar mirilyaner ninquissenen.
And behold! two men talked with him, who were Moses and Elijah.	Ar yé! nér atta carampet óse, yet nánet Móses ar Elía.
They showed themselves in glory and spoke about the going away that he was to complete in Jerusalem.	Tannette intu alcaresse ar quenter pa i autie ya telyumnes Yerúsalemesse.
But Peter and those that were with him were heavy with sleep; but after awakening they saw his glory and the two men standing with him.	Ono Péter ar i enger óse náner lunge húmenen; mal apa coivie cennelte alcarerya ar i nér atta tára óse.
And when they went away from him, Peter said to Jesus: “Teacher, it is good that we are here. Therefore let us erect three tents, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah” – for he did not know what he said.	Ar íre tú oantet sello, Péter quente Yésunna: “Peantar, mára ná i nalme sisse. Etta alme orta lancoar nelde, er elyen ar er Mósen ar er Elían” – an uas sinte ya quentes.
But when he said these things was a cloud that overshadowed them, and they were terrified when they went into the cloud.	Mal íre quentes nati sine enge lumbo ya teltane te, ar anelte ruhtaine íre mennelte mir i lumbo.
And a voice came out of the cloud, saying: “This is my son, who has been chosen. Listen to him!”	Ar óma túle et i lumbullo, quétala: “Si ná yondonya, ye anaie cílina. Á lasta senna!”
And after the voice came, Jesus was found alone. But they were silent and did not tell anyone in those days about the things that they saw.	Ar apa i óma túle, Yésus náne hírina erinqua. Mal anelte quilde ar uar nyarne aiquenen yane auressen pa i nati yar cennelte.
On the following day, when they came down from the mountain, a big crowd met him.	I hilyala auresse, íre túlelte undu i orontello, hoa şanga velle se.
And behold! a man cried out of the crowd, saying: “Teacher, I beg of you that you see to my son, for he is my only child,	Ar yé! nér yáme et i şangallo, quétala: “Peantear, iquin lyello i cenil yondonyanna, an náse erya hínanya,
and behold! a demon seizes him, and suddenly he cries , and it causes him to twitch and foam, and it hardly goes away from him after wounding him.	ar yé! rauco mapa se, ar rincenen yamis, ar tyarises rihta ar falasta, ar urdave autas sello apa harnie se.
And I begged of your disciples that they would expel the demon, but was not possible for them.”	Ar inquen hildolyallon i et-hatumner i rauco, mal ua ence tien.”
In answer Jesus said: “O unfaithful and twisted generation, how long will it be necessary for me to remain with you and to bear you? Lead your son hither!”	Hanquentasse Yésus quente: “A úvoronda ar rícina nónare, manen andave mauyuva nin lemya aselde ar cole le? Á tulya yondolya sir!”
But when he was still coming near, the demon threw him to the ground and caused him to twitch. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the boy and gave him to his father.	Mal íre en anes túlala hare, i rauco hante se i talamenna ar tyarne se rihta. Ono Yésus naityane i úpoica faire ar nestane i seldo ar se-antane ataryan.
And all were in wonder about God's majestic power.	Ar illi náner elmendasse pa Eruo meletya túre.
Now when they were seized by wonder about all the things that he did, he said to his disciples:	Sí íre anelte mapaine elmendanen pa ilye i nati yar carnes, quentes hildoryannar:
“Always keep these words in mind, for the Son of Man will be given over into the hands of men.”	“Oi hepa quettar sine sámasse, an i Atanyondo nauva antaina olla mannar atanion.”
But they did not understand this saying; it was hidden from them, to stop them for perceiving was it meant, and they were afraid to ask him about this saying.	Mal ualte hanyane quetie sina; anes nurtaina tello, pustien te tuntiello mana tenges, ar runcelte maquetiello senna pa quetie sina.
Then was a strife among them about who was the greatest among them.	Tá enge cos mici te pa man náne i antúra mici te.
Jesus, knowing how they thought in their heart, took a child and put it next to himself	Yésus, istala manen sannelte endaltasse, nampe hína ar panyane se ara inse
and said to them: “Anyone who receives this child in my name receives me, and anyone who receives me receives the one who sent me. The smallest among you is the greatest.”	ar quente téna: “Aiquen ye came hína sina essenyasse came ní, ar aiquen ye came ní came ye ni-mentane. I ampitya mici le ná i antúra.”
In answer John said: “Teacher, we saw a man expelling demons by your name, and we tried to stop him, since he was not with us.”	Hanquentasse eque Yoháno: “Peantar, cennelme nér et-háta raucor esselyanen, ar névelme pusta se, pan únes aselme.”
But Jeus said to him: “Do not stop him, for that does not stand against you is for you!”	Mal Yésus quente senna: “Ávase pusta, an ye ua tare lenna ná elden!”
Now when the time came near for his being received up, he turned his face towards Jerusalem to go there.	Sí íre i lúme túle hare náveryan cámina ama, quernes cendelerya Yerúsalemanna menien tar.
He sent heralds before himself, and they went away and went into a village of Samaritans, to prepare for him.	Mentanes tercánoli epe inse, ar oantelte ar lender mir masto Samáreaiva, manwien sen.
But they did not want to receive him, since he was on his way to Jerusalem.	Mal ualte merne camitas, pan anes malleryasse Yerúsalemenna.
When the disciples Jacob and John saw that, they said: “Lord, do you wish that we are to command fire to come down from heaven to destroy them?”	Íre i hildor Yácov yo Yoháno cennet ta, quentette: “Heru, ma meril i canuvalve náren tule undu menello nancarien te?”
But he turned himself and rebuked them .	Mal quernes inse ar tu-naityane.
Then he went away to another village.	Tá lendelte hyana mastonna.
When they went on the way a person said to him: “I will follow you to every place that you go away to.”	Íre lendelte i mallesse quén quente senna: “Hilyuvan lye ilya nómenna yanna autal.”
And Jesus said to him: “Foxes have holes and the birds of heaven have nests, but the Son of Man does not have place to put his head.”	Ar Yésus quente senna: “Rusqui samir eccar ar menelo aiwi samir haustar, mal i Atanyondo ua same nóme panien carya.”
Then he said to another man: “Follow me!” The man said: “Allow me first to go away and bring my father to the grave.”	Tá quentes hyana nerenna: “Áni hilya!” I nér quente: “Lava nin minyave auta ar tala atarinya i sapsanna.”
But he said to him: “Let dead bring their dead to the grave, but you go and make the kingdom of heaven known!”	Mal quentes senna: “Lava qualinin tala qualiniltar i sapsanna, mal elye mena ar cara menelo aranie sinwa!”
And another said: “I will follow you, Lord, but first let me say farewell to that are in my house.”	Ar exe quente: “Hilyuvan lye, Heru, mal minyave lava nin quete namárie innar ear coanyasse.”
But Jesus said to him: “Nobody who has put his hand on the plough and looks at the things that lie behind him, is fit for God's kingdom.”	Ono Yésus quente senna: “Úquén ye apánie márya i hyaresse ar yéta i nati yar caita ca se, ná mára Eruo aranien.
After these things the Lord chose seventy others and sent them forth two and two before himself, to every village that he himself would come to.	Apa nati sine i Heru cille exi otoquean ar etementane te atta ar atta epe inse, ilya mastonna yanna sé immo tulumne.
He said to them: “The harvest is abundant, but those who work are few. Therefore ask of the Lord of the harvest, for him to send people to gather his harvest.	Quentes téna: “I yavie ná úvea, mal i molir nar mance. Etta á arca i yaviéno Herullo, mentieryan queni hostien yavierya.
Go out! Behold! I send you like lambs among wolves.	Á etelelya! Yé! Mentan le ve euler mici ñarmor.
Do not carry a pouch, or a bag for food, or a pair of shoes; and do not greet anyone on the road.	Áva cole pocolle, hya poco matson, hya hyapat; ar áva suila aiquen i mallesse.
When you come into a house, first say: 'May this house have peace!'	Íre tulilde mir coa, minyave queta: 'Nai coa sina samuva raine!'
And if is there a friend of peace, your peace will rest upon him. But if is not one, it will return to you.	Ar qui ea tasse meldo raineo, rainelda seruva senna. Mal qui ua ea er, nanwenuvas lenna.
Therefore remain in that house, eating and drinking the things that they give you, for who works is worthy of his reward. Do not move from house to house.	Etta á lemya coa tanasse, mátala ar súcala i nati yar antalte len, an ye mole ná valda paityaleryo. Áva leve coallo coanna.
Furthermore, when you go into a city and they receive you, eat the things put before you,	Ente, íre menilde mir osto ar camilde le, mata i nati panyaine epe le,
and heal the sick ones in it, and tell them: 'God's kingdom has come near to you.'	ar á nesta i hlaiwar sasse, ar nyara tien: 'Eruo aranie utúlie hare lenna.'
But whenever you come into a city and they do not receive you, go into their broad ways and say:	Mal quiquie tulilde mir osto ar ualte came le, mena mir palle malleryar ar queta:
'Also the dust which stuck to our feet from your city we shake away to you. But this thing you are to know, that God's kingdom has come near!'	'Yando i asto ya himyane talulmanta ostoldallo palalme oa lenna. Ono nat sina alde ista, i utúlie hare Eruo aranie!'
I tell you: To Sodom the day of judgement will be more bearable than what it will be to that city.	Nyarin lenna: Soromen i aure namiéva nauva cólima lá ya nauvas sana oston.
Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty deeds that have happened in you happened in Tyre and Sidon, long ago they found repentence, sitting in sack and ash.	Horro lyen, Corasin! Horro lyen, Vet-Saira! An qui i taure cardar yar amartier letse martaner mi Tír ar Síron, andanéya hirnelte inwis, hámala mi fillanne ar litte.
Therefore for Tyre and to Sodom the judgement will be more bearable than for you! 	Etta Tíren ar Síronen i namie nauva cólima lá lent!
And you, Capernaum, will you perhaps be raised up to heaven? Down to Mandos you will come!	Ar elye, Capernaum, ma cé nauval ortaina menelenna? Undu Mandostonna tuluval!
 who listens to you listens to me. And who fails to heed you, fails to heed me. Therefore, who fails to heed me, fails to heed who sent me.”	Ye lasta lenna lasta ninna. Ar ye loita cime lé, loita cime ní. Ente, ye loita cime ní, loita cime ye ni-mentane.”
Then the seventy returned with joy, saying: “Lord, also for the demons it is necessary to heed our orders in your name!”	Tá i otoquean nanwenner mi alasse, quétala: “Heru, yando i raucoin mauya cime canwalmar mi esselya!”
Then he said to them: “I saw Satan fallen like a flash out of heaven.	Tá quentes téna: “Cennen Sátan lantienwa ve íta et menello.
Behold! I have given you the power to trample under your feet serpents and scorpions and the entire might of the enemy, and nothing can wound you.	Yé! Ánien len i túre vettien nu taluldat leucar ar nastaror ar i quanda melehte i ñottova, ar munta pole harna le.
But do not have joy about your control over the demons, but have joy since your names have been written in heaven.”	Mal áva same alasse pa turielda or i raucor, mal sama alasse pan esseldar anaier técine menelde.”
At that time he was most happy by the Holy Spirit and said: “I praise you, Father, Lord over heaven and earth, for you have hidden these things from wise ones and from intelligent ones, and you have revealed them to babes. Yes, Father, for doing so was good in your eyes.	Lúme yanasse anes anvalima i Aire Feanen ar quente: “Laitan tye, Atar, Heru or menel cemenye, an unurtiel nati sine sailallon ar handallon, ar ápantiel tai lapsin. Ná, Átar, an carie sie náne mára hendulyatse.
All things have been given over to me by my Father, and who the Son is nobody knows except the Father, and who the Father is, nobody knows except the Son, and anyone to whom the Son wishes to reveal him.”	Ilye nati anaier antaine olla nin lo Atarinya, ar man i Yondo ná úquen ista hequa i Atar, ar man i Atar ná, úquen ista hequa i Yondo, ar aiquen yen i Yondo mere apanta se.”
And after turning towards the disciples he said: “Happy are the eyes that behold you behold.	Ar apa querie inse i hildonnar quentes: “Valime nát i hendu yat yétat yar elde yétar.
For I say to you: Numerous prophets and kings wished to see the things that you behold, but they did not see them, and hear the things that you hear, but they did not hear them.”	An quetin lenna: Rimbe Erutercánoli ar aralli merner cene i nati yar elde yétar, mal ualte cenne tai, ar hlare i nati yar elde hlarir, mal ualte hlasse tai.”
And behold! a scribe arose, to test him, and he said: “Teacher, what am I to do to be heir of eternal life?”	Ar yé! şanyengolmo oronte, tyastien se, ar eques: “Peantar, mana caruvan náven aryon oira coiviéno?”
He said to him: “What is written in the Law? How do you read?”	Quentes senna: “Mana técina i Şanyesse? Manen hental?”
In answer he said: “You are to love the Lord your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole strenght and your whole mind, and your neighbor as yourself.”	Hanquentasse quentes: “Alye mele i Héru Ainolya quanda endalyanen ar quanda fealyanen ar quanda poldorelyanen ar quanda sámalyanen, ar armarolya ve imle.”
Jesus said to him: “You answered well; do so and you will have life.”	Yésus quente senna: “Hanquentes mai; cara sie ar samuval coivie.”
But he, wishing to show that he was just, said to Jesus: “And who is my neighbor?”	Mal sé, mérala tana i anes faila, quente Yésunna: “Ar man ná armaronya?”
In answer Jesus said: “A man going down from Jerusalem to Jericho fell among robbers, that took his clothes and beat him, abandoning him between life and death.	Hanquentasse Yésus quente: “Nér lelyala undu Yerúsalemello Yericonna lantane mici piluli, i namper lanneryar ar se-palpaner, se-hehtala imbe coive ar qualme.
As happened, a priest went down on that road, but when he saw him, he passed by in the other edge of the road.	Ve martane, airimo lende undu sana mallesse, mal íre se-cennes, langanes i hyana rímasse i malleo.
In the same manner also a Levite, when he came down to the place and saw him, passed by away from him.	Mí imya lé yando Levíon, íre túles undu i nómenna ar cenne se, langane oa sello.
But a Samaritan man travelling on the road came to him, and when he saw him, his heart went out to him.	Mal Samárea nér lelyala i mallesse túle senna, ar íre cenneses, endarya etelende senna.
He came near to him and wrapped his wounds, pouring oil and wine over them. Then he placed him on his animal and brought him to an inn and heeded his needs.	Túles hare senna ar vaitane nahteryar, ulyala millo ar limpe or tai. Tá se-panyanes celvaryasse ar talle se sendassenna ar cimne maureryar.
And on the following day he took two denarii, gave them to the chief of the inn, and said: 'Heed his needs, and anything that you use beyond this, I will pay you back when I shall return hither.'	Ar i hilyala auresse nampes lenár atta, antane tu i turcon i sendasseo, ar quente: 'Cima maureryar, ar aiqua ya yuhtal han si, inye nampaityuva lyen íre nanwenuvan sir.'
Who among these three do you think made himself a neighbor to the man who fell among the robbers?”	Man mici nelde sine sanal carne inse armaro i neren ye lantane imíca i pilur?”
He said: “ who had mercy on him.” Jesus thens said to him: “You go and do the same thing.”	Eques: “Ye oráve sesse.” Yésus tá quente senna: “Alye mene ar care i imya nat.”
Now when they went away he went into a city. Here a woman called Martha received him into her house.	Sí íre oantelte lendes mir masto. Sisse nís estaina Marşa camne se mir coarya.
 was with this woman a sister whose name was Mary, who sat down by the feet of the Lord and listened to his word.	Enge as nís sina néşa yeo esse náne María, ye hamne undu ara i Heruo talu ar lastane quettaryanna.
But Martha had her hands full with much work, and she came and said: “Lord, is it not important to you that my sister has left me alone in my work? Therefore say to her that it is necessary for her to help me.”	Mal Marşa sáme máryat quante olya moliénen, ar túles ar quente: “Heru, ma ua valda lyen i néşanya ni-ehehtie erinqua molienyasse? Etta queta senna i mauya sen manya ni.”
In answer the Lord said to her: “Martha, Martha, you have anxiety and you are troubled about numerous things.	Hanquentasse i Heru quente senna: “Marşa, Marşa, samil quárele ar nalye tarastaina pa rimbe natali.
But of a single thing is need. Mary has chosen the good part, and it will not be taken from her.”	Mal erya natwa ea maure. María icílie i mára ranta, ar sá ua nauva mapaina sello.”
And it happened , when he was in a place praying, that when he stopped one of his disciples said to him: “Lord, teach us to pray, like John also taught his disciples.”	Ar túle, íre enges nómesse hyámala, i íre pustanes quén hildoryaron quente senna: “Heru, ámen peanta hyame, ve Yoháno yando peantane hildoryain.”
Then he said to them: “Whenever you pray, say: Father, let your name be holy. Let your kingdom come.	Tá quentes téna: “Quiquie hyamilde, queta: Atar, na aire esselya. Aranielya na tuluva.
Give us our daily bread day after day,	Ámen anta ilaurea massalma aure apa aure,
and forgive us our sins, for also we forgive everyone who has a debt to us; and do not lead us into temptation.”	ar ámen apsene úcarelmar, an yando elme apsenir ilquenen ye same rohta men; ar ávame tulya úşahtienna.”
And he said to them: “Who among you that has a friend will go to him in the midst of the night and will say to him: 'Friend, loan me three loaves,	Ar quentes téna: “Man mici le ye same meldo lelyuva senna endesse i lómio ar quetuva senna: 'Meldo, áni yutya massainen nelde,
for a friend of mine has come to me from a journey and I have nothing to put before him'?	an meldo ninya utúlie ninna lendallo ar samin munta panien epe se'?
And he from the inside says in answer: 'Do not trouble me! The door is shut, and my children are with me in the bed; it is not possible for me to rise to give you .'	Ar sé i mityallo quete hanquentasse: 'Ávani tarasta! I fenna ná pahta, ar hínanyar nar asinye i caimasse; ua ece nin orta antien lyen.'
I say to you: If he does not rise and give to him since he is his friend, indeed he will rise and give to him because of his persistence .	Quetin lenna: Qui uas orta ar anta sen pan náse meldorya, é ortuvas ar antuva sen vorongandeleryanen.
Therefore I say to you: Ask, and will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.	Etta quetin lenna: Á arca, ar nauva len antaina; á cesta, ar hiruvalde; á tamba, ar nauva len latyaina.
For everyone asking receives, and everyone seeking finds, and to everyone knocking will be opened.	An ilquen arcala came, ar ilquen cestala hire, ar ilquenen tambala nauva latyaina.
Surely is not father among you who, if his son asks for a fish, will perhaps give him a serpent instead of a fish?	Lau ea atar mici le ye, qui yondorya arca lingwe, cé antuva sen leuca mende lingwio?
Or if he also asks for an egg, surely he will not give him a scorpion?	Hya qui yando arcas ohte, lau antuvas sen nestaro?
Therefore, if you that are wicked know to give good gifts to your children, how more the heavenly Father will give Holy Spirit to those that ask of him!”	Etta, qui elde i nar olce istar anta máre annar hínaldain, manen ole i menelda Atar antuva Aire Fea in arcar sello!”
And he expelled a dumb demon. After the demon came out, the dumb man spoke. And the crowds were in wonder.	Ar et-hantes úpa rauco. Apa i rauco ettúle, i úpa nér carampe. Ar i şangar náner elmendasse.
But some among them said: “He expels the demons by the chief of of the demons, Belzebul.”	Mal quelli mici te quenter: “Et-hatis i raucor turconen i raucoron, Vélsevul.”
But others, in order to test him, sought from him a sign out of heaven.	Ono exeli, tyastien se, cestaner sello tanwa et menello.
Knowing their imaginations he said to them: “Every kingdom split against itself is undone, and a home split against itself falls.	Istala símaltar quentes téna: “Ilya aranie şanca insanna ná nancarna, ar már şanca insanna lanta.
But if also Satan is split against himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say that I expel the demons by Belzebub's power.	Mal qui yando Sátan ná şanca insenna, manen aranierya taruva? An quetilde i et-hatin i raucor Vélsevúlo túrenen.
If by the power of Beelsebul I throw out demons, by whom do your sons throw them out? For this reason they will be your judges.	Qui túrenen Vélsevúlo et-hatin raucor, mannen yondolyar et-hatir te? Sina castanen nauvalte námoldar.
But if by God's finger I throw the demons out, God's kingdom has indeed come to you.	Mal qui Eruo lepernen et-hatin i raucor, Eruo aranie é utúlie lenna.
When a strong man, having weapons, protects his own court, his goods are in peace.	Íre polda nér, arwa carmaron, varya véra pacarya, armaryar nar rainesse.
But when a man stronger than him comes and overpowers him, he takes away the weapons which the other thought were going to give him security, and he distributes the things that he stole from him.	Mal íre nér polda lá sé tule ar orture se, mapas oa i carmar ya i exe sanne antumner sen varnasse, ar etsatis i nati yar píles sello.
 who is not with me stands against me, and who does not gather, scatters.	Ye ua asinye tare ninna, ar ye ua hosta, vinta.
When an unclean spirit comes out of a man, it passes through try regions seeking a place of rest, and when it does not find one, it says: 'I will return to my house from which I moved.'	Íre úpoica faire tule et nerello, langas ter parce ménar cestala nóme séreva, ar íre uas hire, quetis: 'Nanwenuvan coanyanna yallo léven.'
And when it comes, it finds it made clean and adorned.	Ar íre tulis, hiris sa carna poica ar netyaina.
Then it goes away and brings with it seven other spirits, more wicked then itself, and after they come in they dwell there, and to that man the last state will be worse than the first.”	Tá autas ar tala óse hyane fairi otso, olce lá inse, ar apa tulilte minna marilte tasse, ar tana neren i métima sóma nauva ulca lá i minya.”
Now when he was saying these things, a woman out of the crowd raised her voice and said to him: “Happy the womb that bore you and the teats from which you were suckled!”	Sí íre sé náne quétala nati sine, nís et i şangallo ortane ómarya ar quente senna: “Valime i súma ya lye-colle ar i i tyetsu yalto anel tyétina!”
But he said: “ is better if you say: Happy are that hear God's word and keep it!”	Mal eques: “Arya ná qui quetil: Valime nar i hlarir Eruo quetta ar hepir sa!”
When the crowds gathered, he said: “This generation is an evil generation. It asks for signs, but a sign will not be given to it, except the sign of Jonah.	Íre i şangar ocomner, quentes: “Nónare sina ná ulca nónare! Arcas tanwar, mal tanwa ua nauva antaina san, hequa Yóno tanwa.
For like Jonah was made a sign to the people in Nineveh, so also the Son of Man will be a sign to this generation.	An ve Yóna náne carna tanwa i lien Ninevesse, sie yando i Atanyondo nauva tanwa nónare sinan.
The queen of the south will be raised in the judgement with this generation and will judge them evil, for she came from the end of the earth to hear Solomon's wisdom, and behold, here is more than Solomon.	Hyarmeno tári nauva ortaina i namiesse as i queni nónare sino ar namuva te ulce, an túles cemeno mettallo hlarien Solomondo sailie – ar yé, sisse ea amba lá Solomon!
The people from Niniveh will rise in the judgement with this generation and will judge it evil. For they found repentence at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, here is more than Jonah!	I queni Ninevello ortuvar i namiesse as nónare sina ar namuva sa ulca. An hirnelte inwis Yóno nyardiénen, ar yé, sisse ea amba lá Yóna!
After lighting a lamp, one does not put it in a vault or under a measuring basket, but on the lampstand, allowing those that come in to see the light.	Apa nartie calma, mo ua panya sa cambosse hya nu lestacolca, mal i calmatarmasse, lávala in tulir minna cene i cala.
To the body, the lamp is your eye. When your eye is in health, your entire body is also bright, but when it is evil, your body is also dark.	I hroan, i calma ná hendelya. Íre heldenya ná málesse, quanda hroalya ná yando calima, mal íre nas olca, hroalya ná yando morna.
Therefore take heed that that light which is in you is not darkness!	Etta cima i sana cala ya ea lyesse ua mornie!
Thus, if your entire body is illuminated, not having part which is dark, everything will be illuminated as when the lamp illumulates you with its ray!”	Sie, qui quanda hroalya ná calyaina, lá arwa ranto ya ná morna, ilqua nauva calyaina ve íre i calma calya lye alcaryanen!”
After he said that, a Pharisee requested that he would eat a meal with him. Therefore he went inside and lay down at the table.	Apa quentes ta, Farisa arcane i matumnes mat óse. Etta lendes minna ar caine undu ara i sarno.
But the Pharisee was in wonder when he saw that he did not first wash himself before the meal.	Mal i Farisa náne elmendasse íre cennes i uas minyave sove inse nó i mat.
But the Lord said to him: “Now, O Pharisees! You cleanse the outside of the cup and of the dish, but in the inside of you you are full of theft and wickedness!	Mal i Heru quente senna: “Sí, a Farisar! Poitalde i ette i yulmo ar veneo, mal mityaldasse nalde quante pilweo ar olciéno.
Senseless ones! who created the outside, did he not also create the inside?	Úhandar! Ye ontane i ette, ma uas ontane yando i mitya?
But give gifts to poor ones out of which is in your inside, and behold! everything will be clean to you.	Mal á anta annar penyain et yallo ea mityaldasse, ar yé! ilqua nauva poica len.
But woe to you, o Pharisees, since you give the tenth part of the mint and of the rue and of every vegetable, but you pass over the justice and the love for God! These things were necessary for you to do, without passing over the others.	Mal horro len, a Farisar, pan antalde i quaista ranta i minto ar i laiquelisso ar ilya queo, mal langalde i failie ar i melme Eruva! Nati sine mauyaner len care, ú lengiéno i exi.
Woe to you, o Pharisees, since you love to have the prominent seats in the synagoges and to receive the greatings in the market places.	Horro len, a Farisar, an melilde same i minde sondar i yomencoassen ar came i suilier mí mancalenómi.
Woe to you, for you are like the tombs that are not easy to see, causing people to walk over them without knowing.”	Horro len, an nalde ve i noiri yar uar aşcénime, tyárala queni vanta olla tai ú istiéno.”
In answer one among the lawyers said to him: “Teacher, by saying these things you give an evil name also to us.”	Hanquentasse quén imíca i şanyengolmor quente senna: “Peantar, quetiénen nati sine antal ulca esse yando elmen.”
Then he said: “Woe also to you who are lawyers, for you put on men burders hard to bear, but you do not touch the burdens with a single one of your fingers!	Tá quentes: “Horro yando len i nar şanyengolmor, an panyalde atanissen cólor urde colien, mal elde uar appa i cólar eryanen leperildaron!
Woe to you, for you build the tombs for the prophets, but your fathers killed them!	Horro len, an carastalde i noiri i Erutercánoin, mal atarildar nacanter te!
Indeed you are witnesses and think well of the deeds of your fathers, for they killed the prophets, but you build their tombs!	É nalde astarmor ar sanar mai pa atarildaron cardar, an té necanter i Erutercánor, mal elde carastar noiriltar!
For this reason God's wisdom said: I will send to them prophets and apostles, and they will kill and they will persecute some among them,	Sina castanen Eruo sailie quente: Mentuvan téna Erutercánor ar aposteli, ar nahtuvalte ar roituvalte quelli mici te,
and so the blood of all the prophets that has been poured from the foundation of the world until now will be demanded from this generation,	ar sie ilye i Erutercánoron serce ya anaie ulyaina i mardo tulciello tenna sí nauva cánina nónare sinallo,
from the blood of Abel until the blood of Zechariah, who was slain between the altar and the house. Yes, I tell you, it will be demanded from this generation!	sercello Ávelo tenna serce Secarío, ye náne nanca imbi i yangwe ar i coa. Ná, nyarin len, nauvas cánina nónare sinallo!
Woe to you that are scribes, for you have taken away the key of knowledge; you did not go inside, and who wished to go inside you stopped!”	Horro len i nar şanyengolmor, an amápielde oa i latil istyava; elde uar lende minna, ar i merner lelya minna pustanelde!”
When he went out from there the the scribes and the Pharisees started to press against him terribly and to pour upon him questions about other things,	Íre etelendes talo i parmangolmor ar i Farisar yestaner nire senna aicave ar ulya senna maquetiéli pa hyane natali,
watching him to seize something out of his mouth.	se-tírala mapien nat et antoryallo.
At that time, when the crowd had gathered in tens of thousands, so numerous that one trampled the other down, he began to say to his disciples first: “Keep yourselves away from the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.	Lúme yanasse, íre i şanga náne ocómienwa mi quaihúmeli, ta rimbe i quén vattane i exe undu, yestanes quete hildoryannar minyave: “Hepa inde oa i pulmaxello i Fariryaron, yá imnetie ná.
But is nothing hidden that will not be revealed, or secret that will not be known.	Mal ea munta nurtaina ya ua nauva apantaina, hya nulda ya ua nauva sinwa.
Therefore, all things which you say in the darkness will be heard in the light, and what you whisper in your own chambers will be made known from the roofs of the houses.	Etta, ilye nati yar quetilde i morniesse nauvar hlárine i calasse, ar ya hlussalde vére şamberyassen nauva carna sinwa i coaron tópallon.
Moreover, I say to you that are my friends: Do not fear from that kill the body and thereafter cannot do more.	Ente, quetin lenna i nar meldonyar: Áva ruce illon nahtar i hroa ar epeta uar pole care amba.
But I will show you whom it is necessary for you to fear: Fear who after killing has the power of throwing into Gehenna. Yes, I say to you, fear him!”	Mal tanuvan len manello mauya len ruce: Ruca yello apa nehtie same i túre hatiéva mir Ehenna. Ná, quetin lenna, ruca sello!”
Two sparrows are sold for two copper pieces, no? And yet God does not fail to recall one among them .	Filit atta nát vácine mitta urusteva attan, lá? Ananta Eru ua loita enyale er mici tu.
But also the hairs of your head are all counted. Do not fear; you are more precious than many sparrows.	Mal yando careldo findi nar illi nótine. Áva ruce; nalde mirwe lá rimbe filici.
But I say to you: Everyone who confesses me before men, him the Son of Man will also confess before God's angels.	Mal quetin lenna: Ilquen ye etequenta ni epe atani, sé i Atanyondo yando etequentuva epe Eruo vali.
But who denies me before men will be denied before God's angels.	Mal ye laquete ni epe atani nauva laquétina epe Eruo vali.
And to everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man, that will be fogiven, but to who blasphemes agaist the Holy Sprit, that will not be forgiven.	Ar ilquenen ye quete quetta i Atanyondonna, ta nauva apsénina, mal yen naiquete i Aire Feanna, ta ua nauva apsénina.
But when they bring you before councils and governors and powers, do not have anxiety about how or with what you will defend yourselves, or about what you will say;	Mal íre talalde le epe combi ar cánor ar túri, áva same quárele pa manen hya mananen varyuvalde inde, hya pa mana quetuvalde;
for the Holy Spirit will teach you in that hour about the things that it is necessary for you to say.”	an i Aire Fea peantuva lúme entasse pa i nati yar mauyar len quete.”
Then a person in the crowd said to him: “Teacher, say to my brother that is necessary for him to give me a portion in the inheritance!”	Tá quén i şangasse quente senna: “Peantar, queta hánonyanna i mauya sen anta nin masse i aryoniesse!”
He said to him: “O man, who put me to judge you or to distribute to you your inheritance?”	Quentes senna: “A nér, man ni-panyane namien let hya etsatien lent aryoniesta?”
Then he said to them: “Take heed and protect yourselves from all greed, for also when a person has abundance, his life does not come from his possessions.”	Tá quentes téna: “Cima ar á varya inde ilya milciello, an yando íre quén same úve, coivierya ua tule armaryallon.”
Furthermore, he spoke to them a comparison, saying: “The land of a rich man gave a big harvest.	Ente, quentes téna sestie, quétala: “I nóre lárea nerwa antane hoa yávie.
And he made a consideration in his mind, saying: 'What am I to do, now when I lack a place where I can gather my harvest?'	Ar carnes úvie sámaryasse, quétala: 'Mana caruvan, sí ire penin nóme yasse polin hosta yávienya?'
And he said: 'I will do so: I will tear down my stores, and I will build some stores larger than them, and there I will gather all my grain and all my good things,	Ar quentes: 'Caruvan sie: Nancaruvan hauranyar, ar carastuvan haurali hoe lá tai, ar tasse hostuvan ilya orenya ar ilye máre natinyar;
and I will say do myself: 'Now you have numerous good things in store for many years. Rest, eat, drink, have joy!'	ar quetuvan imninna: 'Sí samil rimbe máre natali haurasse rimbe loalin. Sera, mata, suca, sama alasse!'
But God said to him: 'Senseless man! In this night they demand your life from you. Then who will have that you have gathered?' So will be for who gathers treasure for himself, but is not rich to God.”	Mal Eru quente senna: 'Úhanda nér! Lóme sinasse canilte cuilelya lyello. Tá man samuva yar ahastiel?' Sie euva yen hosta harma insen, mal ua lárea Erun.”
Then he said to his disciples: “For this reason I say to you: Do not have anxiety about yourselves, about what you will eat, or about your bodies, about the things that you will wear.	Tá quentes hildoryannar: “Sina castanen quetin lenna: Áva same quárele pa inde, pa mana matuvalde, hya pa hroaldar, pa i lanni yar coluvalde.
For the life is more precious than food, and the body than clothes.	An i cuile ná mirwa lá matso, ar i hroa lá lanni.
Give heed to the ravens , that they do not sow or harvest, and they do not have stores or buildings for keeping thigns, and yet God gives them food. How more precious than birds you are!	Cima i quácor, i ualte rere hya cirihta, ar ualte same haurar hya ataqui hepien nati, ananta Eru anta tien masto. Manen mirwe lá aiwi elde nar!
Who among you, by worrying, can add a single cubit to the length of his life?	Man mici le, quáreleryanen, pole napane erya perranga coivieryo andienna?
If thus you cannot do the smallest thing, how is that you have worries about the remaining things?	Qui sie ualde pole care i ampitya nat, manen ná i samilde quárele pa i lemyala nati?
Heed how the lilies grow; they do not toil or weave, but I tell you: Also Solomon in all his glory was not adorned like one among them!	Cima manen i indili alir; ualte móta hya lanya, mal nyarin len: Yando Solomon ilya alcareryasse úne netyaina ve er mici té!
If God so adorns the plants in the field, that exist today and tomorrow are thrown into an oven, how much more will he adorn you, you of little faith!	Qui Eru sie netya i celvar i restasse, i ear síra ar enwa nar hátine mir urna, manen ole ambe netyuvas lé, elde pitya saviéno!
Therefore do not seek what you are to eat or what you are to drink, and do not have anxiety,	Etta áva cesta mana matuvalde hya mana sucuvalde, ar áva same quárele,
for all these things are that the nations of the world seek, but your Father knows that you have need of these things.	an ilye nati sine nar yar i mardo nóri cestar, ono Atarelda ista i samilde maure sine nativa.
But seek first his kingdom, and these things will be added to you!	Mal á cesta minyave aranierya, ar nati sine nauvar len napánine!
Do not be afraid, o little flock, for your Father has thought well to give you the kingdom!	Áva ruce, á pitya lámáre, an Atarelda asánie mai anta len i aranie!
Sell that you have and give gifts to the poor. Make for yourselves pouches that will not ever wear, an unfailing treasure in heaven, where a thief does not come near or a moth devour.	Vaca yar samilde ar á anta annar i penyain. Cara len pocoller i ua oi yeryuvar, alaloitala harma menelde, yasse arpo ua tule hare hya malo ammate.
For where your treasure is, there also your heart will be.	An yasse harmalda ea, tasse yando endalda euva.
Keep the belt on your hips and your lamps burning,	Hepa i quilta oşweldasse ar calmaldar uryala,
and you be like men looking forward to their master's return from the marriage, for them to be able to open to him in the same moment that he comes knocking.	ar elde na ve atani yétala ompa herulto entulessenna i veryanwello, polieltan latya sen mí imya lú ya tulis tambala.
Happy are the thralls whose master, when he returns, finds them watching! Truly I say to you: He will bind around his hip and will allow them to lie at the table, and he will come to be a servant to them.	Valime nar i móli ion heru, íre nanwenis, hire te tíra! Násie quetin lenna: Notuvas os oşwerya ar lavuva tien caita ara i sarno, ar tuluvas náven núro tien.
And if he comes in the second watch, or in the third, and finds them so, happy they are!	Ar qui tulis mí attea tirisse, hya mí neldea, ar hire te sie, valime nalte!
But know this thing, that if the master of the house knew the time when the thief was going to come, he was awake and did not allow anyone to break into his house.	Mal á ista nat sina, i qui i coantur sinte i lúme yasse i arpo tulumne, anes coiva ar ua láve aiquenen race mir coarya.
You as well be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at a time that you do not think.	Yando elde na manwaine, an i Atanyondo túla mi lúme ya ualde sana.
Then Peter said: “Lord, do you speak this comparison to us or also to all?”	Tá Péter quente: “Heru, ma quetil sestie sina elmenna hya yando ilyannar?”
And the Lord said: “Indeed who is the faithful steward, the intelligent one, in whose oversight his lord will place all his servants, for him to give them their food at the proper time?	Ar i Heru quente: “É man ná i voronda mardil, i handa, yeo ortíriesse herurya panyuva ilye núroryar, antieryan tien matsolta mí vanima lúme?
Happy is that thrall, whom his master when he comes will find doing so.	Valima ná mól tana, ye herurya íre tulis hiruva cára sie.
Truly I say to you that over all his goods he will put him.	Nanwave quetin lenna i or ilye armaryar se-panyuvas.
But if that thrall says in his heart: 'My master will not come soon', and he begins to strike the servants and the maidservants, and eats and drinks and fills himself with wine,	Mal qui mól tana quete endaryasse: 'Herunya ua tuluva rato', ar yestas pete i núror ar i núri, ar mate ar suce ar quate inse limpenen,
that thrall's master will come in a day that he does not think and at an hour that he does not know, and he will cut him in two and give him his portion with the faithless ones.	mól tano heru tuluva auresse ya uas sana ar lúmesse ya uas ista, ar se-peryuvas ar sen-antuva masserya as i úvorondar.
Then that thrall who understood his master's wish, but did not prepear himself or did his will, will be beaten with many blows.	Tá mól tana ye hanyane heruryo şelma, mal ua manwane inse hya carne şelmarya, nauva palpaina rimbe tarambolínen.
But who did not understand it, and so did things worthy of beating, will be beaten with few blows. For from anyone to whom much has been given, much will be demanded, and from a person in whose oversight they have placed much, they will demand more than usual.	Mal ye ua hanyane sa, ar sie carne nati valde palpiéno, nauva palpaina mance tarambolínen. An ho ilquen yen olya anaie antaina, olya nauva cánina, ar ho quén yeo ortíriesse apánielte olya, canuvalte amba lá senwa.
A fire I have come to throw upon earth, and what am I to wish if it has been kindled even now?	Náre utúlien hate cemenna, ar mana meruvan qui anaies nartaina yando sí?
A baptism I have that I will be baptized with, and how pressed I am until it has been completed!	Tumyale samin yanen nauvan tumyaina, ar manen nírina nanye tenna anaies telyaina!
Do you think that I have come to give peace on earth? No, I say to you, but division!	Ma sanalde i utúlien antien raine cemende? Ui, quetin lenna, mal şancie!
For from now will be five split in a single house, three against two and two against three.	An ho sí euvar lempe şance erya coasse, nelde attanna ar atta neldenna.
They will be split, father against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, and a woman against her son's wife, and the wife against her husband's mother.”	Nauvalte şance, atar yondonna ar yondo atarenna, amil yeldenna ar yelde amillenna, ar nís yondoryo verinna, ar i veri veruryo amillenna.”
Then he also said to the crowds: “When you see a cloud rising in the West, in the same moment you say: A storm is coming – and so it will be.	Tá yando quentes i şangannar: “Íre cenilde lumbo ortea Númesse, mí imya lú quetilde: Raumo túla – ar sie euva.
And when you see wind that blows from South, you say: It will be hot – and so it will be.	Ar íre cenilde şúre ya váva Hyarmello, quetilde: Lauca nauva – ar sie euva.
Hypocrites, you know to read the appearance of earth and heaven, but how is that you do not know to read this time?	Imnetyandor, istalde henta cemeno ar menelo ilce, mal manen ná i ualde ista henta lúme sina?
How is that you cannot judge also for yourselves what is just?	Manen ná i ualde name yando elden mana faila ná?
For when you are going with your enemy to a judge, strive in the way to be free from your strife with him – or he will draw you before the judge, and the judge will give you over to the court servant , and the court-servant will throw you into jail.	An íre ménal as ñottolya námonna, rica mí malle náven léra costelyallo óse – hya tucuvas lye epe i námo, ar i námo antuva lye olla i námondurenna, ar i námondur hatuva lye mir mando.
I tell you: You will not come out from there before you have paid the last small piece of copper!”	Nyarin lyen: Ual ettuluva talo nó apaitiel i métima pitya ranta urusteva!”
At that time some that were there told him about the people from Galilee whose blood Pilate poured forth into the blood of their sacrifices.	Lúme yanasse quelli i enger tasse nyarner sen pa i queni Alileallo ion serce Piláto etulyane mir serce yancaltaron.
Therefore in answer he said to them: “Do you suppose that these people from Galilee were sinners greater than all others in Galilee, since they suffered that?	Etta hanquentasse quentes téna: “Ma intyalde i queni sine Alileallo náner úcarindoli ambe túre lá ilye exi Alileasse, pan perpérelte ta?
By no means, I say to you; but if you do not find repentance, all among you will be destroyed in the same manner.	Laume, quetin lenna; mal qui ualde hire inwis, illi mici le nauvar nancárine mí imya lé.
Or the eighteen upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, killing them – do you suppose that they had a debt greater than which all others that live in Jerusalem have?	Hya i toloque innar i mindo Siloamesse lantane, nahtala te – ma intyalde i sámelte rohta túra lá ya ilye exi i marir Yerúsalemesse samir?
By no means, I say to you; but if you do not find repentance, all among you will be destroyed in the same manner.	Laume, quetin lenna; mal qui ualde hire inwis, illi mici le nauvar nancárine mí imya lé.
Then he spoke to them this comparison: “A man had a fig tree in his garden of vines, and he came to seek fruit on it, but he found nothing.	Tá quentes téna sestie sina: “Nér sáme relyávalda tarwaryasse liantassion, ar túles cestien yáve sesse, mal hirnes munta.
Then he said to the gardener: 'Look, for three years I have come seeking fruit on this fig tree, but I have found nothing. Cut it down! What reason is for keeping it there, keeping the ground without giving fruit?'”	Tá quentes i tarwandurenna: 'Yé, loassen nelde utúlien cestala yáve relyávalda sinasse, mal ihírien munta. Áse cire undu! Mana casta ea hepien se tasse, hépala i talan ú antiéno yáve?'
In answer he said to him: 'Lord, allow it do stand also this year, and I will dig around it and will place muck there.	Hanquentasse quentes senna: 'Heru, ásen lave tare yando loa sinasse, ar sapuvan os se ar panyuva múco tasse.
If it will then give fruit in the coming year, very well. But if it does not, you will cut it down.'”	Qui tá antuvas yáve i túlala loasse, mára ná. Mal qui laias, ciruvalyes undu.'”
Now Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues on the day of rest.	Sí Yésus náne peantala mi er i yomencoaron i sendaresse.
And behold! was there a woman who for eighteen years was possessed by a spirit making her weak: She was bent, and it was not possible for her to stand straight.	Ar yé! enge tasse nís ye ter loar toloque náne haryaina lo faire se-cárala milya: Anes cúna, ar ua ence sen tare téra.
But when he saw the woman, Jesus called her to himself and said: “Woman, you are freed from the illness making you weak.”	Mal íre cennes i nís, Yésus yalle se insenna ar quente: “Nís, nalye leryaina i hlívello lye-cárala milya.”
And he put his hands on her, and in the same moment she arose to stand straight, and she gave glory to God.	Ar panyanes máryat sesse, ar mí imya lú orontes tarien téra, ar antanes alcar Erun.
But the chief of the synagogue, being angry since Jesus healed on the day of rest, said to the crowd: “There are six days in which it is necessary to work. There come on them to be healed, and not on the day of rest!”	Mal i turco i yomencavo, nála rúşea pan Yésus nestane i sendaresse, quente i şanganna: “Ear auri enque yassen mauya mole! Etta tula mi tai náven nestaina, ar lá i sendaresse!”
But the Lord answered him: “Hypocrites, does not everyone among you on the day of rest loose his ox or his ass from the manger and lead it away to drink?	Mal i Heru hanquente senna: “Imnetyandor, ma ua ilquen mici le i sendaresse lehta mundorya hya pelloporya ho i salquecolca ar tulya se oa sucien?
But this woman, who is a daughter of Abraham whom Satan has kept restrained for eighteen years – was it not necessary to loose her from this bond on the day of rest?”	Mal nís sina, ye ná Avraham yelde ye Sátan ehépie hampa ter loar toloque – ma ua mauyane se-lehta núte sinallo i sendaresse?”
And when he said that, all that stood against him were humiliated, and the entire crowd had joy concerning all the glorious things that happened by him.	Ar íre quentes ta, ilye i tarner senna náner nucumne, ar i quanda şanga sáme alasse pa ilye i alquarinque nati yar martaner sénen.
Therefore he said: “Like what God's kingdom, and with what am I to compare it?	Etta quentes: “Ve mana Eruo aranie, ar as mana sestuvanyes?
It is like a seed of mustard, that a man took and put in his garden, and it grew into a tree, and the birds of heaven dwelt in its branches.”	Nas ve erde sinapio, ya nér nampe ar panyane tarwaryasse, ar alles mir alda, ar menelo aiwi marner olvaryassen.”
And again he said: “With what am I to compare God's kingdom?	Ar ata quentes: “As mana sestuvan Eruo aranie?
It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, until everythign was leavened .”	Nas ve pulmaxe, ya nís nampe ar nurtane lestassen nelde poriva, tenna ilqua náne púlienwa.”
And he went from city to city and from village to village, teaching while he was travelling to Jerusalem.	Ar lendes ostollo ostonna ar mastollo mastonna, peantala íre lelendes Yerúsalemenna.
Now a person said to him: “Lord, are the saved ones few?” He said to them:	Sí quén quente senna: “Heru, ma nar i rehtainar mance?” Quentes téna:
“Strive to go inside through the narrow door! For numerous ones, I say to you, will seek to go inside, but they will not be able,	“Rica menien minna ter i náha fenna! An rimbali, quetin lenna, cestuvar mene minna, mal ualte poluva,
from the hour that he master of the house has arisen and has closed the door, and you stand on the outside, knocking on the door, saying: 'Lord, open to us!' But in answer he will say to you: 'I do not know where you have come from.'	i lúmello ya i heru i cavo orontie ar apahtie i fenna, ar tarilde i ettesse, tambala i fennasse, quétala: 'Heru, ámen latya!' Mal hanquentasse quetuvas lenna: 'Uan ista mallo utúlielde.'
Then you will say: 'We ate and drank before you, and you taught in our streets!'	Tá quetuvalde: 'Mantelme ar suncelme epe lye, ar peantanel mallelmassen!'
But he will answer you so: 'I do not know where you have come from. Begone from me, all who do unrighteousness!'	Mal hanquetuvas lenna sie: 'Uan ista mallo utúlielde. Heca nillo, ilye i carir úfailie!'
There your wailing and your grinding of teeth will be, when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in God's kingdom, but you are thrown outside.	Tasse yaimelda ar molielda nelciva euvar, íre cenilde Avraham ar Ísac ar Yácov ar ilye i Erutercánor mi Eruo aranie, mal elde nar hátine ettenna.
Furthermore, people will come from East and West and North and South, and they will lie at the table in God's kingdom.	Ente, queni tuluvar Rómello ar Númello ar Formello ar Hyarmello, ar caituvalte ara i sarno mi Eruo aranie.
And behold! are some last ones that will be first, and are some first ones that will be last.”	Ar yé! ear teldali i nauvar minye, ar ear minyali i nauvar telde.”
At that time came some Pharisees that said to him: “Go out and go away from here, for Herod wishes to kill you!”	Lúme yanasse túler Farisáli i quenter senna: “Mena ettenna ar á auta silo, an Herol mere nahta lye!”
And he said to them: “Go and say to that fox: Behold, I throw out demons and I perform healing today and tomorrow, and on the third day I am finished.	Ar quentes téna: “Mena ar queta rusco tananna: Yé, et-hatin raucor ar carin nestie síra ar enwa, ar i neldea auresse nauvan telyaina.
And yet it is necessary for me to keep travelling on my road today and tomorrow and on the following day, for it is not allowed for a prophet to be destroyed outside of Jerusalem.	Ananta mauya nin lelelya mallenyasse síra ar enwa ar i hilyala auresse, an ua lávina Erutercánon náve nancarna ettesse Yerusalémo.
Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those that have been sent to her – how often I wanted to gather your children like a hen gathers her young under her wings! But you did not want to.	Yerúsalem, Yerúsalem, ye nahta i Erutercánor ar sarya i anaier mentaine senna – manen rimbave mernen comya hínalyar ve poroce comya nessaryar nu rámaryat! Mal ualde merne.
Behold, your house is abandoned to yourselves! I tell you that you will by no means see me until you say: Blessed is who is coming in the name of the Lord!”	Yé, coalda ná hehtaina elden! Nyarin lenna i laume cenuvalde ni tenna quetilde: Aistana ná ye túla mí Héruo esse!”
And on an occasion when he went into a house of a chief of the Pharisees to eat bread, they watched him closely.	Ar mi lú íre lendes mir coa turcova i Farisaron matien masta, tirneltes harive.
And behold! was there a man before him who was swollen, having too much water in his body.	Ar yé! enge tasse nér epe se ye náne púlienwa, arwa acca olya neno hroaryasse.
Therefore Jesus spoke to the lawyers, saying: “Is it allowed on the day of rest to heal, or not?”	Etta Yésus carampe i şanyengolmonnar, quétala: “Ma ná lávina i sendaresse nesta, hya lá?”
But they were silent. Then he took the man, healed him and sent him away.	Mal anelte quilde. Tá nampes i nér, nestane se ar mentane se oa.
And he said to them: “Who among you, if his son or his ox falls into a well, does not pull him up on the day of rest?”	Ar quentes téna: “Man mici le, qui yondorya hya mundorya lanta mir tampo, ua tucuva se ama i sendaresse?”
And they could not answer these things.	Ar ualte pole hanquete nati sine.
Then he told a comparison to the men that were invited, when he perceived how they close the most prominent places for themselves, saying to them:	Tá nyarnes sestie i nerin i náner tultaine, íre túnes manen cillelte i amminde nómi inten, quétala téna:
“When you are summoned by a person to a wedding, do not lie down at the most prominent place. Perhaps a person more prominent than you has been invited by him,	“Íre nalde tultaine lo quén veryanwenna, áva caita undu i amminda nómesse. Cé quén minda lá elye anaie tultaina lo se,
and the person who summoned you will come and say to you: 'Allow this man to have the place!' And then it is necessary for you to go humbled to the lowest place.	ar i quén ye lye-tultane tuluva ar quetuva lyenna: 'Lava nér sinan same i nóme!' Ar tá mauya lyen mene nucumna i amnalda nómenna.
But when you are invited, go and lie at the lowliest place. Thus, when the man who invited you comes, he will say to you: 'Friend, come up, higher!' Then you will have glory before the people that have been invited with you.	Mal íre nalye tultaina, mena ar á caita i amnalda nómesse. Sie, íre i nér ye tultane lye tule, quetuvas lyenna: 'Meldo, tula ama, ambe inga!' Tá samuval alcar epe ilye i queni i anaier tultaine aselye.
For everyone who raises himself will be humbled, but who humbles himself will be raised up.”	An ilquen ye orta inse nauva nucumna, mal ye nucume inse nauva ortaina.”
Furthermore, he said to who invited him: “When you make an evening meal or a supper, do not summon your friends, or your brothers, or the people of your kin, or your rich neighbors. Perhaps they also will invite you again, and that will be for you a paying back.	Ente, quentes yenna tultane se: “Íre caril şinyemat hya ahtumat, áva tulta meldolyar, hya hánolyar, hya i queni nosselyo, hya lárie armarolyar. Cé yando té tultuvar lyé ata, ar ta nauva lyen nampaityale.
But when you make a feast, invite poor ones, cripples, lame ones, blind ones,	Mal íre caril merende, á tulta penyar, hroaloicali, úlévimar, cénelórar,
and you will be happy, for they have nothing with which it is possible for them to repay you. For will be repaid to you in the rising of dead!”	ar nauval valima, an té samir munta yanen ece tien paitya lyen. An nauva paityaina lyen qualinion ortiesse!”
Hearing that, one among who lay at the table said: “Happy is who eats bread in God's kingdom!”	Hlárala ta, quén mici i cainer ara i sarno quente: “Valima ná ye mate massa mi Eruo aranie!”
Jesus said to him: “ was a man who prepared a great supper, and he invited numerous ones.	Yésus quente senna: “Enge nér ye manwane túra ahtumat, ar tultanes rimbali.
And he sent his servant at the hour of the supper, to say to who were invited: “Come, for now everything is ready!”	Ar mentanes núrorya i ahtumatto lúmesse, quetien innar náner tultaine: “Tula, an sí ilqua manwa ná!”
But all among them started to give reasons not to come. The first said to him: 'I have bought a field, and it is necessary for me to go to see it. I beg of you, do not think evil about me since it is not possible for me to come!'	Mal illi mici te yestaner anta castali uien tule. I minya quente senna: 'Amancien imnin resta, ar mauya nin lelya cenien sa. Iquin lyello, áva sana ulco pa ni pan ua ece nin tule!'
And another said: 'I have traded to myself five yokes of oxes, and I am going to test them. I beg of you, do not think evil about me since it is not possible for me to come.'	Ar exe quente: 'Amancien imnin yantar lempe mundoron, ar ménan tyastien te. Iquin lyello, áva sana ulco pa ni pan ua ece nin tule.'
And another said: 'I have married a woman, and therefore it is not possible for me to come.'	Ar exe quente: 'Evérien nissenna, ar etta ua ece nin tule.'
When he returned, the thrall told these things to his lord. Then the chief of the house was angry and said to his thrall: 'Go with speed into the streets and ways in the city, and bring here the poor ones and cripples and blind ones and lame ones!'	Íre nanwennes, i mól nyarne nati sine heruryanna. Tá i cavo turco náne rúşea ar quente mólyanna: 'Mena lintiénen mir i maller ar tier i ostosse, ar á tala sir i penyar ar hroaloicar ar cénelórar ar úlévimar!'
And the thrall said: “Lord, what you commanded has been done, and still is place.”	Ar i mól quente: “Heru, ya cannel anaie carna, ar en ea nóme.”
And the lord said to the thrall: “Go out into the roads and to the fenced fields and compel them to come inside, in order to fill my house.	Ar i heru quente i mólenna: “Á etelelya mir i maller ar i pelerinnar ar áten mauya tule minna, quatien coanya.
For I say to you : No one among the men that were invited will taste my supper!'”	An quetin lenna: Úquen imíca i neri i náner tultaine tyavuvar ahtumattinya!'”
Now great crowds were travelling with him, and he turned and said to them:	Sí hoe şangali lelender óse, ar quernes inse ar quente téna:
“If anyone comes to me and does not hate his father and his mother and his wife and his sisters, indeed his own life, is not possible for him to be my disciple.	“Qui aiquen tule ninna ar ua teve atarya ar amillerya ar verirya ar hínaryar ar hánoryar ar néşaryar, é véra cuilerya, ua ece sen náve hildonya.
To who is not carrying his cross and coming after me, it is not possible to be my disciple.	Yen ua cóla tarwerya ar túla apa ni, ua ece náve hildonya.
For who among you that wishes to build a tower does not first sit down to calculate the sum of building, to know if he as enough money to complete it?	An man mici le i mere carasta mindo ua minyave hame undu onotien i nonwe carastiéno, istien qui samis fárea telpe telien sa?
If he does not, perhaps he puts the foundation of the tower , but it is not possible for him to complete it, and all that are watching will perhaps start to speak mockery about him,	Qui laias, cé panyas i mindo talma, mal ua ece sen telya i mindo, ar ilye i tírar cé yestuvar quete yaiwe pa se,
saying: 'This man started to build, but it was not possible for him to finish.'	quétala: 'Nér sina yestane carasta, mal ua ence sen telya.'
Or who is the king who will meet another king at war and does not first sit down to make a consideration whether he can with ten thousand warriors fight against who comes against him having twenty thousands?	Hya man ná i aran ye veluva hyana aran ohtasse ar ua minyave hame undu carien úvie qui polis ohtarinen húmi quean mahta yenna tule senna arwa húmi yúquean?
If he cannot fight against him, he sends people who will speak on his behalf while the other is still far away, seeking peace.	Qui uas pole mahta senna, mentas queni i quetuvar rá sen íre i exe en haira ná, cestala raine.
Thus, therefore, no one among you that does not say farewell to all his goods can be my disciple.	Sie, etta, úquen mici le ye ua quete namárie ilye armaryannar pole náve hildonya.
Salt is indeed good, but if the taste of the salt is gone, with what will one give it taste again?	Singe é ná mára, mal qui i singeo tyáve nauva vanwa, mananen mo antuva san tyáve ata?
It is not good for soil or as manure alike. People throw it outside. Let who has ears to listen, listen!	Uas mára cemnen hya ve múco véla. Queni hatir sa ettenna. Lava yen same hlaru lastien, lasta!
All the tax collectors and sinners came near to him to hear him.	Ilye i tungwemor ar úcarindor túler hare senna hlarien se.
Therefore the Pharisees and the lawyers grumbled, saying: “This man receives sinners and eats with them!”	Etta i Farisar ar i şanyengolmor nurruner, quétala: “Nér sina came úcarindor ar mate aselte!”
Then he spoke this comparison to them:	Tá quentes sestie sina téna:
“Who is the man among you having a hundred sheep who does not, if one among them is lost, leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness and will seek the lost sheep until he finds it?	“Man ná i nér mici le arwa mámaron tuxa ye ua, qui er mici te ná vanwa, hehtuva i nerte neterquean i erumasse ar cestuva i vanwa máma tenna hirises?
And after finding it he will put it on his back, having joy.	Ar apa hirie se panyuvas se pontiryasse, arwa alasseo.
And after coming home he summons his friends and his neighbors and says to them: 'Be happy with me, for I have found my sheep, that was lost.'	Ar apa tulie marda tultas meldoryar ar armaroryar ar quete téna: 'Na valime asinye, an ihírien mámanya, ye náne vanwa.'
I say to you that in the same manner, when one sinner finds repentance, is in heaven a joy greater than which is concerning ninety-nine sinners that do not have need of repentance.	Quetin lenna i mí imya lé, íre er úcarindo hire inwis, ea menelde alasse túra lá ya ea pa úcarindor nerte neterquean i uar same maure inwisteva.
Or who is the woman who has ten drachmas who does not kindle a lamp and clean her house if one of them is lost, seeking closely until she finds it?	Hya man ná i nís ye same racmar quean ye ua narta calma ar poita coarya qui er mici tai ná vanwa, cestala harive tenna hirises?
And when she has found it, she gathers her friends and says: 'Be happy with me, for I have found the drachma that was lost to me!'	Ar íre sa-ihíries, comyas melderyar ar armareryar ar quete: 'Na valime asinye, an ihírien i racma ya náne vanwa nin!'
Thus, I say to you, will be joy among God's angels concerning one sinner who finds repentance.”	Sie, quetin lenna, euva alasse mici Eruo valar pa er úcarindo ye hire inwis.”
Then he said: “ was a man with whom were two sons.	Tá quentes: “Enge nér as ye enget yondo atta.
And the younger among them said to his father: “Father, give me the part of the goods that falls to my portion.” Then he divided his livelihood to them .	Ar i ambe nessa mici tu quente ataryanna: “Atar, ánin anta i ranta i armaron ya lanta massenyan.” Tá ciltanes laulestarya tún.
Thereafter, after not many days, the younger son gathered everything and went away into a remote land, and here he threw away his money on a wild life.	Epeta, apa lá rimbe auri, i ambe nessa yondo comyane ilqua ar lende oa mir haira nóre, ar tasse hantes oa telperya verca coiviesse.
After he used everything, was a severe famine in that land, and he began to have need.	Apa yuhtanes ilqua enge urda saicele nóre tanasse, ar yestanes same maure.
He went attaching himself to one of the people that lived in that land, who sent him into his fields to watch pigs.	Lendes himyala er i quenion i marner nóre tanasse, ye mentane se mir restaryar tirien polcar.
And he wished to fill himself with the pods that the pigs were eating, but no one gave him a thing.	Ar mernes quate inse i vainínen yar i polcar manter, mal úquen antane sen nat.
But when he returned to keenness of perception he said: 'All the paid people that work for my father have an abundance of bread, while I am dying from famine!	Mal íre nanwennes laicenna quentes: “Ilye i paityane queni i molir atarinyan samir úve massava, íre inye quéla saicelénen!
I will rise and I will go to my father, and I will say to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you.	Ortuvan ar lelyuvan atarinyanna, ar quetuvan senna: Atar, úacárien menelenna ar tyenna.
I am not worthy to still be called your son, but make me like one of the paid people that work for you.'	Uan valda en náven estaina yondotya, mal áni care ve er i paityane quenion i molir tyen.'
And he arose and came to his father. When he was still far away, the father saw him, and his heart went out to him, and running to him he fell upon his neck and kissed him.	Ar orontes ar túle ataryanna. Íre en anes haiya, i atar cenne se, ar endarya etelende senna, ar nórala senna lantanes axeryanna ar minque se.
But the son said: 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you.	Mal i yondo quente: 'Atar, úacárien menelenna ar tyenna.
I am not worthy to still be called your son. Make me like one of the paid people that work for you.'	Uan valda en náven estaina yondotya. Áni care ve er i paityane quenion i molir tyen.'
But the father said to his servants: 'Quickly, bring a cloak, the best one, and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet,	Ono i atar quente núroryannar: 'Lintave, á tala colla, i arya, ar ása panya sesse, ar á panya corma máryasse ar hyapat taluryatse,
and bring the fattened young bull, kill it and let us eat and have joy!	ar á tala i maitana nessa mundo, áse nahta ar alve mate ar same alasse!
For this son of mine was dead and has come back to life; he was lost and has been found!' And they began to have joy.	An yondonya sina náne qualin ar enutúlie coivienna; anes vanwa ar anaie hírina!' Ar yestanelte same alasse.
But his older brother was in the field, and when he came and went near to the house, he heard music and people dancing.	Mal ambe yára hánorya náne i restasse, ar íre túles ar lende hare i coanna, hlasses lindale ar quelli liltala.
He called one of the servants and asked about what these things meant.	Yalles er i núrion ar maquente pa mana nati sine tenger.
He said to him: 'Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fattened young bull, since he received him back in good health.'	Quentes senna: 'Hánolya utúlie, ar atarelya anahtie i maitana nessa mundo, pan nanacámies se málesse.'
But he was angry and did not wish to go in. Then his father came outside and asked of him .	Mal anes rúşea ar ua merne mene minna. Tá atarya túle ettenna ar arcane sello.
In answer he said to his father: 'Through so many years I have toiled for you, and your command I did not ever break, and yet you did not give me a young goat for me to have joy with my friends.	Hanquentasse quentes ataryanna: 'Ter ta rimbe loar omótien tyen, ar canwatya uan oi rance, ananta uatye oi antane nin nessa naico samienyan alasse as meldonyar.
But when this son of yours has come who devoured your livelihood with whores, you kill the fattened young bull for him!'	Mal íre utúlie yondotya sina ye ammante laulestatya as imbacindeli, nahtatye i maitana mundo sen!'
Then he said to him: 'Child, you have always been with me, and all mine are yours,	Tá quentes senna: 'Hína, illume anaietye asinye, ar ilye ninyar nar tyenyar,
but it was necessary to a have joy and be glad, for this brother of yours was dead and returned to life, and he was lost and has been found!”	mal mauyane same alasse ar náve valime, an sina hánotya náne qualin ar nanwenne coivienna, ar anes vanwa ar anaie hírina!”
Then he said also to his disciples: “ was a man who was rich and had a person overseeing his house, but he heard a bad report about him – that he threw away his goods.	Tá quentes yando hildoryannar: “Enge atan ye náne lárea ar sáme quén ortírala coarya, mal hlasses ulca nyarie pa se – i hantes oa armaryar.
Therefore he summoned him and said to him: 'What is this thing that I hear about you? Give a reckoning about your work as a steward, for you will not manage the house more.'	Etta se-tultanes ar quente senna: 'Mana nat sina ya hlarin pa lye? Á anta onótie pa molierya ve mardil, an ualye mahtuva i coa ambe.'
Then the steward saod to himself: 'What am I to do, now when my lord is wishing to take away my work as steward? My strength does not suffice for digging. I shall be humiliated if it is necessary for me to beg.	Tá i mardil quente insenna: 'Mana caruvan, sí íre herunya méra mapa oa molienya ve mardil? Poldorenya ua farya sapien. Nauvan nucumna qui mauya nin ique.
But I know what I will do, causing people to receive me into their houses when my overseership is taken from me!'	Mal istan mana caruvan, tyárala queni came ni mir coaltar íre ortírienya ná mapaina nillo!'
And summoning to himself the entire group of debtors of his lord, he said to the first: 'What is the sum of your debt to my lord?'	Ar yálala insenna i quanda rohtalie heruryo, quentes i minyanna: 'Mana i nonwe rohtalyo herunyan?'
He said: 'A hundred measures of oil.' He said to him: 'Take your papers and sit down and quickly write fifty!'	Eques: 'Lestar tuxa ilmava.' Quentes senna: 'Á mapa hyalinilyar ar hama undu ar lintave teca lepenquean!'
Thereafter he said to another: 'And you, what is the sum of your debt?' He said: 'A hunded cor measures of grain.' He said to him: 'Take your papers and write eighty!'	Epeta quentes exenna: 'Ar elye, mana i nonwe rohtalyo?' Quentes: 'Cor-lestar tuxa oriva.' Quentes senna: 'Á mapa hyalinelyar ar teca toloquean!'
And the lord praised the unjust steward, since he behaved wisely – for in their generation, the sons of this age are wiser than the sons of light.	Ar i heru laitane i úfaila mardil, pan lenganes sailave –an nónareltasse, randa sino yondor nar saile lá i calo yondor.
Furthermore, I say to you: Make friends for yourselves with the unrighteous riches! . Thus, when that fails, they will receive you into the eternal dwellings.	Ente, quetin lenna: Cara meldor elden i úfaila larnen! Sie, íre ta loita, le-camuvalte mir i oire mardi.
The person who is faithful in that which is smallest, is faithful also in much, and the person who is unrighteous in that which is smallest, is unrighteous also in much.	I quén ye ná voronda mi ta ya ná ampitya, ná voronda yando olyasse, ar i quén ye ná úfaila mi ta ya ná ampitya, ná úfaila yando mi olya.
Therefore, if you are not faithful concerning the unrighteous riches, who will put in your keeping that which is true?	Etta, qui ualde voronde pa i úfaila lar, man panyuva hepieldasse ta ya nanwa ná?
And if you have not shown your faithfulness concerning that which is another's, who will give you anything that is to be your own?	Ar qui ualde atánie voronwelda pa ta ya ná exeva, man antuva len aiqua ya nauva véralda?
 is not servant to whom it is possible to be a slave for two lords, for he will hate one and love the other, or he will stick to one and despise the other. It is not possible for you to be slaves for God and for riches alike.”	Ua ea núro yen ece náve mól heru attan, an tevuvas er ar meluva i exe, hya himyuvas er ar nattiruva i exe. Ua ece len náve móli Erun ar laren véla.”
But the Pharisees, that loved money, listened to all these things, and they spoke to him with mockery.	Mal i Farisar, i méler telpe, lastaner ilye sine natinnar, ar carampelte senna yaiwenen.
And he said to them: “You are that say that you are just before men, but God knows the heart of all. For that which is sublime to men is disgusting to God.	Ar quentes téna: “Elde nar i quetir i nalde faile epe atani, mal Eru ista illion enda. An ta ya ná varanda atanin ná yelwa Erun.
The Law and the Prophets were until John; from then one makes the gospel known, and all are pressing towards it.	I Şanye ar i Erutercánor náner tenna Yoháno; ho tá mo care i evandilyon sinwa, ar illi nírar sanna.
Heaven and earth will pass away before a single mark in the Law will fall away.	Menel cemenye autuvat nó erya tehta i Şanyesse lantuva oa.
Everyone who separates himself from his wife and gets married to another, violates marriage, and who gets married to a woman divorsed from her husband, violates marriage.	Ilquen ye cilta inse veriryallo ar verya exenna, race vestale, ar ye verya nissenna ciltaina veruryallo, race vestale.
But was a man who was rich, and he covered himself with purple and linen, having joy every day in a glorious manner.	Mal enge nér ye náne lárea, ar tompes inse luicarninen ar páşenen, arwa alasseo ilya auresse mi alcarinqua lé.
But was a beggar whose name was Lazarus, placed by his gate, full of ulcers.	Mal enge iquindo yeo esse náne Lásaro, panyaina ara andorya, quanta sistelínen.
He wished to be filled with that fell from the rich man's table, but also the dogs came and licked his ulcers.	Mernes náve quátina yainen lantaner sarnollo i lárea nerwa, mal yando i huor túler ar láver sisteryar.
It happened that the beggar died, and the angels carried him away to the bosom of Abraham. Furthermore, also the rich man died and was brought to his grave.	Túle i qualle i iquindo, ar i valar colle se oa Avrahámo súmanna. Ente, yando i lárea nér qualle ar náne talaina sapsaryanna.
And he opened his eyes in Mandos , where he existed in torments, and he saw Abraham far away and Lazarus in his bosom.	Ar latyanes henyat mi Mandos, yasse enges ñwalmelissen, ar cennes Avraham haiya ar Lásaro sumaryasse.
Therefore he cried and said: 'Father Abraham, have mercy on me and send Lazarus, for him to put the tip of his finger in water, to make my tongue cold! For I am tormented in this fire!”	Etta yámes ar quente: 'Atar Avraham, órava nisse ar á menta Lásaro, panieryan leperyo tille nenesse, carien lambanya ringa! An nanye ñwalyaina náre sinasse!”
But Abraham said: “Child, recall that you received your good things in your life, and Lazarus in the same manner the bad things; but now he receives comfort here, but you have pain.	Mal Avraham quente: “Hína, enyala i camnel máre natilyar coivielyasse, ar Lásaro mí imya lé i úmáre nati; mal sí camis tiutale sisse, mal elye same naicele.
And beside all these things, a big cleft has been placed between us and you Thus that wish to go from here to you are not able; in the same manner people are not able to pass from there to us.”	Ar ara ilye nati sine, hoa cilya anaie panyaina imbi elme ar elde. Sie i merir lelya silo lenna uar pole; mi imya lé queni uar pole lahta talo menna.”
But he said: “Then I ask of you, father: Send him to my father's house –	Mal eques: “Tá arcan lyello, atar: Áse menta i coanna atarinyava –
for I have five brothers – for him to witness to them, to stop them as well from coming to this place of torment!”	an samin hánor lempe – vettieryan tien, pustien yando té tuliello nóme sinanna ñwalmeva!”
But Abraham said: “They have Moses and the Prophets; let them listen to them!”	Ono eque Avraham: “Samilte Móses ar i Erutercánor; á lastar téna!”
But he said: “No, father Abraham, but if a person will come to them from the dead, they will find repentance!”	Mal sé quente: “Vá, atar Avraham, mal qui quén tuluva téna qualinillon, hiruvalte inwis!”
But he said to them: “If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, a person returning from dead will also fail to change their mind.”	Ono quentes senna: “Qui ualte lasta Mósenna ar i Erutercánonnar, quén nanwénala qualinillon yando loituva vista sámalta.”
Then Jesus said to his disciples: “It is necessary that the reasons for falling come, but woe to the person that they come through!	Tá Yésus quente hildoryannar: “Mauya i tulir i castar lantiéva, mal horro i quenen ter ye tulilte!
If a stone of grinding was put around his nect, and he was thrown into the sea, that was to him better than causing the fall of one among these little ones!	Qui ondo muliéva náne panyaina os axerya, ar anes hátina mir i ear, ta náne sen arya lá tyarie i lante ero mici pityar sine!
Take heed of yourselves! If your brother sins, rebuke him, and if he has a change of mind, forgive him.	Cima inde! Qui hánolya úcare, áse naitya, ar qui samis inwis, ásen apsene.
And if seven times in a single day he sins against you and he returns to you seven times, saying: 'I have a change of mind!', forgive him!	Ar qui lúr otso mi erya aure úcaris lyenna ar nanwenis lyenna lúr otso, quétala, 'Samin inwis!', ásen apsene!
And the apostles said to the Lord: “Give us more faith!”	Ar i aposteli quenter i Herunna: “Ámen anta amba savie!”
But the Lord said: “If you had faith like a seed of mustard, you could say to this mulberry tree : 'Pull up your roots and be planted in the sea' – and it was going to do according to your saying.	Mal i Heru quente: “Qui sámelde savie ve erde sinapio, pollelde quete morpialda sinanna: 'Tuca ama şundulyar ar na empánina i earesse' – ar carumnes ve quetielda.
But who among you, having a thrall who works with the plow or as a shepherd, will say to him when he comes from the field: 'Come here quickly and lie down at the table'?	Mal man mici le, arwa mólo ye mole i hyarnen hya ve mavar, quetuva senna íre tulis i restallo: 'Tula sir lintiénen ar á caita undu ara i sarno'?
Will he not sooner say to him: 'Prepare me something for my supper, and bind around your hips and serve me until I have eaten and drunk, and thereafter you may eat and drink' – ?	Ma uas ambe rato quetuva senna: 'Ánin manwa nat ahtumattinyan, ar nuta os oşwelya ar nura nin tenna amátien ar usúcien, ar epeta elye lerta mate ar suce' – ?
Surely he does not think that he has a debt to the thrall since he indeed did the things that he received orders about?	Lau sanas i samis rohta i mólen pan é carnes i nati pa yar camnes canwali?
Thus also yourselves: After you have done all the things that you received orders about, say: 'We are useless slaves. We have done what our debt was.'	Sie yando elde: Apa acárielde ilye i nati pa yar camnelde canwali, queta: 'Nalve úaşie móli. Acárielve ya rohtalva náne.'”
And on his journey towards Jerusalem he passed though the middle of Samaria and Galilee.	Ar lendaryasse Yerúsalemenna langanes ter i ende Samário ar Alileo.
And when he came into a village, ten skin-diseased men met him, but they stopped far away from him.	Ar íre túles mir masto, helmahlaiwe neri quean veller se, mal pustanelte haire sello.
And they raised their voice and said: “Jesus, teacher, have mercy on us!”	Ar ortanelte ómalta ar quente: “Yésus, peantar, órava messe!”
And when he saw them he said to them: “Go and show yourselves to the priests.” Then, as they were on the road, they were cleansed.	Ar íre cennes te quentes téna: “Mena ar á tana inde i airimoin.” Tá, íre anelte i tiesse, anelte poitaine.
One among them returned when he saw that he was healed, and in a great voice he gave glory to God.	Er mici te nanwenne íre cennes i anes nestaina, ar hoa ómanen antanes alcar Erun.
And he fell upon his face before Jesus' feet and thanked him; he was a Samaritan man.	Ar lantanes cendeleryanna epe Yésuo talu ar hantane sen; anes Samárea nér.
In answer Jesus said: “Were not the ten healed? Where, then, are the other nine?	Hanquentasse Yésus quente: “Ma únelte i quean nestaine? Masse, tá, nar i hyane nerte?
Was there no one who returned to give glory to God, except this man from another nation?”	Ma enge úquen ye nanwenne antien alcar Erun, hequa nér sina hyana nórello?”
And he said to him: “Rise and go; by your faith you have received health.”	Ar quentes senna: “Á orta ar mena; savielyanen acámiel mále.”
But when he was asked by the Pharisees about the time when God's kingdom was going to come, he said to them in answer: “God's kingdom does not come in a manner allowing people to see it with their eyes.	Mal íre anes maquétina lo i Farisar pa i lúme yasse Eruo aranie tulumne, quentes téna hanquentasse: “Eruo aranie ua tule mi lé lávala quenin cenitas hendultanten.
Furthermore, people will not say: 'See here!' or 'There!' For behold, God's kingdom exists in your midst.”	Ente, queni uar quetuva: 'Cena sisse!' hya 'Tasse!' An yé, Eruo aranie ea endeldasse.”
Then he said to the disciples: “ will come days when you will wish to see one of the days of the Son of Man, but you will not see it.	Tá quentes i hildonnar: “Tuluvar aureli yassen meruvalde cene er i aurion i Atanyondova, mal ualde cenuva sa.
And people will say to you: 'See there!' or 'See here!' Do not go there and do not run behind them.	Ar queni quetuvar lenna: 'Cena tasse!', hya: 'Cena sisse!' Áva lelya tar ar áva nore ca te.
For like the flash , shining from one part under heaven to another part under heaven, so the Son of Man will be.	An ve i íta, caltala er rantallo nu menel hyana rantanna nu menel, sie i Atanyondo nauva.
But firstly it is necessary for him to suffer much and to be turned away by this generation.	Mal minyave mauya sen perpere ole ar náve quérina oa lo nónare sina.
Furthermore, like it happened in the days of Noah, so it will be also in the days of the Son of Man:	Ente, ve martane auressen Noaho, sie euva yando i Atanyondo auressen:
They ate, they drank, men married, women were given in marriage, until the day when Noah went into the ark, and hte flood came and destroyed them all.	Mantelte, suncelte, neri veryaner, nissi náner vertaine, tenna i aure yasse Noah lende mir i marcirya, ar i oloire túle ar nancarne te illi.
In the same manner, as it happened in the days of Lot: they ate, they drank, they traded, they bought, they planted, they built.	Mí imya lé, ve martane auressen Loto: mantelte, suncelte, mancanelte, vancelte, empannelte, carastanelte.
But on the day when Lot went out from Sodom, fire and brimstone fell from heaven and destroyed them all.	Mal i auresse yasse Lot ettúle Soromello, náre ar ussar lantaner menello ar nancarne te illi.
In the same manner it will be when the Son of Man shall be revealed.	Mí imya lé euva íre i Atanyondo nauva apantaina.
In that day it is necessary for the person on top of his house, who has his goods in the house, not to go down to fetch them, and int he same manner it is necessary for the person in the field not to return to the things behind him.	Enta auresse mauya i quenen tópasse coaryava, ye same armaryar i coasse, lá mene undu tultien tai, ar mi imya lé mauya i quenen i restasse lá nanwene i natinnar ca se.
Recall the wife of Lot!	Enyala Loto veri!
To anyone who seeks to keep his life it will be lost, but a person it is lost to, will save it.	Aiquenen ye cesta hepe cuilerya nauvas vanwa, mal quén yen nas vanwa rehtuva sa.
I tell you: In that night two will be in one bed; one will be brought , but the other will be abandoned.	Nyarin lenna: Mi enta lóme atta euvat er caimasse; er nauva talaina, mal i exe nauva hehtaina.
 will be two women grinding on the same mill; one will be brought along, but the other will be abandoned. 	Euva nís atta múlala i imya mulmanen; er nauva talaina, mal i exe nauva hehtaina. 
And in answer they said to him: “Where, Lord?” He said to them: “Where the body is, there the eagles will gather.”	Ar hanquentasse quentelte senna: “Masse, Heru?” Quentes téna: “Yasse i hroa ea, tasse i şorni ocomuvar.”
Then he told them a comparision about the need of praying and not stop trying,	Tá nyarnes tien sestie pa i maure hyamiéva ar lá pustiéva neve,
saying: “In a city was a judge who did nto have fear of God and did not have respect for man.	quétala: “Ostosse enge námo ye ua sáme rucie Eruva ar ua sáme áya atanen.
But was a widowed woman in that city and she came to the judge, saying: “Give me justice from my opponent at law!”	Mal enge verulóra nís sana ostosse ar túles i námonna, quétala: “Ánin anta failie cotumonyallo şanyesse!”
But for a time he did not want, but thereafter he said to himself: “Though I do not fear God or have respect for man,	Mal ter lúme uas merne, mal epeta quentes insenna: “Ómu uan ruce Erullo hya same áya atanen,
I will still bring justice to this woman, or she will come and strike me in the face!”	en taluvan failie nís sinan, hya tuluvas ni-petien i cendelesse!”
Then the Lord said: “Hear what this unjust judge is saying!	Tá i Heru quente: “Hlara ya úfaila námo sina quéta!
Will God not cause justice to be done to those that he has chosen that cry to him at day and night, though he has patience concerning them?	Ma Eru ua tyaruva failie náve carna in icílies i yamir senna mi aure yo lóme, ómu samis cóle pa te?
I tell you, he will give them justice soon! And yet, when the Son of Man shall come, will he find the faith on earth?””	Nyarin lenna, antuvas ten failie rato! Ananta, íre i Atanyondo tuluva, ma hiruvas i savie cemende?”
He also spoke this comparison to that were certain about their own justice and counted the others as nothing:	Yando quentes sestie sina innar náner tance pa véra failielta ar nonter i exi ve munta:
“Two men went up into the temple to pray. One was a Pharisee and one was a tax collector.	“Nér atta lendet ama mir i corda hyamien. Er náne Farisa ar er náne tungwemo.
The Pharisee stood alone and prayed thus: 'O God, I give you thanks since I am not like other men, robbers, unrighteous ones, people who violate marriage, or like this tax collector.	I Farisa tarne eressea ar hyamne sie: 'A Eru, antan lyen hantale pan uan ve hyane atani, pilur, úfailar, queni i racir vestale, hya ve tungwemo sina.
I fast two times in a week, and of all things that I get I give a tenth .'	Avamatin lú atta i otsolasse, ar ilye nation yar ñetin antan quaista.'
But the tax collector also did not wish to raise his eyes towards heaven, but he beat his breast, saying: 'O God, have mercy on me, a sinner!'	Mal i tungwemo yando ua merne orta henyat menelenna, mal palpanes ambosterya, quétala: 'A Eru, órava nisse, úcarindo!'
I say to you: This man went home being more righteous than the other, for everyone that exalts himself will be humbled, but he who humbles himself will be exalted.”	Quetin lenna: Nér sina lende marda nála faila lá i exe, an ilquen ye orta inse nauva nucumna, mal sé ye nucume inse nauva ortaina.”
Now people brought to him their babies for him to touch them, but when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them.	Sí queni taller senna vinimoltar appieryan te, mal íre i hildor cenner sa, naityaneltet.
But Jesus called them and said: “Allow the children to come to me, and do not stop them, for God's kingdom is for suchlike ones.	Mal Yésus yalle te ar quente: “Lava i hínain tule ninna, ar áva pusta te, an Eruo aranie taitin ná.
Truly I say to you: Anyone who does not receive God's kingdom as a child , will by no means come into it.”	Násie quetin lenna: Aiquen ye ua came Eruo aranie ve hína, laume tuluva mir sa.”
And one of the rulers said asked him: “Good teacher, what am I to do to be heir to eternal life?”	Ar er i cánoron maquente senna: “Mane peantar, mana caruvan náve aryon oira coiviéno?”
Jesus said to him: “How is that you call me good? No one is good except one, God.	Yésus quente senna: “Manen ná i estal ní mane? Úquen ná mane hequa er, Eru.
You know the commandments: Do not violate marriage. Do not kill. Do not steal. Do not witness with a lie. Give glory to your fatehr and to your mother.”	Istal i canwar: Áva race vestale. Áva nahta. Áva pile. Áva vetta hurunen. Á anta alcar atarelyan ar amillelyan.”
Then he said: “All these things I have kept from youth.”	Tá quentes: “Ilye nati sine ehépien et néşello.”
Hearing that, Jesus said to him: “ is still one thing that you lack. Sell everything that you have and distribute the money to poor ones, and you will have a treasure in heaven; then come and follow me.”	Hlárala ta, Yésus quente senna: “Ea en er nat ya penil. Vaca ilqua ya samil ar etsata i telpe penyain, ar samuval harma menelde; tá tula ar áni hilya.”
When he heard that, he had deep grief, for he was very rich.	Íre hlasses ta, sámes tumna nyére, an anes ita lárea.
Jesus look at him and said: “How difficult is for that have money to come into God's kingdom!	Yésus yente se ar quente: “Manen urda ná in samir telpe tule mir Eruo aranie!
Indeed for a camel to pass through a needle's eye is easier than coming into God's kingdom for a rich person!”	É ulumpen autie ter nelmo assa ná aşcárima lá tulie mir Eruo aranie lárea quenen.”
 that heard that said: “Then who can be saved?”	I hlasser ta quenter: “Tá man pole náve rehtaina?”
He said: “The impossible things to men are possible to God.”	Eques: “I úcárimar atanin nar cárime Erun.”
But Peter said: “Behold, we have abandoned our own things and have followed you.”	Mal eque Péter: “Yé, ehehtielme vére natilmar ar ihílier lye.”
He said to him: “Truly I say to you, there is no man who has abandoned house or wife or brothers or parents for God's kingdom	Quentes téna: “Násie quetin lenna, ea úner ye ehehtie coa hya veri hya hánor hya nostaru Eruo aranien
who will not receive back many times more in this time, and in the coming age eternal life.”	ye ua nancamuva rimbe lúli amba lúme sinasse, ar i túlala randasse oira coivie.”
Then he brought the twelve away to a private place and said to them: “Behold! We are going up to Jerusalem, and all the things written by the prophets about the Son of Man will be completed.	Tá talles i yunque oa véra nómenna ar quente téna: “Yé! Ménalve ama Yerusalemenna, ar ilye i nati técine lo i Erutercánor pa i Atanyondo nauvar telyaine.
For he will be given over to people of the nations and will suffer mockery and violence, and one will spit upon him,	An nauvas antaina ollo quellin i nórion ar perperuva yaiwe ar orme, ar mo piutuva senna,
and after flaying him they will kill him, but on the third day he will rise.”	ar apa riptie se nahtuvaltes, mal i neldea auresse ortuvas.”
But they understood nothing of these things, but this saying was hidden from them, and they did not know the things said.	Mal hanyanelte munta sine nation, mal quetie sina náne nurtaine tello, ar ualte sinte i nati quétine.
Now, when he came near to Jericho, a blind man sat by the road, begging.	Sí, íre túles hare Yericonna, cénelóra nér hamne ara i malle, íquala.
Since he hard the crowd on the move, he asked about what this meant.	Pan hlasses i şanga léva, maquentes pa mana si tenge.
They told him: “Jesus from Nazareth is passing by!”	Nyarnelte sen: “Yésus Násaretello langea!”
And he cried , saying: “Jesus son of David, have mercy on me!”	Ar yámes, quétala: “Yésus Lavirion, órava nisse!”
And those that went in front of Jesus rebuked him, for him to be silent, but that much more he cried: “Son of David, have mercy on me!”	Ar i lender opo Yésus naityaner se, náveryan quilda, mal ta ole ambe yámes: “Lavirion, órava nisse!”
Then Jesus stopped and commanded that they were to bring the man to him. After he came near, Jesus said:	Tá Yésus pustane ar canne i tulyumnelte i ner senna. Apa túles hare, Yésus quente:
“What do you want that I am to do for you?” He said: “Lord, allow me to receive sight!”	“Mana meril i caruvan lyen?” Eques: “Heru, ánin lave came céne!”
And Jesus said: “Receive sight; by your faith you have received sight.”	Ar eque Yésus: “Cama céne; savielyanen acámiel céne.”
And in the same moment he received sight, and he followed Jesus, giving glory to God. And the entire people, seeing that, gave praise to God.	Ar mi imya lú camnes céne, ar hilyanes Yésus, antala alcar Erun. Ar i quanda lie, cénala ta, antane laitale Erun.
And when he came into the city, he went through Jericho.	Ar íre túles mir i osto, lendes ter Yerico.
And was there a man whose name was Zacchaeus, and he was a chief tax collector and rich.	Ar enge tasse nér yeo esse náne Saccaio, ar anes héra tungwemo ar lárea.
And he tried to see Jesus, but he could not because of the crowd, and he was not tall.	Ar néves cene Yésus, mal uas polle i şanyenen, an únes halla.
And running beforehand to a place before them, he climbed into a sycamore tree, to see him, for Jesus was going to pass by that place.	Ar nórala nóvo nómenna epe te, rentes mir vilwarinda alda, cenien se, an Yésus langumne sana nóme.
And when he came thither, Jesus looked up and said: “Zacchaeus, come down quickly , for today it is necessary for me to stay in your house!”	Ar íre túles tar, Yésus yente ama ar quente: “Sakkaio, tula undu lintiénen, an síra mauya nin lemya coalyasse!”
And he came quickly down and received him with joy.	Ar túles lintave undu ar camne se mi alasse.
And when all saw it, they were murmuring, saying: “With a man who is a sinner he went in to eat.”	Ar íre illi cenner sa, anelte nurrula, quétala: “As nér ye ná úcarindo lendes minna matien.”
But Zacchaeus arose and said to the Lord: “Behold, half of my goods I will give to the poor, and if by compulsion I took money from anyone, I will give back four times the sum!”	Mal Saccaio oronte ar quente i Herunna: “Yé, i perta armanyaron antuvan i penyain, ar qui maustanen nampen telpe ho aiquen, nanantuvan lúr canta i nonwe!”
Then Jesus said to him: “Today salvation has come to this house, for also he is a son of Abraham.	Tá Yésus quente senna: “Síra rehtie utúlie coa sinanna, an yando sé ná Avraham yondo.
For the Son of Man came to seek and to save which was lost.”	An i Atanyondo túle cestien ar rehtien ya náne vanwa.”
While they listened to these things he also told them a comparison, since he was near to Jerusalem, and they thought that God's kingdom was going to show itself there and then.	Íre lastanelte sine natinnar yando quentes téna sestie, pan anes hare Yerúsalemenna, ar sannelte i Eruo aranie tanumne insa tasse ar tá.
Therefore he said: “A man, an heir, was going to travel to a remote land to receive a kingdom and thereafter to return.	Etta quentes: “Nér, aryon, lelyumne haira nórenna camien aranie ar epeta nanwenien.
He called ten servants and gave them ten minas and commanded them: 'Trade with them until I shall come.'	Yalles móli quean ar antane tien minar quean ar canne tien: 'Á manca tainen tenna tuluvan.'
But people of his land hated him and sent behind him people that were going to speak for them, to say: 'We do not want this man as king over us.'	Mal nóreryo queni téver se ar mentaner ca se quelli i carpumner tien, quetien: 'Ualme mere nér sina ve aran or me.'
And happened when he returned, after receiving the kingdom, that he commanded that they were to call to him these thralls that he gave the money to, for him to know what they got by trade.	Ar túle íre nanwennes, apa camie i aranie, i cannes i yalumnelte senna móli sine in antanes i telpe, istieryan mana ñentelte mancalénen.
Then the first came and said: “Lord, your mina gained ten minas!”	Tá i minya túle ar quente: “Heru, minalya ñente minar quean!”
Therefore he said to him: “Well done, good slave! Since you have been faithful in the smallest thing, have power over ten cities.”	Etta quentes senna: “Mai carna, mára mól! Pan anaiel voronda mí ampitya nat, sama túre or ostor quean.”
And the second came, saying: “Your mina, lord, made five minas!”	Ar i attea túle, quétala: “Minalya, heru, carne minar lempe!”
He said also to this man: 'Then you rule five cities!'	Quentes yando nér sinanna: 'Tá elye tura ostor lempe!'
But the other came, saying: 'Lord, here is your mina, which I have kept lying in a cloth.	Mal i exe túle, quétala: 'Heru, sisse ea minalya, ya ehépien caitala mi lanne.
For I feared you, since you are a harsh man; you take up what you did not put down and you reap what you did not sow.'	An runcen lyello, pan nalye naraca nér; mapal ama ya ual panyane undu ar cirihtal ya ual rende.'
He said to him: 'Out of your own mouth I am judging you, wicked slave! You knew that I am a harsh man who take up what I did not put down and reap what I did not sow?	Quentes senna: “Et véra antolyallo náman lye, olca mól! Sintel i nanye naraca nér ye mapa ya uan panyane undu ar cirihta ya uan rende?
Then how is that you did not put my money on a table? Then, when I came, I was going to receive it with an added sum.'	Tá manen ná i ual panya telpenya sarnosse? Tá, íre túlen, camumnenyes as napánina nonwe.'
And he said to those that stood by him: 'Take the mina from him and give it to who has the ten minas!'	Ar quentes innar tarner ara se: 'Á mapa i mina sello ar ása anta yen same i minar quean!'
But they said to him: 'Lord, he has ten minas!'	Mal quentelte senna: 'Heru, samis minar quean!'
'I say to you: To everyone that has, more will be given, but to that does not have, also what he has will be taken away.	'Quetin lenna: Ilquenen ye same, amba nauva antaina, mal yen ua same, yando ya samis nauva mapaina oa.
Furthermore, these enemies of mine that did not want me as their king – bring them here and slay them before my eyes!'”	Ente, ñottonyar sine i uar merne ni ve aranelta – áte tala sir ar áte nahta epe hendunyat!'”
Thus, after he said these things, he went in front of them towards Jerusalem.	Sie, apa quentes nati sine, lendes opo te Yerúsalemenna.
And when he came near to Bethphage and Bethany on the mountain called Mount of Olives, he sent froth two of the disciples,	Ar íre túles hare Vet-Fahenna ar Vetanianna i orontesse estaina Oron Milpieron, etementanes atta i hildoron,
saying: “Go into the city before you! When you come thither, you will find a colt bound, that no one has ever sat upon. Loose it and bring it!	quétala: “Mena mir i osto epe let! Íre tuliste tar, hiruvaste pellope nútina, yesse úquen atanion oi ahámie. Áse lehta ar áse tala!
But if anyone says to you: 'What is your reason for loosing it?', you are to say: The Lord has need of it.”	Mal qui aiquen quete lenta: 'Mana castasta lehtien se?', aste quete: I Heru same maure seva.”
And that were sent forth found it just as he said to them .	Ar i nánet etementaine hirnet se aqua ve quentes túna.
But when they loosed the cold, that owned it said to them: “What is your reason for loosing the colt?”	Mal íre lehtanette i pellope, i haryaner se quenter túna: “Mana castasta lehtien i pellope?”
They said: “The Lord has need of it.”	Quentette: “I Heru same maure seva.”
And they led it to Jesus, and they threw their cloaks upon the colt and put Jesus on it.	Ar tulyanettes Yésunna, ar hantette collattar i pellopenna ar panyanet Yésus sesse.
As he moved forward people spread their cloaks on the road.	Mi levierya ompa queni pantaner collaltar i mallesse.
When he came near to the decline down from the Mount of Olives the entire host of the disciples began to have joy and to praise God concerning all the mighty deeds that they saw,	Íre túles hare i pendenna undu Orontello Milpieron i quanda liyúme i hildoron yestaner same alasse ar laita Eru pa ilye i túrie cardar yar cennelte,
saying: “Blessed is who is coming, the King, in the name of the Lord. Peace on earth, and glory in the high places!”	quétala: “Aistana ná ye túla, i Aran, mí Héruo esse. Raine menelde, ar alcar i tarmenissen!”
But some of the Pharisees from the crowd said to him: “Teacher, rebuke your disciples!”	Mal quelli i Farisaron i şangallo quenter senna: “Peantar, á naitya hildolyar!”
But in answer he said: “I tell you: If these people were silent, the stones would cry !”	Mal hanquentasse quentes: “Nyarin lenna: Qui queni sine náner quilde, i sarni yamumner!”
And when he came near and saw the city, his tears flowed for it,	Ar íre túles hare ar cenne i osto, níeryar uller san,
and he said: “Would that you knew in this day that lead to peace! But now they have been hidden from your eyes .	ar quentes: “Nai elye sinte mi aure sina yar tulyar rainenna! Mal sí anaielte nurtaine hendulyalto.
For will come days when your enemies will surround you with a palisade and will press towards you from all directions,	An tuluvar aureli yassen ñottolyar peluvar lye caraxenen ar niruvar lyenna ilye tiellon,
and they will throw you and your children to earth, and they will not allow stone to remain upon a stone in you, since you did not know the time when you were inspected!”	ar hatuvalte lyé ar hínalyar talamenna, ar ualte lavuva ondon lemya ondosse lyesse, pan ualye sinte i lúme yasse anel céşina!”
And coming into the temple he began to throw out who sold ,	Ar túlala mir i corda yestanes et-hate i vancer,
saying to them: “It has been written: 'And my house will be a house of prayer', but you make it a cave of robbers!”	quétala téna: “Anaie técina: 'Ar coanya nauva coa hyamiéva', mal elde carir sa felya piluron!”
And he taught every day in the temple. But the chielf priests and the scribes and the prominent ones of the people sought to destroy him,	Ar peantanes ilya auresse i cordasse. Mal i hére airimor ar i parmagolmor ar i lieo mindar cestaner nancare se,
and yet they did not find what to do , for the entire people stuck to him to listen.	ananta ualte hirne mana carumnelte, an i quanda lie himyane se lastien.
And it happened in one of the days, when he instructed the people in the temple and made the gospel known, that came to him the chief priests and the elders	Ar martane mi er i aurion, íre sé peantane i lien i cordasse ar carne i evandilyon sinwa, i túler senna i hére airimor ar i amyárar
and said to him: “Say us by what authority you are doing these things, and who has given you this authority!”	ar quenter senna: “Queta men mana túrenen cáral nati sine, ar man ánie lyen túre sina!”
In answer he said to them: “I too will ask you about thing, and you answer me:	Hanquentasse quentes téna: “Yando inye maquetuva lenna pa nat, ar alde hanquete ninna:
John's baptism, was it out of heaven or from men?”	Yoháno tumyale, ma anes et menello hya atanillon?”
They spoke among themselves and said: “If we say: Out of heaven, he will say: Then how is that you did not believe in him?	Té caramper mici inte ar quenter: “Qui quetilve: Et menello, quetuvas: Tá manen ná i ualde sáve sesse?
But if we say: From men, the entire people will kill us with stones, for they believe firmly that John was a prophet.”	Mal qui quetilve: Atanillon, i quanda lie vi-nahtuva sarninen, an savilte tancave i Yoháno náne Erutercáno.”
Thus they said that they did not know.	Sie quentelte i ualte sinte.
And Jesus said: “Then I as well will not tell you by what authority I to these things.”	Ar eque Yésus: “Tá yando inya ua quetuva lenna mana túrenen carin nati sine.”
And he began to speak this comparison to the people: “A man planted a garden of vines and allowed some cultivators to use it for money, and he went to another land for a long time.	Ar yestanes quete sestie sina i lienna: “Nér empanne tarwa liantassion ar láver alamolin yuhta sa telpen, ar lendes hyana nórenna anda lúmen.
And when the time came, he sent a slave to the cultivators, for them to give him of the fruit from the garden of vines. But the cultivators, after beating him, sent him away empty.	Ar íre i lúme túle, mentanes mól i alamonnar, antieltan sen i yáveo i tarwallo liantassion. Mal i alamor, apa palpie se, mentaner se oa lusta.
But he sent also another slave. Him as well they sent away, after beating him and humiliating him.	Mal mentanes yando hyana mól. Yando sé mentanelte oa, apa palpie se ar nucumie se.
And yet he again sent a third; him as well they threw outside, after wounding him.	Ananta ata mentanes neldea; yando sé hantelte ettenna, apa harnie se.
Then the lord who had the garden of wines said: 'What am I to do? I will send my beloved son; for him they will have awe.'	Tá quente i heru ye sáme i tarwa lantassion: 'Mana caruvan? Mentuvan melda yondonya; sen samuvalte áya.'
When the cultivators saw him, they spoke among themselves and said: 'That is the heir! Let us kill him, and we will possess his portion!'	Íre i alamor cenner se, carampelte mici inte ar quenter: 'Ta ná i aryon! Alve nahta se, ar elme haryuvar masserya!'
And they threw him out of the garden of vines and killed him. Then what will the lord who has the garden do?	Ar hanteltes et i tarwallo lantassion ar nacanter se. Tá mana caruva i heru ye same i tarwa?
He will come and put an end to those cultivators and will give the garden to others.” When they heard that, they said: “May it not ever happen!”	Tuluvas ar metyuva tane alamor ar antuva i tarwa exelin.” Íre hlasselte ta, quentelte: “Nai uas oi martuva!”
But again he looked at them and said: “Then what does this thing mean that is written: 'The stone which the builders turned away, it has been made head of the corner' – ?	Mal ata yenteset ar quente: “Tá mana tea nat sina ya ná técina: 'I ondo ya i şamnor querner oa, sá anaie carna cas i vinco' – ?
Everyone that falls against that stone will be broken. Anyone upon whom it falls, it will smash him.”	Ilquen ye lanta tana ondonna nauva rácina. Aiquen yenna lantas, ascatuvas se.”
And the scribes and the chief priests sought to put their hands upon him in that hour, but they feared the people. For they understood that he told this comparison about them.	Ar i parmangolmor ar i hére airimor cestaner panya máltat senna yana lúmesse, mal runcelte i liello. An hanyanelte i nyarnes sestie sina pa té.
And after they watched him closely they sent some men that secretly received money to behave as if they were just, to try to catch him in speech, for them to give him over to those who ruled and into the power of the governor.	Ar apa tirneltes harive mentanelte nelli i nuldave camner telpe lengien ve qui anelte faile, nevien mapa se questasse, antieltan se oa in turner ar i mir i nórecáno túre.
And they asked him: “Teacher, we know that you speak and teach as is true, and it is not important to you who a person is, but you teach God's way by the truth.	Ar maquentelte senna: “Peantar, istalme i quetil ar peantal ve nanwa ná, ar ua valda lyen man quén ná, mal peantal Eruo malle i nanwiénen.
May we pay tax to the High King or not?”	Ma lertalve paitya tungwe i Ingaranen hya lá?”
But he perceived their cunning and said to them:	Mal túnes curulta ar quente téna:
“Show me a denarius. Whose picture and writing does it have?” They said: “The High King's.”	“Ánin tana lenár. Mano emma ar tecie samis?” Quentelte: “I ingarano.”
And he saiad to them: “You are to give back, then, the High King's things to the High King, and God's things to God.”	Ar quentes téna; “Alde nananta, tá, i Ingarano nati i Ingaranen, ar Eruo nati Erun.”
And it was not possible for them to seize him in this saying before the people, but they said nothing, in wonder at his answer.	Ar ua ence tien mapa se mi quetie sina epe i lie, mal quentelte munta, elmendasse hanquentaryanen.
But some of the Pharisees, that say that is not resurrection, came and said to him:	Mal quelli i Farisaron, i quetir i ua ea enortale, túler ar maquenter senna:
“Teacher, Moses has written for us: 'If a man's brother dies without child, after he married a woman, it is necessary for his brother to get married to the woman and rise up seed for his brother.'	“Peantar, Móses etécie men: 'Qui nero háno quale ú híno, apa veryanes nís, mauya hánoryan verya i nissenna ar orta erde hánoryan.'
But were seven brothers, and the first got married to a woman, but died without child.	Mal enger hánor otso, ar i minya veryane nissenna, ono qualle ú híno.
Also the second	Yando i attea
and the third got married to her, in the same manner all the seven without a child to follow them, and they died.	ar i neldea veryaner senna, mí imya lé ilye i otso ú híno hilien te, ar quallelte.
In the end also the woman died.	Mí metta yando i nís qualle.
Whose wife will she then be in the resurrection? For she was a wife for all the seven.”	Mano veri tá nauvas i enortalesse? An anes veri ilye i otson.”
Jesus said to them: “The children of this age marry and are given in marriage,	Yésus quente téna: “Randa sino hínar veryar ar nar vertaine,
but that are counted worthy for that age and for the resurrection of the dead do not marry or are given in marriage.	mal i nar nótine valdie enta randan ar i enortalen qualinillon uar verya hya nar vertaine.
Furthermore, they cannot more die, for they are like angels, since they are children of God by being children of the resurrection.	Ente, ualte pole ambe quale, an nalte ve valar, pan nalte Eruo híni návenen i enortaleo híni.
But also Moses showed dead are raised, in the story about the thorn-bush, when he calls the Lord Abraham's God and Isaac's God and Jacob's God.	Mal yando Móses tanne qualini nar ortaine, i nyarnasse i neceltusso, íre estas i Héru Aino Avrahámo ar Aino Ísaco ar Aino Yácovo.
He is not God of dead, but of living ones, for all among them are alive to him.”	Uas qualinion Aino, mal coivearon, an illi mici te nar coivie sen.”
In answer some of the scribes said: “Teacher, you spoke well!”	Hanquentasse quelli i parmangolmoron quenter: “Peantar, carampel mai!”
And they did not more dare to ask him a single question.	An ualte ambe varyane maquete senna erya maquetie.
But he said to them: “How is that they say that the Christ is David's son?	Mal quentes téna: “Manen ná i quetilte i ná i Hristo Laviro yondo?
For David himself says in the book of psalms : The Lord said to my lord: Sit by my right hand,	An Lavir immo quete i parmasse airilírion: I Héru quente herunyanna: Hara ara formanya,
until I shall put your enemies under your feet.	tenna panyuvan ñottolyar nu talulyat.
Thus David calls him lord. Then how is he his son?”	Sie Lavir esta se heru. Tá manen náse yondorya?”
While the entire people listened, he said to his disciples:	Íre i quanda lie lastane, quentes hildoryannar:
“Watch yourselves because of the scribes that wish to walk in robes and live greetings in the market places and the first seats in the synagogues and the prominent places at the suppers,	“Tira inde i parmangolmoin i merir vanta mi larmar ar melir suilier i mancanómessen ar i minya sondar i yomencoassen ar i minde nómi i ahtumattissen,
and that devour the houses of widows and pray long prayes to be seen by others. They will receive a heavier judgement.”	ar i ammatir i coar verulóraiva ar hyamir ande hyamier náven cénine lo exi. Té camuvar ambe lunga namie.”
Now when he looked he saw the rich putting their gifts in the treasuries.	Sí íre yentes cennes i lárear panyea annaltar i harwessen.
Then he saw a poor widowed woman who threw in two small copper pieces,	Tá cennes penya verulóra nís ye minahante pitye urustamitta atta,
and he said: “I tell you truly: This poor widowed woman gave more than them all.	ar eques: “Nyarin len násie: Penya verulóra nís sina antane amba lá te illi.
For all these gave gifts out of their abundance, but this woman gave the entire livelihood that she had.”	An illi sine antaner annar et úveltallo, mal nís sina antane i quanda laulesta ya sámes.”
And when some talked about the temple, that it had lovely stones and was adorned with gifts, he said:	Ar íre quelli caramper pa i corda, i sámes írime ondor ar náne netyaina annalínen, quentes:
“These things that you behold – days will come when stone will not remain upon a stone that will not be thrown down.”	“Nati sine yar yétalde – aureli tuluvar yassen ondo ua lemyuva ondosse ya ua nauva hátina undu.”
And they asked him: “Teacher, what is the time when these things will be, and what the sign that these things will soon happen?”	Ar maquentelte senna: “Peantar, mana i lú yasse nati sine euvar, ar mana i tanwa i nati sine rato martuvar?”
And he said: “Take heed that you will not be caused to stray! For numerous ones will come in my name, saying: I am he!, and: The time is near. Do not go after them!	Ar eques: “Cima i ualde nauva tyárine ranya! An rimbali tuluvar essenyasse, quétala: Inye sé!, ar: I lúme hare ná. Áva lelya ca te!
Furthermore, when you hear about wars and uprisings, do not be terrified! For it is necessary that these things will come first, but the end does not come at the same time.	Ente, íre hlarilde pa ohtali ar amortiéli, áva na ruhtaine! An mauya i nati sine tuluvar minyave, mal i metta ua tule mí imya lúme.”
Then he said to them: “Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom,	Tá quentes téna: “Nóre ortuva nórenna ar aranie aranienna,
and there will be earthquakes, and in place after place pestilences and famines, and will be terrible things seen, and from heaven great signs.	ar euvar cempaliéli, ar mi nóme apa nóme quolúviéli ar saiceléli, ar euvar rúcime natali cénine, ar menello túre tanwali.
But before all these things people will put their hands on you and will persecute you, giving you over to the synagogues and to the prisons, when you are drawn before kings and governors concerning my name.	Mal nó ilye nati sine queni panyuvar máltat lesse ar roituvar le, antala le olla i yomencoain ar i mandoin, íre nalde túcine epe arani ar nórecánor pa essenya.
That will be for you an opportunity for witnessing.	Ta nauva len ecie vettien.
Therefore be firm in your heart that you will not make plans beforehand about how you will speak for yourselves,	Etta na tance endaldasse i ualde caruva panor nóvo pa manen quetuvalde inden,
for I shall give you a mouth and wisdom against which all your enemies will not be able to stand or speak.	an inye antuva len anto ar sailie yanna ilye cotumaldar uar poluva tare hya quete.
Furthermore, you will be given over by parents and by brothers and by your kin and by friends, and they will cill some among you,	Ente, nauvalde antaine olla yando lo nostaru ar lo hánor ar lo nosselda ar lo meldor, ar nahtuvalte quelli mici le,
and you will be hated by all because of my name.	ar nauvalde tévine lo illi essenyanen.
And yet a hair on your head will by no means be destroyed.	Ananta fine careldasse laume nauva nancarna.
By your faithfulness you will save your lives.	Voronweldanen rehtuvalde coivieldar.
Furthermore, when you shall see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, know that her destruction has come near.	Ente, íre cenuvalde Yerúsalem pélina lo hosseli, á ista i nancarierya utúlie hare.
Then it is necessary for that are in Judea to flee to the mountains, and for that are in the midst of the city to leave, and for that are in the regions not to go into it,	Tá mauya in ear Yúreasse uşe i orontinnar, ar mauya in ear i osto endesse auta, ar in ear i ménassen lá lelya mina sa,
for those days are days of vengeance, to make true all things that have been written.	an ente auri nar auri ahtariéva, carien nanwe ilye nati i anaier técine.
Woe to the pregnant women and to those that suckle babies in those days! For shall come a great need on the land and wrath upon this people,	Horro in lapsarwe nissin ar in tyetir vinimor ente auressen! An tuluva túra maure i nóresse ar orme lie sinanna,
and they shall fall by the sword and will be led away into all the nations, and Jerusalem will be trampled under foot by all the nations, until the times of the nations shall be completed.	ar lantuvalte i macilden ar nauvar tulyaine oa mir ilye i nóri, ar Yerúsalem nauva vattaina nu talu lo ilye i nóri, tenna i nórion lúmi nauvar telyaine.
Furthermore, there will be signs in Sun and Moon and stars, and on earth anxiety of nations that do not see escape, by reason of the noise of the sea and its uprising,	Ente, euvar tanwali mi Anar ar Işil ar eleni, ar cemende quárele mici nóri yar uar cene uşwe, castanen ramo i earo ar amortieryo,
when men shall be sick with fear, foreseeing the things coming upon world. For the powers of heaven will be shaken.	íre atani nauvar hlaiwe caurenen, apacénala i nati túlala ambarenna. An menelo túri nauvar páline.
And then they will see the Son of Man come in a cloud with power and great glory.	Ar tá cenuvalte i Atanyondo túla fanyasse arwa túreo ar túra alcaro.
But when these things begin to happen, stand tall and raise your head, for your deliverance is coming near.	Mal íre nati sine yestar marta, tara halle ar á orta carelda, an etelehtielda túla hare.
And he spoke to them a comparison: “Notice the fig-tree and all the other trees:	Ar quentes téna sestie: “Á tunta i relyávalda ar ilye i hyane aldar:
Also when they have twigs, you know to yourselves by examining that now the summer is near.	Yando íre samilte tuimar, istalde inden cendiénen i sí i laire hare ná.
Thus you will also know, when you shall see these things happen, that God's kingdom is near.	Sie yando istuvalde, íre cenuvalde nati sine martea, i Eruo aranie hare ná.
Truly I say to you: This generation will not pass before all things shall happen.	Násie quetin lenna: Nónare sina ua autuva nó ilye nati martuvar.
Heaven and earth shall pass , but my words will not ever pass .	Menel cemenye autuvat, mal ninye quettar uar oi autuva.
But watch yourselves, to stop your heart from being heavy with over-eating and over-drinking and the anxiety of life, and suddenly that day will come upon you	Mal cima inde, pustien endalda návello lunga accamatiénen ar accasuciénen ar quárelénen coireo, ar rincanen enta aure tuluva lenna
like a snare. For it shall come upon all that dwell on the surface of the entire earth.	ve remma. An tuluvas illinnar i marir palúresse i quanda cemeno.
But be awake, always praying that you shall be able to excape all these things that will come, and stand before the Son of Man.”	Mal na coive, illume hyámala i poluvalde uşe ilye nati sine yar tuluvar, ar tare epe i Atanyondo.”
In the days he was in the temple, teaching, but at night he went out and stayed at the mountain called Mount of Olives,	I auressen anes i cordasse, peantala, mal lómisse etelendes ar marne i orontesse estaina Oron Milpieron,
and the entire people came early to him in the temple to hear him.	ar i quanda lie túle arinyave senna i cordasse hlarien se.
Now the festival of Unleavened Breads, which is called Passover, was near.	Sí i aşar Alapulúne Massaron, ya ná estaina Lahtie, náne hare.
And the chief priests and the scribes sought how they could destroy him, since they feared the people.	Ar i hére airimor ar i parmangolmor cestaner manen pollelte nancaritas, pan runcelte i liello.
But Satan went into Judas, the one called Iscariot, who was counted among the twelve,	Mal Sátan lende mir Yúras, i quén estaina Iscariot, ye náne nótina imíca i yunque,
and he went away and spoke with the chief priests and the temple captains about how he was going to give him over to them.	ar lendes oa ar quente as i hére airimor ar i cordahestor pa manen antumneses olla tien.
Then they were happy and said that they were willing to give him money.	Tá anelte valime ar quenter i anelte mérala anta sen telpe.
And he said yes to what they suggested and sought a good moment to give him over when was not a crowd with them.	Ar quentes ná yan intyanelte ar cestane mára lú antien se olla íre ua enge şanga aselte.
Now came the day of unleavened breads, on which it was necessary to kill the lamb of passover,	Sí túle i aure alapulúne massaron, yasse mauyane nahta i eule lahtiéva,
and he sent Peter and John, saying: “Go and prepare for us the passover, for us to eat.”	ar mentanes Péter ar Yoháno, quétala: “Mena ar áven manwa i lahtie, matielvan.”
They said to him: “Where do you wish that we are to make it ready?”	Quentette senna: “Masse meril i caruvammes manwa?”
He said to them : “Behold, when you go into the city, a man who is carrying an earthen vessel will meet you . Follow him into the house into which he shall go.	Quentes túna: “Yé, íre tuliste mir i osto, nér ye cóla cemina vene veluva let. Áse hilya mir i coa mir ya menuvas.
And you are to say to who has the house: “The Teacher says to you: Where is the place where I can eat the passover with my disciples?”	Ar atte quete yenna same i coa: “I Peantar quete lyenna: Masse ea i nóme yassen polin mate i lahtie as hildonyar?”
And that man will show you a big furnished upper room. Prepare there!”	Ar tana nér tanuva lent hoa sorostarwa oromar. Á manwa tasse!”
And they went away and fount the things as he said to them , and they prepared for the passover.	Ar oantette ar hirne i nati ve quentes túna, ar manwanette i lahtien.
And when the time came, Jesus lay at the table, and the apostles with him.	Ar íre i lúme túle, Yésus caine ara i sarno, ar i aposteli óse.
And he said to them: “I have much desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer,	Ar quentes téna: “Ita emérien mate lahtie sina aselde nó perperin,
for I say to you: I will not eat it again before it shall be completed in God's kingdom.”	an quetin lenna: Uan matuva sa ata nó nauvas telyaina Eruo araniesse.”
And receiving a cup he gave thanks and said: “Take this and send it from person to person among you.	Ar cámala yulma antanes hantale ar quente: “Á mapa si ar ása menta quenello quenenna mici le.
For I say to you: From now I shall not drink from the fruit of the vine before God's kingdom shall come.”	An quetin lenna: Ho sí uan sucuva ata i yávello i liantasseo nó Eruo aranie tuluva.”
Furthermore, he took a bread, gave thanks, broke it and said: “This is my body, that will be given on your behalf. Do this to recall me.”	Ente, nampes massa, antane hantale, rance sa ar quente: “Si ná hroanya, ya nauva antaina rá len. Cara si enyalien ni.”
And the cup in the same manner after they ate the evening meal, he saying: “This cup is the new covenant by means of my body, which will be poured out on your behalf.	Ar i yulma mí imya lé apa mantelte i ahtumat, sé quétala: “Yulma sina ná i vinya vére hroanyanen, ya nauva etulyaina rá len.
But behold, my betrayer's hand is with me on the table.	Mal yé, vartonyo má ná asinye i sarnosse!
For the Son of Man is going away, as he is destined; and yet woe for the person through whom he is given over!”	An i Atanyondo autea, ve náse martyaina; ananta horro i quenen ter ye náse antaina olla!”
Therefore they began to talk among themselves about who among them was that was going to do this thing.	Etta yestanelte carpa mici inte pa man mici te náne ye carumne nat sina.
But was also a quarrel between them about who among them seemed to be the greatest.	Mal enge yando costie imbi te pa man mici te şéne náve i antúra.
But he said to them: “The kings of the nations are their lords, and that have power over them are called benefactors.	Ono quentes téna: “I nórion arani nar herultar, ar i samir túre or te nar estaine maicarindor.
But you do not be so. It is necessary for who is the greatest among you to be like the youngest, and for who rules, to be like a servant.	Mal elde áva na sie. Mauya yen ná i antúra mici le náve ve i amnessa, ar yen cane, náve ve núro.
For who is the greatest, who lies at the table or the servant? Is it not who lies at the table? But among you I am like the servant.	An man i ambe túra ná, ye caita ara i sarno hya i núro? Ma uas ye caita ara i sarno? Ono mici le nanye ve i núro.
But you are that have remained with me in my trials,	Mal elde nar i elémier asinye tyastienyassen,
and I make a covenant with you, like my Father has made with me a covenant, about a kingdom,	ar carin vére aselde, ve Atarinya acárie asinye vére, pa aranie,
for you to eat and for you to drink at my table in my kingdom, and for you to sit on thones to judge the twelve tribes of Israel.	matieldan ar sucieldan ara sarnonya aranienyasse, ar harieldan mahalmassen namien i nossi yunque Israélo.”
Simon, Simon, behold! Satan has demanded to sift you like grain!	Símon, Símon, yé! Sátan acánie silta le ve ore!
But I have prayed concerning you, that your faith will not be insufficient, and when at time you have returned, bring strength to your brothers.”	Mal inye ahyámie pa elye, i savielya ua nauva loica, ar íre mi lú enutúliel, á tala antoryame hánolyain.”
Then he said to him: “Lord, I am ready to go with you into prison and death alike!”	Tá quentes senna: “Heru, nanye manwa menien aselye mir mando ar qualme véla!”
But he said: “I say to you, Peter: A cock will not sound today before you have said thrice that you do not know me.”	Mal eques: “Quetin lyenna, Péter: Tocot ua lamyuva síra nó equétiel nel i ual ista ni.”
And he said to them: “When I sent you without purse and food-box and shoes, surely you did not lack a single thing?” They said: “We did not.”	Ar quentes téna: “Íre le-mentanen ú pocolleo ar matsocolco ar hyapato, lau pennelte erya nat?” Quentelte: “Lánelme.”
Then he said to them: “But now it is necessary for who has a purse to bring it, in the same manner a food-box, and it is necesssary for how lacks a sword to sell his cloak and get a sword for the money.	Tá quentes téna: “Mal sí mauya yen same pocolle tala sa, mi imya lé yando matsocolca, ar mauya yen pene macil vace collarya ar ñete macil i telpen.
For I say to you that it is necessary that this thing written about me will be made true: 'And he was counted among lawless ones.' For which concerns me will be completed.”	An quetin len i mauya i nat sina técina pa ni nauva carna nanwa: 'Ar anes nótina mici şanyelórali.' An ya ape ni nauva telyaina.”
Then they said: “Lord, see, here are two swords.” He said to them: “They are enough.”	Tá quentelte: “Heru, ela, sisse eat macil atta.” Quentes téna: “Tú faryat.”
After he went out he went, as his habit was, to the Mountain of Olives, and his disciples followed him.	Apa etelendes mennes, ve haimerya né, i Orontenna Milpieron, ar hildoryar se-hilyaner.
Having come to the place he said to them: “Pray, to stop yourselves from coming into temptation!”	Túlienwa i nómenna quentes téna: “Hyama, pustien inde tuliello úşahtienna!”
And he went away from them, about a stone's throw, and he fell to his knees and prayed,	Ar sé lende oa telo, os hatie sarneva, ar lantanes occaryanta ar hyamne,
saying: “Father, if you wish, take this cup from me! And yet, may your will happen, not mine.”	quétala: “Atar, qui meril, á mapa yulma sina nillo! Ananta, nai indómelya martuva, lá ninya.”
Then an angel from heaven showed himself to him and brought him strength.	Tá vala menello tannexe sen ar talle sen antoryame.
But coming into an agony he prayed still more arduously, and his face was wet with what was like drops of blood, falling to the ground.	Mal túlala mir anquale hyamnes en ambe urdave, ar cendeleya náne linque yanen náne ve limbar serceva, lantala i talamenna.
And he arose from prayer, went to the discuples and found them asleep with grief,	Ar orontes hyamiello, lende i hildonnar ar hirne te lorne nyérenen,
and he said to them: “What is your reason for being asleep? Rise and pray, to stop yourselves from coming into temptation!”	ar quentes téna: “Mana castalda náven lorne? Á orta ar hyama, pustien inde tuliello úşahtienna!”
While still he spoke, behold! a crowd, and the man called Judas, one of the twelve, went in front of them. He came to Jesus to kiss him.	Íre ena carampes, yé! şanga, ar i nér estaina Yúras, quén i yunqueo, lende opo te. Túles Yésunna miquien se.
But Jesus said to him: “Judas, do you betray the Son of Man with a kiss?”	Mal Yésus quente senna: “Yúras, ma vartal i Atanyondo miquenen?”
When the people with him saw what was going to happen, they said: “Lord, are we to strike with the sword?” 	Íre i queni óse cenner ya martumne, quentelte: “Heru, ma petuvalme i macilden?”
And one among them struck the chief priest's slave and cut off his right ear.	Ar quén mici te pente i héra airimo mól ar aucirne forya hlarya.
But in answer Jesus said: “Let this as well happen.” And he touched the ear and healed him.	Mal hanquentasse Yésus quente: “Lava yando si marta!” Ar appanes i hlas ar nestane se.
Jesus then said to the chief priests and to the temple captains and to the elders that were come there to seize him: “Have you come having swords and clubs, as upon a robber?	Yésus tá quente i hére airimonnar ar i cordahestannar ar amyárannar i náner túlienwe tar mapien se: “Ma etutúlielde arwa macillion ar rundalion, ve arponna?
Day after day I was with you in the temple, and you did not put your hands on me. But this is your hour, and darkness rules.”	Aure apa aure engen aselde i cordasse, ar ualde panyane máldat nisse. Mal si ná lenya lúme, ar mornie ture.”
Then they seized him andd led him away and brought him into the chief priests's house, but Peter followed nearby.	Tá nampeltes ar tulyane se oa ar talle se mir i héra airimo coa, mal Péter hilyane haiya.
When they lit a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat among them.	Íre nartanelte náre endesse i paco ar hamner undu uo, Péter hamne mici te.
But was a maidservant who saw him by the fire, and after watching Peter she said: “Also this man was with them.”	Mal enge núre ye cenne se ara i ruine, ar apa tirie Péter quentes: “Yando nér sina náne aselte.”
But he denied it, saying: “I do not know him, woman!”	Mal laquentes sa, quétala: “Uan ista se, nís!”
After a short time another person, seeing him, said: “You as well one among them!” But Peter said: “Man, I am not!”	Apa şinta lúme hyana quén, cénala se, quente: “Yando elye er mici té!” Mal Péter quente: “Nér, uan!”
And after about an hour was past, another man said firmly: “Indeed this man was with him! He is also from Galilee!”	Ar apa os lúme náne vanwa, hyana nér quente tancave: “É yando nér sina náne óse! Náse yando Alileallo!”
But Peter said: “Man, I do not know what you are saying!” And in that moment, while he was still speaking, a cock sounded.	Mal Péter quente: “Nér, uan ista ya quétal!” Ar mi yana lú, íre en quequentes, tocot lamyane.
And the Lord turned and looked at Peter, and Peter recalled the saying of the Kord when he said to him: “Before a cock sounds today, you will deny me thrice.”	Ar i Heru querne inse ar yente Péterenna, ar Péter enyalle i Heruo quetie íre quentes senna: “Nó tocot lamya síra, ni-laquetuval nel.”
And he went outside and broke down in tears.	Ar lendes ettenna ar talante níressen.
Now the men that had him in custody behaved towards with with scorn, striking him.	Sí i neri i sámer se mandosse lenganer senna yaiwenen, pétala se.
And after they covered him they asked: “Speak like a prophet! Who was that struck you?”	Ar apa tompeltes maquentelte: “Queta ve Erutercáno! Man náne ye pente lye?”
And numerous other blasphemies they spoke to him.	Ar rimbe hyane naiquetiéli quentelte senna.
When the day came, the council of elders of the people, the chief priests and the scribes alike, assembled. And they drew him before their council, saying:	Íre i aure túle, i ocombe amyáraron i lieo, i hére airimor ar i parmangolmor véla, ocomner. Ar tunceltes epe ocombelta, quétala:
“If you are the Christ, tell us!” But he said to them: “Also if I told you, you were by no means going to believe it.	“Qui elye ná i Hristo, ámen nyare!” Mal quentes téna: “Yando qui nyarnen len, laume savumneldes.
Furthermore, if I told you, you were by no means going to give me an answer.	Ente, qui maquenten lenna, laume antumnelde nin hanquenta.
But from now the Son of Man shall sit beside God's right hand of power.”	Mal ho sí i Atanyondo haruva ara Eruo forma túreva.”
Then all among them said: “Are you, then, God's son?”	Tá illi mici te quenter: “Ma elye, tá, ná Eruo yondo?”
He said to them: “You say that I am.”	Quentes téna: “Elde quetir i nanye.”
They said: “What more need do we have of witnesses? For we ourselves have heard it from his own mouth!”	Quentelte: “Mana amba maure samilve astaroiva? An elve inwe ahlárier sa véra antoryallo!”
And after their entire multitude arose, they led him to Pilate.	Ar apa quanda rimbelta oronte, tulyaneltes Pilátonna.
They began to speak about his supposed crimes, saying: “This man we have found subverting our nation and forbidding that anyone pay taxes to the High King, and he says about himself that he is Christ, a king.”	Yestanelte quete pa intyaine ongweryar, quétala: “Nér sina ihírielme nuquéra nórelma ar váquéta i aiquen paitya tungwi i Ingaranen, ar quetis pa inse i náse Hristo, aran.”
But Pilate asked him: “Are you king of Jews?” In answer he said: “You say it.”	Mal Piláto maquente senna: “Ma elye aran Yúraron ná?” Hanquentasse eques: “Elye quete sa.”
But Pilate said to the chief priests and to the crowds: “I do not find crime on this man.”	Mal Piláto quente i hére airimonnar ar i şangannar: “Uan hire ongwe atan sinasse.”
But they pressed him, saying: “He stirs up the people, teaching through the entire Judea, and after beginning in Galilee he has come also here!” 	Mal té ninder se, quétala: “Valtas i lie, peantala ter i quanda Yúrea, ar apa yestie Aileasse utúlies yando sir!”
But Pilate, when he heard that, asked if the man was from Galilee.	Ono Piláto, íre hlasses ta, maquente qui i atan náne Alileallo.
And after he knew that he was indeed from Herod's kingdom, he sent him to Herod, since also he was in Jerusalem in those days.	Ar apa sintes i é anes Herolo araniello, se-mentanes Herolenna, pan yando sé náne Yerúsalemesse yane auressen.
But Herod, when he saw Jesus, had great joy, for beforehand he long wished to meet him, after hearing about him, and he had the hope that he was going to see a sign happen by him.	Mal Herol, íre cennes Yésus, sáme túra alasse, an nóvo andave mernes velitas, apa hlarie pa se, ar sámes i estel i cenumnes tanwa martea sénen.
He asked him many questions, but he answered him nothing.	Maquentes senna rimbe maquetier, ono sé hanquente sen munta.
But the chief priests and the scribes arose and talked about crimes that they said he did.	Mal i hére airimor ar i parmangolmor oronter ar caramper pa ongweli yar quentelte carnes.
Then Herod and his guards thought that he was nothing, and in mockery they covered him with a bright garment and sent him back to Pilate.	Tá Herol as cundoryar sanner i anes munta, ar yaiwesse tompeltes calima larmanen ar nanwentaner se Pilátonna.
On that day Herod and Pilate started a friendship, one with the other, for before this they were enemies.	Yana auresse Herol ar Piláto yestaner nilme, quén as i exe, an nó si anette cottoli.
Pilate then assembled the chief priests and the people	Piláto tá comyane i hére airimor ar i lie
and said to them: “You brought this man to me as one who stirs up the people, and behold! I examined him before you, but I did not find in him guilt concerning the things that you say he has done.	ar quente téna: “Tallelde nér sina ninna ve quén ye valta i lie, ar yé! cendanenyes epe le, mal uan hirne sesse cáma pa i ongwi yar quételde acáries.
Indeed also Herod did not , for he sent him back to us, and behold! nothing worthy of death has been done by him.	É yando Herol láne, an se-nanwentanes venna, ar yé! munta valda qualmeo anaie carna lo se.
Therefore I will chastise him; then I will release him. 	Etta paimestuvanyes; tá lehtuvanyes.” 
But their entire host cried: “Take away this man, but release to us Barabbas!”	Mal quanda liyúmelta yáme: “Á mapa oa nér sina, mal ámen lehta Varavas!”
He was a man thrown into prison by reason of an uprising that had happened in the city, and of murder.	Sé náne nér hátina mir mando castanen amortiéno ya náne martienwa i ostosse, ar nahtiéno.
Again Pilate called them, since he wanted to release Jesus.	Ata Piláto yalle te, pan mernes lehta Yésus.
Then they cried, saying: “Crucify him, crucify him!”	Tá yámelte, quétala: “Áse tarwesta, áse tarwesta!”
For the third time he said to them: “Than what evil has this man done? Nothing worthy of death I found in him. After giving him chastisement I will therefore release him.”	Mí neldea lú quentes téna: “Tá mana ulco nér sina acárie? Munta valda qualmen hirnen sesse. Apa antie sen paimesta etta lehtuvanyes.”
But they pressed him with loud shouts, demanding his crucifixion, and their shouts prevailed.	Mal nindeltes hoe rambelínen, cánala tarwestierya, ar rambeltar orturner.
And Pilate judged that they were going to get what they wanted.	Ar Piláto namne i ñetumnelte ya mernelte.
He released to them the man thrown into prison because of an uprising and because of murder, whom they asked for, but Jesus he gave over to their will.	Lehtanes tien i nér hátina mir mando amortiénen ar nahtiénen, ye arcanelte, mal Yésus antanes olla nirmeltan.
And when they led him away, they seized a person called Simon from Cyrene who came from the fields, and they compelled him to carry his cross.	Ar íre mentaneltes oa, nampelte quén estaina Símon Cirénello ye túle i restallon, ar mauyanelte sen cole tarwerya.
But followed him a great multitude from the people, and some women that struck themselves with grief and were wailing for him.	Mal hilyane se hoa liyúme i liello, ar nisseli i pentexer nyérenen ar náner yaimie sen.
Jesus turned towards them and said: “Daughters of Jerusalem, do not be wailing for me! Be wailing for yourselves and for your children, for behold! days are coming in which people will say: 'Happy are the women without fruit, and the wombs that did not conceive and he nipples that did not suckle!'	Yésus querne inse téna ar quente: “Yerúsalémo yeldi, áva na yaimie nin! Na yaimie elden ar hínaldain, an yé! auri túlar yassen queni quetuvar: 'Valime nar i nissi ú yáveo, ar i súmar yar uar nostane ar i tyetsi yar uar tyente!'
Then they will begin to say to the mountains: 'Fall upon us!', and to the hills: 'Cover us!'	Tá yestuvalte quete i orontinnar: 'Á lanta menna!', ar i ambonnar: 'Áme tope!'
For if they do thest things when the tree is moist, what will happen when it has withered?”	An qui carilte nati sine íre i alda ná níte, mana martuva íre ehesties?”
But two other men, evildoers, were also led thither to be slain with him.	Mal hyana nér atta, ulcarindor, nánet yando tulyaine tar náven nance óse.
And when they came to the place called Skull, they crucified him and the evildoers, one on his right and one on his left,	Ar íre túlelte i nómenna estaina Caraxo, tarwestanelte sé ar i ulcarindor, er foryaryasse ar er hyaryaryasse.
But Jesus said: “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.” Furthermore, to distribute his garments they threw lots.	Mal Yésus quente: “Atar, áten apsene, an ualte ista mana cáralte.” Ente, satien larmaryar hantelte şanwali.
And the people watched. But the rulers talked with mockery, saying: “Others he has saved; let him save himself, if this man is God's Christ, the chosen one.”	Ar i queni tirner. Mal i turi caramper yaiwenen, quétala: “Hyanali erehties; lava sen rehta inse, qui nér sina ná Eruo Hristo, i cílina.”
Also the soldiers behaved towards him with scorn. They came near and presented him with sour wine	Yando i ohtari lenganer senna yaiwenen. Túlelte hare ar antaner se sára limpenen
and said: “If you are king of Jews, save yourself!”	ar quenter: “Qui nalye Yúraron aran, á rehta imle!”
Also was a writing above him: “This is the king of Jews.”	Yando enge tecie or se: “Si ná aran Yúraron.”
But one of the hanging evildoers blasphemed him: ”Are you not the Christ? Save yourself and us!”	Mal er i lingala úcarindoron naiquente senna: “Ma elye ua i Hristo? Á rehta imle ar met!”
In answer the other rebuked him and said: ”Do you not fear God, now that you are under the same judgement?	Hanquentasse i exe naityane se ar quente: “Ma ual ruce Erullo, sí íre nalye i imya námiesse?
And we justly so, for we are receiving that to which we are worthy by the things that we have done, but this man has done nothing evil.”	Ar engwe failave sie, an cámangwe yan nangwe valde i natinen yar carnengwe, mal nér sina acárie munta ulca.”
And he said to him: “Jesus, recall me when you come in your kingdom!”	Ar quentes senna: “Yésus, áni enyale íre tulil aranielyasse!”
And he said to him: “Truly I say to you: Today you will be with be in Paradise.”	Ar quentes senna: “Násie quetin lyenna: Síra euval asinye mi Paralis.”
Now the hour was around the eighth, and darkness fell upon the entire earth until the ninth hour,	Sí i lúme náne os i enquea, ar mornie lantane i quanda cemenna tenna i nertea lúme,
since the sunlight failed. Then the curtain in the temple was torn down the middle.	pan i áre loitane; tá i fanwa i cordasse náne narcaina undu i ende.
And crying with a mighty voice, Jesus said: “Father, into your hands I give over my spirit!” After saying that he expired.	Ar yámala taura ómanen, Yésus quente: “Atar, mir mátyat antan olla fairenya!” Apa quetie ta effirnes.
When the centurion saw what happened, he gave glory to God and said: “Truly this man was just!”	Íre i tuxantur cenne ya martane, antanes alcar Erun ar quente: “Nanwave nér sina náne faila!”
And all the crowds that were gathered for this sight, when they saw that happened, went away beating their chest.	Ar ilye i şangar yar náner ocómienye cenie sinan, íre cennelte yar martaner, lender oa pétala ambostelta,
But that knew Jesus stood far away, also the women that came with him from Galilee, watching these things.	Mal i sinter Yésus tarner haiya, yando i nissi i túler óse Alileallo, íre cennelte nati sine.
And came a man whose name was Joseph, a person of the Council, a good and just man.	Ar túle nér yeo esse náne Yósef, quén i Combeo, mane ar faila nér.
He did not say yes to their plan or their deed. He came from Arimathea, a city of the Jews, and looked forward to God's kingdom.	Sé ua quente ná panoltanna hya cardaltanna. Túles Arimaşeallo, osto i Yúraron, ye yente ompa Eruo aranienna.
After going inside to Pilate he asked for Jesus' body.	Apa menie minna Pilátonna arcanes Yésuo hroa.
And he took it down and wrapped it with linen, and he put him in a carved-out tomb in the rock, in which no one had lain before.	Ar nampeses undu ar vaitane sa páşenen, ar se-panyanes hrótanoirisse i ondosse, yasse úquen náne caitienwa nóvo.
This was the day of Preparation, and the beginning of the sabbath was near.	Si náne i aure Manwiéva, ar i sendareo yesta náne hare.
But the women that came with him from Galilee followed and saw the tomb and the place where his body was placed.	Mal i nissi i túler óse et Alileallo hilyaner ar cenner i noire ar i nóme yasse hroarya náne panyaina.
Then they went back to prepare spices and fragrant oils. But they rested on the sabbath, according to the commandment.	Tá nanwennelte manwien tyávelasseli ar níşime milloli. Mal sendelte i sendaresse, i axannen.
On the first day of the week they went very early to the tomb, bearing the spices prepared by them.	I minya auresse i otsolasse lendelte ita arinyave i noirinna, cólala i tyávelassi manwaine lo te.
But they found the stone rolled away from the grave, and when they went inside, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus Christ.	Mal hirnelte i ondo peltaina oa i noirillo, ar íre lendelte minna, ualte hire i Heru Yésus Hristo hroa.
While they were in wonder about this, behold! two men with radiant garments stood beside them.	Íre anelte elmendasse pa si, yé! nér atta arwe alcarinque larmar tarnet ara te.
When the women were terrified and turned their face towards the ground, the men said to them: “How is that you are seeking the Living One among dead?	Íre i nissi náner ruhtaine ar querner cendelelta i talamenna, i neri quenter téna: “Manen ná i cestealde i Coirea mici qualini?
He is not here, but he has been raised! Recall how he spoke to you when he was still in Galilee,	Uas sisse, mal anaies ortaina! Enyala manen carampes lenna íre en anes Alileasse,
saying that it is necessary for the Son of Man to be given over into the hands of men of sin and to be cruficied and to rise on the third day.”	quétala i mauya i Atanyondon náve antaina olla mannar atanion úcareva ar náve tarwestaina ar orta i neldea auresse.”
And they recalled his sayings,	Ar enyallelte quetieryar,
and they returned from the tomb and told all these things to the eleven and to all the others.	ar nanwennelte i noirillo ar nyarner ilye nati sine i minquen ar ilye i exin.
They were Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary mother of Jacob. Also the other women with them told the apostles these things.	Anelte María Mahtaléne, ar Yoanna, ar María amil Yácovo. Yando i hyane nissi aselte nyarner i apostelin nati sine.
But these sayings seemed to them like folly, and they did not believe what the women said.	Mal quetier sine şéner tien ve aucie, ar ualte sáve ya i nissi quenter.
But Peter arose and went to the tomb, and bending forward he saw the wrappings alone. Then he went away, in wonder about what had happened.	Mal Péter oronte ar norne i noirinna, ar cúnala ompa cennes i vaimar erinque. Tá lendes oa, elmendasse pa mana náne martienwa.
But behold! on the same day two among them were on their way to a city called Emmaus, two and a quarter leagues from Jerusalem,	Mal yé! i imya auresse atta mici te nánet tiettasse mastonna estaina Emmaus, lár atta ar canasta Yerúsalemello,
and they were talking one with the other about all these things that had happened.	ar quequentette quén as i exe pa ilye nati sine yar náner martienwe.
Now when they were talking and exchanged words, also Jesus himself came near and walked with them,	Sí íre quequentette ar quaptanette quettali, yando Yésus immo túle hare ar vantane asette,
but their eyes were kept from knowing him.	mal henduttat nánet hépine istiello se.
He said to them: ”What are these words that you are exchanging while you are walking?” And they stood , with grief in their face.	Quentes túna: “Mana quettar sine yar quapteaste íre vanteaste?” Ar tarnette arwe nyére mi cendeletta.
In answer the man called Cleophas said to him: “Are you the only person dwelling in Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened in it in these days?”	Hanquentasse i quén estaina Cleopas quente senna: “Ma nalye i erya quén márala Yerúsalemesse ye ua ista i nati yar amartier sasse mi auri sine?”
And he said: “What?” They said to him: “The things that concern Jesus from Nazareth, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and the entire people	Ar quentes túna: “Mana?” Quentette senna: “I nattor yar ape Yésus Násaretello, ye náne Erutercáno taura mi carda ar quetta epe Eru ar i quanda lie
– and how our chief priests gave him over to a judgement of death and crucified him.	– ar manen hére airimonyar antaner se olla námien qualmeva ar tarwestaner se.
But we had the hope that this man was that was going to deliver Israel. But besides all these things, now is the third day after this happened.”	Mal sámelme i estel i nér sina náne ye etelehtumne Israel. Ono ara ilye nati sine, síra ná i neldea aure apa si martane.
Furthermore, some women among us have startled us, for after going early to the tomb	Ente, nisseli mici me acaptier me, an apa menie arinyave i noirinna
without finding his body they came saying that they saw a vision of some angels, that said that he is alive.	ú hiriéno hroarya túlelte quétala i cennelte maur valalíva, i quenter i náse coirea.
Also, some among us went away to the tomb, and they found that was so, just as the women said, but they did not see him.”	Yando, quelli mici me lender oa i noirinna, ar hirnelte i enge sie, aqua ve i nissi quenter, mal ualte cene sé.”
Then he said to them: “O senseless ones, slow of heart to believe all the things that the Prophets said!	Tá quentes túna: “A úhandar, lence endeo savien ilye i nati yar i Erutercánor quenter!
Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and go into his glory?”	Ma ua mauyane i Hriston perpere nati sine ar mene mir alcarerya?”
And beginning from Moses, and all the Prophets, he caused them to understand the things that concern himself in the Scriptures.	Ar yestala ho Móses, ar ilye i Erutercánor, tyarnes tu hanya i nati yar apir inse ilye i Tehtelessen.
And they came to the city that was the goal of their journey, and he did as if he was going to go forward from there.	Ar túlette i mastonna ya náne lendatto met, ar sé carne ve qui lelyumnes ompa talo.
But they compelled him, saying: “Remain with us , for the evening is near, and the day will soon be gone.”	Mal mauyanette sen, quétala: “Á lemya asemme, an i şinye hare ná, ar i aure rato nauva vanwa.”
And when he lay with them at the table he took the bread, blessed it, broke it and gave it to them.	Ar íre caines asette ara i sarno nampes i massa, aistane sa, rance sa ar antane sa tun.
And in that moment their eyes were fully opened, and they knew him, but he disappeared from them.	Ar mi yana lú henduttat nánet aqua pantaine, ar sintettes, mal vánes tullo.
And they said, one to the other: “Did our heart not burn when he was speaking with us on the road, when he opened the Scriptures to us?“	Ar quentette, quén i exenna: ”Ma endangwa ua uryane íre quequentes asengwe i mallesse, íre pantanes i Tehteler vent?”
And in that same hour they arose and returned to Jerusalem, and they found the eleven and that were gathered with them,	Ar mi yana imya lúme orontette ar nanwennette Yerúsalemenna, ar hirnette i yunque ar i náner ocómienwe aselte,
who said: “The Lord has indeed been raised and has shown himself to Simon!”	i quenter: “I Heru é anaie ortaina ar atánie inse Símonden!”
And they told about that had happened on the road and how he was made known to them by breaking the bread.	Ar tú nyarnet pa yar náner martienwe i mallesse ar manen anes carna sinwa tun raciénen i massa.
When they still spoke about these things, Jesus himself stood in their midst and said to them: “May you have peace!”	Íre en quentelte pa nati sine, Yésus immo tarne endeltasse ar quente téna: “Nai samuvalde raine!”
But since they were terrified and had fear, they thought that they saw a spirit.	Mal pan anelte ruhtaine ar sámer caure, sannelte i cennelte faire.
Therefore he said to them: “What is your reason for your fear, and how is that thoughts of unbelief are arising in your heart?	Etta quentes téna: “Mana castalda rucieldan, ar manen ná i ortear sanweli úsaviéva endaldasse?
See my hands and my feet, that it is I; touch me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you are seeing that I have.”	Cena mányat ar talunyat, i inye ná; áni appa ar cena, an faire ua same hráve yo axor ve cénalde i inye same.”
And saying this he showed them his hands and his feet.	Ar quétala si tannes tien máryat ar talyat.
But when they still did not believe, for the joy and for the wonder, he said to them: “Are you having here thing to eat?”	Mal íre en ualte sáve, i alassenen ar i elmendanen, quentes téna: “Ma sámalde sisse nat matien?”
And they gave him a piece of broiled fish,	Ar antanelte sen ranta aptaina lingwiva,
and he took it and ate it before their eyes.	ar nampeses ar mante sa epe hendultat.
Then he opened their mind, allowing them to understand the scriptures,	Tá pantanes sámalta, lávala tien hanya i Tehteler,
and he said to them: “So is written, that the Christ was going to suffer, and that he was going to rise on the third day,	ar quentes téna: “Sie ná técina, i perperumne i Hristo, ar i ortumnes i neldea auresse,
and that by his name one was going to preach repentance of sins in all the nations. Beginning from Jerusalem	ar i esseryanen mo nyardumne inwis úcariva ilye i nóressen. Yestala Yerúsalemello
you will be witnesses of these things.	elde nauvar vettoli pa nati sine.
And behold! I send you that of which my father gave promise. But you stay in the city until you shall be covered with power from on high.”	Ar yé! inye menta lenna ta pa ya Atarinya antane vanda. Mal elde hara i ostosse tenna nauvalde tópine túrenen et tarmenello.”
Thereafter he led them as far as Bethany, and he raised his hands and blessed them.	Epeta tulyanes te tenna Vetánia, ar ortanes máryat ar aistane te.
And while he blessed them, he was taken away from them and carried up into heaven.	Ar íre aistanes te, anes mapaina oa tello ar cólina ama mir menel.
And they fell down to him and returned to Jerusalem having great joy.	Ar lantanelte undu sen ar nanwenner Yérusalemenna arwe túra alasseo.
And they were always in the temple, blessing God.	Ar anelte illume i cordasse, aistala Eru.
Beginning of the gospel about Jesus Christ.	Yesta i evandilyono pa Yésus Hristo.
Isaiah the Prophet has written:Behold! I send my herald before your face,to prepare your way!	Yesaia i Erutercáno etécie:Yé! Mentan tercánonya epe cendelelya,manwien mallelya!
Voice of one who is calling in the wilderness:You prepare the Lord's way!Make his paths straight!	Óma queno ye yáma i ravandasse: Alde manwa i Héruo malle! Cara tieryar tére!
So John the Baptizer was in the wilderness, preaching baptism of repentance , for forgiveness of sins.	Sie Yoháno i Tumyando enge i ravandasse, nyardala tumyale inwisto, apsenien úcariva.
And the entire region of Judea and all who dwelt in Jerusalem went out to him, and they were baptised by him in the Jordan river, confessing their sins.	Ar i quanda Yúrea-ména ar illi i marner Yerúsalemesse etelender senna, ar anelte tumyaine lo sé Yordan-síresse, etequétala úcareltar.
And John was clad in raiments of hair of camels and had a belt around his hips, and he ate grasshoppers and wild honey.	Ar Yoháno náne vaina mi larmali findeva ulumpion ar sáme quilta os oşwerya, ar mantes salquecápor ar verca lís.
And he preached, saying: “After me comes who is stronger than I – I am not worthy of bending down and of untying his shoelaces .	Ar nyardanes, quétala: “Apa ni túla ye ná tulca lá inye – inye ua valda luhtiéno undu ar avanutiéno hyapalattaryat.
I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with Holy Spirit.	Inye tumya le nennen, mal sé le-tumyuva Aire Feanen.”
In those days Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptised in Jordan by John.	Yane auressen Yésus túle Nasaretello Alileasse ar náne tumyaina Yordande lo Yoháno.
And in the same moment, coming up from the water, he saw the heavens split and the Spirit as dove come down upon him.	Ar mí imya lú, túlala amba et i nenello, cennes menel şanca ar i Faire ve cucua túla undu senna.
And a voice was heard out of heaven: “You my Son, the beloved; of you I have thought well.”	Ar óma náne hlárina et menello: “Tyé Yondonya, i melda; pa tyé asánien mai.”
And in the same moment the Spirit led him into the wilderness.	Ar mí imya lú i Faire se-tulyane mir i ravanda.
And he was in the wilderness for forty days, being tempted by Satan, and he was with the wild beasts, and the angels served him.	Ar anes i ravandasse auressen canquean, nála şahtaina lo Sátan, ar anes as i hravani, ar i vali veuyaner se.
And after John was thrown into gaol Jesus went into Galilee, making known God's gospel	Ar apa Yoháno náne hátina mandonna Yésus lende mir Alilea, cárala sinwa Eruo evandilyon
and saying: “The time is full, and God's kingdom has come near! Find repentance and believe in the gospel!”	ar quétala: “I lúme quanta ná, ar Eruo aranie utúlie hare! Hira inwis ar sava mí evandilyon!”
While he walked beside the Sea of Galilee he saw Simon and Andrew , Simon's brother, throwing their into the sea, for they were fishermen.	Lan vantanes ara Ear Alileo cennes Símon ar Andreas, Símondo háno, hátala rembettar mir i ear, an anette raitandoli.
Then Jesus said to them: “Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men!”	Tá Yésus quente túna: “Tula apa ní, ar caruvanyet raitandoli atanion!”
And in the same moment they left their nets and followed him.	Ar mí imya lú hehtanette rembettar ar hilyanet sé.
He went a short walk further and saw James son of Zebedee and John his brother, while they were in a boat mending their nets,	Lendes an şinta vanta ar cenne Yácov Severaion ar Yoháno hánorya, lan anette i luntesse envinyatála rembettar,
and in that moment he called them. And they left their father in the boat with the paid men and went away after him.	ar mí yana lú tu-yaldes. Ar hehtanette ataretta i luntesse as i paityaine neri ar oantet apa se.
And they went into Capernaum. And as soon as the day of rest came, he went into the synagogue and taught.	Ar lendelte mir Capernaum.Ar ve rongo ve i sendare túle, lendes mir i yomencoa ar peantane.
And his teaching filled them with wonder, since he taught as a person having authority, and not as the scribes.	Ar peantierya te-quante elmendanen, pan peantanes ve quén arwa héreo, ar lá ve i parmangolmor.
In that moment there was in their synagogue a man controlled by an unclean spirit, and he cried:	Mí yana lú enge yomencoaltasse nér túrina lo úpoica faire, ar yámes:
“What is to us and to you, Jesus from Nazareth? Have you come to undo us? I know who you are – God's Holy One!”	“Mana men ar lyen, Yésus Nasaretello? Ma utúliel nancarien me? Istan man nalye – Eruo Aire!”
But Jesus spoke firmly to it, saying: “Be silent, and come out of him!”	Mal Yésus carampe tulcave senna, quétala: “Na quilda, ar ettula sello!”
And the unclean spirit, after it caused him to twitch and cry with a great voice, came out of him.	Ar i úpoica faire, apa se-tyarnes rihta ar yame túra ómanen, ettúle sello.
And all among them marveled, and everyone asked the others: “What is this? A new teaching! With authority he commands also the unclean spirits, and they do as he says.”	Ar illi mici te tatallaner, ar ilquen maquente i exi: “Mana si? Vinya peantie! Hérenen canis yando i úpoice fairi, ar carilte ve quetis.”
And the news about him were spread in the entire region of Galilee.	Ar i sinyar pa sé náner palyaine i quanda Alilea-ménasse.
And as soon as they left the synagogue, they went into the house of Simon and Andreas , with Jacob and John.	Ar ve rongo ve hehtanelte i yomencoa, lendelte mir coa Símon ar Andreaswa, as Yácov ar Yoháno.
Simon's wife's mother was bed-ridden with a fever , and they told him about her quickly.	Símondo verio amil náne caimassea úrenen, ar nyarnelte sen pa sé lintiénen.
And going to her he raised her up, and the fever went away from her, and she served them.	Ar lelyala senna ortanes se, mápala márya, ar i úre váne sello, ar veuyanes tien.
And after evening came, when the Sun had set , the people brought to Jesus all that were ill and that were possessed by demons,	Ar apa şinye túle, íre Anar náne nútiéla, i queni taller Yésunna illi i náner hlaiwe ar i náner haryaine lo raucor,
and the entire city was assembled before the door.	ar i quanda osto náne ocómiéla epe i fenna.
And he healed numerous ones that were ill with various sicknesses, and he expelled many demons, but he did not allow the demons to speak, since they knew who he was.	Ar nestanes rimbali i náner hlaiwe alavéle hlívelínen, ar et-hantes rimbe raucoli, mal uas láve i raucoin quete, pan sintelte man anes.
And early, while was still dark, he arose and went outside and went away to a lonely place, and there he prayed.	Ar arinyave, lan en morna né, orontes ar lende ettenna ar oante erinqua nómenna, ar tasse hyamnes.
But Simon and who were with him sought him	Mal Símon ar i náner óse cestaner se
and found him, and they said to him: “All are searching you!”	ar se-hirner, ar quentelte senna: “Illi lye-cestear!”
But he said to them: “Let us go to another place, to the nearby villages, for me to preach also there, for that is the reason why I went forth.”	Ono quentes téna: “Alve lelya hyana nómenna, i hari mastonnar, nyardienyan yando tasse, an ta ná i casta yanen etelenden.”
And he went, preaching in their synagogues throughout entire Galilee, and expelling the demons.	Ar lendes, nyardala yomencoaltassen ter quanda Alilea, ar et-hátala i raucor.
And came to him a leprous person, who petitioned him and fell upon his knees, saying to him: “If you want to, you can make me clean.”	Ar túle senna helmahlaiwa quén, ye arcane sello ar lantane occaryanta, quétala senna: “Qui meril, polilye care ni poica.”
And full of pity Jesus reached out with his hand and touched him, and he said to him: “I want to! Become clean!”	Ar quanta ofelmeo Yésus rahtane máryanen ar appane se, ar eques senna: “Merin! Ola poica!”
And in the same moment the skin-disease disappeared from him, and he was clean.	Ar mí imya lú i helmahlíve váne sello, ar anes poica.
But Jesus gave him firm orders, and quickly he sent him away,	Mal Yésus antane sen tulce canwali, ar lintiénen se-mentanes oa,
and he said to him: “See that you tell nothing to anybody, but go and you show yourself to the priest, and for your cleansing sacrifice what Moses commanded, as a witness to them.”	ar eques senna: “Cena i nyaril munta aiquenen, mal mena ar alye tanaxe i airimon, ar poitielyan yaca ya Móses canne, ve vettie tien.”
But after going away the man started to tell it far and wide, spreading the story widely. Therefore it was no longer possible for Jesus to go openly into a city, but he was outside, in lonely places. And yet people came to him from all directions.	Mal apa menie oa i nér yestane nyare sa palan, palyala i nyarna pallave. Etta ua ence Yésun ambe lelya pantave mir osto, mal anes ettesse, eressie nómelissen. Ananta queni túler senna ilye tiellon.
After some days he again came to Capernaum, and was told that he was at home.	Apa aureli ata túles Capernaumenna, ar náne nyárina i anes maresse.
And numerous ones assembled, until there was no more space, not even before the door, and he spoke the word to them.	Ar rimbali ocomner, tenna lá enge amba nóme, yando lá epe i fenna, ar quentes téna i quetta.
And some came, bringing to him a paralyzed man carried by four.	Ar queneli túler, tálala senna úlévima nér cólina lo canta.
But because of the crowd they could not carry him to Jesus. Therefore they took away the roof over the place where he was, and after digging a hole they sent down the stretcher on which the lame was lying.	Mal i şanganen ualte polde colitas Yésunna. Etta nampelte oa i tópa or i nóme yasse anes, ar apa sapie assa mentanelte undu i colma yasse caine i úlévima.
When Jesus saw their faith he said to the lame one: “Child, your sins are forgiven.”	Íre Yésus cenne savielta quentes i úlévimanna: “Hína, úcarelyar nar apsénine.”
But there were there some scribes, sitting and thinking in their heart: “How can this man speak thus? He is blaspheming! Who may forgive sins except one, God?”	Mal enger tasse parmangolmoli, hámala ar sánala endaltasse: “Manen nér sina lerta carpa sie? Naiquétas! Man lerta apsene úcari hequa er, Eru?”
But Jesus, who in the same moment perceived by his spirit that they had such thoughts, said to them: “What is your reason for thinking these things in your heart?	Ono Yésus, ye mí imya lú túne faireryanen i sámelte taite sanwi, quente téna: “Mana castalda sanien nati sine endaldasse?
What is the more easy to say, to say to the lame: Your sins are forgiven, or to say: Rise, take your stretcher and walk!	Mana i ambe aşquétima, quete i úlévimanna: Úcareldar nar apsénine, hya quete: Á orta, mapa colmalya ar vanta!
But so that you can know that the Son of Man has authority to forgive sins on earth,” – he said to the lame:	Mal istieldan i same i Atanyondo hére apsenien úcari cemende, ” – quentes i úlévimanna:
“I say to you: Rise, take your stretcher, and go to your house!”	“Quetin lyenna: Á orta, mapa colmalya, ar mena coalyanna!”
Then he arose, and in the same moment he took his stretcher and went out before them all, and they were all beside themselves with wonder, and they gave glory to God, saying: “Such a thing we haven't ever seen!”	Tá orontes, ar mí imya lú nampes colmarya ar menne ettenna epe te illi, ar anelte illi ara inte elmendanen, ar antanelte alcar Erun, quétala: “Taite nat ualve oi ecénie!”
Again he went forth to beside the sea, and the entire crowd came to him, and he taught them.	Ata etelendes ara i earenna, ar i quanda şanga túle senna, ar peantanes tien.
And traveling he saw Levi the son of Alphaios sitting at the tax office, and he said to him: “Follow me!” And he arose and followed him.	Ar lelyala cennes Lévi yondorya Alfaio hárala i tungwemende, ar quentes senna: “Áni hilya!” Ar orontes ar hilyane se.
And it happened that he lay at the table in his house, and numerous tax collectors and sinners lay there with Jesus and his disciples, for they were numerous people following him.	Ar martane i caines ara i sarno coaryasse, ar rimbe tungwemóli ar úcarindoli cainer tasse as Yésus ar hildoryar, an anelte rimbe queni se-hilyala.
But the scribes among the Pharisees, seeing that he ate with the sinners and the tax collectors, said to his disciples: “Does he eat with the tax collectors and sinners?”	Mal i parmangolmor imíca i Farisar, cénala i mantes as i úcarindor ar i tungwemor, quenter hildoryannar: “Ma matis as i tungwemor ar úcarindor?”
Hearing this, Jesus said to them: “The firm do not have need of a healer, but the sick ones. I have come to call, not just ones, but sinners.”	Hlárala si, Yésus quente téna: “I tulcar uar same maure nestandova, mal i hlaiwar. Utúlien yalien, lá failar, mal úcarindor.”
The disciples of John and the Pharisees had a fast. And they came and said to Jesus: “How is that the disciples of John and the Pharisees' disciples have fasts, but your disciples do not have fasts?”	Hildoryar Yoháno ar i Farisar sámer lamate. Ar túlelte ar quenter Yésunna: “Manen ná i hildoryar Yoháno ar i Farisaron hildor samir lamati, mal hildolyar uar same lamati?”
And Jesus said to them: “Surely the friends of the bridegroom cannot have a fast while the bridegroom is with them? In the whole time when they have the bridegroom in their midst they cannot have a fast.	Ar Yésus quente téna: “Lau i endero meldor polir same lamate lan i ender ea aselte? Mí quanda lúme yasse samilte i ender endaltasse ualte pole same lamate.
But days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will have a fast, in that day.	Mal aureli tuluvar íre i ender nauva mapaina oa tello, ar tá samuvalte lamate, enta auresse.
No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old cloak, but if he does do so, its full strength pulls from it, the new from the old, and there will be a worse rent.	Úquen neme lilma alapihta lanneo yára collasse, mal qui é caris sie, quanta túrerya tuce sallo, i vinya i yárallo, ar euva ambe faica narcie.
Furthermore, no one pours new wine in old skin bottles; if he does, the wine bursts the skin bottles, and the wine is lost and the skin bottles are destroyed. But people put new wine in new skin bottles!”	Ente, úquen ulya vinya limpe yáre helmolpessen; qui caris, i limpe ruve i helmolpi, ar i limpe ná vanwa ar i helmolpi nar nancarne. Mal queni panyar vinya limpe vinye helmolpessen!”
And happened, as he passed the grain fields on the day of rest, that his diciples started to pick the heads of grain.	Ar martane, íre lahtanes i orirestar i sendaresse, i hildoryar yestaner lepta i cari oriva.
And the Pharisees said to him: “Look! How is that your disciples ar doing what is not allowed on the day of rest?”	Ar i Farisar quenter senna: “Ela! Manen ná i hildolyar cárar ya ua lávina i sendaresse?”
But he said to them: “Have you not ever read what David did when he suffered need and was hungry, he and the men that were with him?	Mal sé quente téna: “Ma ualde oi ehentie ya Lavir carne íre sámes maure ar náne maita, sé ar i neri i náner óse?
He went into God's house, at the time of Abiathar the High Priest, and ate the breads of showing, which are not permitted food for anyone except for the priests, and he gave also to the men that were with him.”	Lendes mir coarya Eru, Avyaşar i Héra Airimo lúmesse, ar manter i mastar taniéva, yar uar lávina matta aiquenen hequa i airimoin, ar antanes yando i nerin i náner óse.”
And he said to them: “The day of rest was created for the good of Man, and not Man for the good of the day of rest.	Ar quentes téna: “I sendare náne ontaina Atano márien, ar lá Atan márien i sendareo.
Thus the Son of Man is Lord also of the day of rest.”	Sie i Atanyondo ná Heru yando i sendareo.”
Again he went into a synagogue, and was there a man having a withered hand,	Ata lendes mir yomencoa, ar enge tasse nér arwa hessa máo,
and they watched him to see if he was going to heal the man on the day of rest, so they could accuse tim.	ar tirneltes cenien qui nestumnes i nér i sendaresse, ecien ten ulquete se.
And he said to the man having the withered hand: “Arise and stand in the middle!”	Ar quentes i nerenna arwa i hessa máo: “Á orta ar tara i endesse!”
Then he said to them: “May one on the day of rest do good or do evil, save a person or kill a person?” But they were silent.	Tá quentes téna: “Ma mo lerta i sendaresse care márie hya care ulco, rehta quén hya nahta quén?” Mal anelte quilde.
And after looking from person to person among them with anger, in grief since their heart was so hard, he said to the man: “Reach out with your hand!” And he reached out with it, and his hand was restored .	Ar apa yétie quenello quenenna mici te arwa rúşeo, nyéresse pan endalta náne ta hranga, quentes i nerenna: “Á rahta mályanen!” Ar rahtanes sanen, ar márya náne envinyanta.
Then the Pharisees went out, and they were quick to make plans against him with the Herodians, to undo him.	Tá i Farisar lender ettenna, ar anelte linte carien panoli senna as i Heroldili, nancarien se.
But Jesus and his disciples returned to the sea, and a great host from Galillee and Judea followed him.	Mal Yésus as hildoryar nanwenner i earenna; ar hoa liyúme Alileallo ar Yúreallo se-hilyane.
Also from Jerusalem and Idumea and from beyond Jordan and from the region around Tyre and Sidon a great host came to him, since they heard about all the things that he did.	Yando ho Yerúsalem ar Irúmea ar han Yordanello ar i ménallo os Tír ar Síron hoa liyúme túle senna, pan hlasselte pa ilye i nati yar carnes.
And he said to his disciples that they were to have a boat ready for him, to stop the crowd from pressing in on him.	Ar quentes hildoryannar i samumnelte lunte manwa sen, pustien i şanga niriello senna.
For he healed numerous ones, and so all that had painful illnesses fell upon him in order to touch him.	An rimbali nestanes, ar sie illi i sámer naicelie hlíveli lantaner senna appien se.
And the unclean spirits, whenever they saw him, threw themselves down before him and cried , saying: “You are the Son of God!”	Ar i úpoice fairi, quiquie cenneltes, hantexer undu epe se ar yámer, quétala: “Elye ná i Eruion!”
But with many words he spoke firmly to them, to stop them from making him known.	Mal rimbe quettalínen carampes tulcave téna, pustien te cariello se sinwa.
And he went up into a mountain and called to himself the people he wanted, and they went to him.	Ar lendes ama mir oron ar yalde insenna i queni i sé merne, ar lendelte senna.
And he chose twelve, whom he also called apostles, for them to be with him and for him to sent them out to preach	Ar cilles yunque, i yando estanes aposteli, náveltan óse ar etementieryan te nyardien
and for them to have the power of throwing out demons.	ar samieltan i túre et-hatiéva raucor.
And the twelve that he chose were Simon, to whom he gave the after-name Peter,	Ar i yunque i cilles náner Símon, yen antanes i epesse Péter,
and John the son of Zebedee and John Jacob's brother – to whom he gave the after-name Boanerges, which means Sons of Thunder –	ar Yoháno Severaion ar Yoháno Yácovo háno – yent antanes i epesse Voaneryes, ya tea Yondor Hundiéva –
and Andrew and Philip and Bartholomew and Mathhew and Jacob the son of Alpheus, and Thaddeus, and Simon the Cananite,	ar Andréas ar Filip ar Vartoloméo ar Matteo ar Tomas ar Yácov yondorya Alfeo, ar Tardeo, ar Símon i Cananya,
and Judas Iscariot, who after betrayed him.	ar Yúras Iscariot, ye apa vartane se.
And he went into a house.	Ar lendes mir coa.
Again the crowd gathered, and so it was not even possible for them to eat their food.	Ata i şanga ocomne, ar sie yando ua ence ten mate mattalta.
But when his family heard it, they went to seize him, for they said: “He had gone out of his mind!”	Mal íre nosserya hlasse sa, lendelte mapien se, an quentelte: “Avánies et sámaryallo!”
Furthermore, the scribes that came down from Jerusalem said: “He is possessed by Beelsebub, and he throws the demons out by the power of the lord of the demons!”	Ente, i parmangolmor i túler undu Yerúsalemello quenter: “Náse haryaina lo Vélsevuv, ar et-hatis i raucor túrenen i heruo raucoron!”
And after calling them to himself, he said to them by means of comparisons: “How can Satan throw Satan out?	Ar apa yalie te insenna, quentes ten sestielínen: “Manen Sátan pole et-hate Sátan?
For if a kingdom is split against itself, that kingdom cannot stand;	An qui aranie ná şanca insanna, sana aranie ua pole tare;
and if a house is split against itself, that house will not be able to stand.	ar qui coa ná şanca insanna, sana coa ua poluva tare.
Furthermore, if Satan has arisen against himself and is split, he cannot stand, but is coming to his end.	Ente, qui Sátan ortanie insenna ar şanca ná, uas pole tare, mal túla mettaryanna.
Indeed no one who has come into a strong man's house can steal his goods if he does not first bind the strong man, and then he will steal the things in his house.	É úquen ye utúlie mir coa polda nerwa pole pile armaryar qui uas minyave nute i polda nér, ar tá piluvas i nati coaryasse.
Truly I say to you that all things will be forgiven to men, all the sins and blasphemies with which they blaspheme.	Násie quetin lenna i ilye nati nauvar apsénine atanin, ilye i úcari ar naiquetier yainen naiquetilte.
But anyone who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not ever receive forgiveness, but carries the guilt of eternal sin.”	Mal aiquen ye naiquete i Aire Feanna ua oi camuva apsenie, mal cole i cáma oira úcareo.”
That he said because they said: “He has an unclean spirit.”	Ta quentes pan quentelte: “Samis úpoica faire.”
Now his mother and his brothers came, and standing on the outside they sent inside to him, to call him .	Sí amillerya ar hánoryar túler, ar tárala i ettesse mentanelte minna senna, yalien se.
A crowd sat around him, and they said to him: “Behold! Your mother and your brothers on the outside are seeking you.”	Şanga hamne os se, ar quentelte senna: “Yé! Amillelya ar hánolyar i ettesse lye-cestear.”
But he answered them: “Who are my mother and my brothers?”	Mal hanquentes ten: “Man nar amillinya ar hánonyar?”
And after looking from person to person among who sat around him in a circle, he said: “Behold my mother and my brothers!	Ar apa yétie quenello quenenna imíca i hamner os se rindesse, quentes: “Ela amillinya ar hánonyar!
Anyone who does God's will, (s)he is my brother and my sister and my mother.”	Aiquen ye care Eruo indóme, sé hánonya ar néşanya ar amillinya ná.”
And again he began to teach by the sea. A great host gathered near to him, and therefore he went into a boat and sat in the sea, but the whole crowd by the sea was on the shore.	Ar ata yestanes peanta ara i ear. Hoa şanga ocomne hare senna, ar etta lendes mir lunte ar hamne i earesse, mal i quanda şanga ara i ear náne i hrestasse.
And he taught them numerous things by comparisons and said to them in his teaching:	Ar peantanes tien rimbe natali sestielínen ar quente téna peantieryasse:
“Listen! Behold, the sower went out to sow.	“Á lasta! Yé, i rerindo lende ettenna rerien.
And in his sowing some seeds fell by the road, and the birds came and ate them.	Ar rerieryasse erdeli lantaner ara i malle, ar i aiwi túler ar manter te.
Other seeds fell upon the rock, where they did not have deep soil, and they rose up quickly , for lacking deep soil.	Hyane erdeli lantaner i ondonna, yasse ualte sáme núra cemen, ar orontelte lintiénen, peniénen núra cemen.
But when the Sun arose, they were burnt , and for lacking root they withered.	Mal íre Anar oronte, anelte urtaine, ar peniénen şundo hestanelte.
Other seeds fell among the thorns, and the thorns came up and strangled them, and they did not give fruit.	Hyane erdeli lantaner imíca i neceli, ar i neceli túler ama ar quorner te, ar ualte antane yáve.
But others fell upon the good earth, and they arose and grew and made fruit, and they bore added measures, thirty and sixty and a hundred.”	Mal exeli lantaner i mára cemenna, ar orontelte ar aller ar carner yáve, ar collelte napánine lestali, nelquean ar enenquean ar tuxa.”
And he said: “Who has ears for hearing, let him hear!”	Ar eques: “Ye same hlaru hlarien, lava sen hlare!”
And when he was alone, the people around him with the twelve asked him about the comparisons.	Ar íre anes erinqua, i queni os se as i yunque maquenter senna pa i sestier.
And he said to them: “To you the secret of the kingdom of heaven is given, but to those who are on the outside everything happens in comparison,	Ar quentes téna: “Elden menelo araniéno fóle ná antaina, mal in nar i ettesse ilqua marta sestiessen,
so that they can look and look, but not see, and so that they can hear and hear, but not understand – not ever turning themselves around, and so receiving forgiveness.	ecien ten yéta ar yéta, mal lá cene, ar ecien ten hlare ar hlare, mal lá hanya – lá oi nanquérala inte, ar sie cámala apsenie.”
Furthermore, he said to them: “You do not know this comparison; then how will you understand all the other comparisons?	Ente, quentes téna: “Ualde ista sestie sina; tá manen hanyuvalde ilye i hyane sestier?
The sower sows the word.	I rerindo rere i quetta.
 who are by the road are the people in whom the word is sown, but when they hear it, Satan comes in the same moment and takes away the word that was sown in them.	I nar ara i malle nar i queni issen i quetta ná rérina, mal íre ahlárieltes, Sátan tule mí imya lú ar mapa oa i quetta ya náne rérina tesse.
And in the same manner, these people are the ones sown on the rock: In the moment that they hear the word, they receive it with joy.	Ar mí imya lé, queni sine nar i rérinar i ondosse: Mí lú ya ahlárielte i quetta, camiltes arwe alasseo.
But they do not have root in themselves, but remain for a time; then, as soon as tribulation or persecution happens by the word, they fall away.	Ananta ualte same şundo intesse, mal lemyar ter lúme; tá, ve rongo ve şangie hya roitie marta i quettanen, lantalte oa.
Others are the ones sown among the thorns; these are who have heard the word,	Exeli nar i rérinar imíca i neceli; sine nar i ahlárier i quetta,
but the concerns of this world and the temptation of riches and the desires for the other things come in and choke the world, and it does not give fruit.	mal mar sino cimier ar laro úsahtie ar i íri i hyane nativa tulir minna ar quorir i quetta, ar uas cole yáve.
But the ones sown on good soil are who listen to the word and receive it and bear fruit – one, thirty added measures, and another, sixty, and another, a hundred.	Ono i rérinar i mára cemende nar i lastar i quettanna ar camir sa ar colir yáve – er, napánine lestar nelequean, ar exe, enequean, ar exe, tuxa.
And he said to them: “Surely a lamp is not brought to be put under a box or under a bed? Is it not brought to be put on the lampstand?	Ar quentes téna: “Lau calma ná talaina náven panyaina nu colca hya nu caima? Ma uas talaina náven panyaina i calmatarmasse?
For there is nothing that is hidden except in order to be revealed; nothing has been concealed except for it to come into the open.	An ea munta ya ná nurtaina hequa náven apantaina; munta anaie halyaina hequa tulieryan mir i pantie.
If anyone has ears to hear , let him hear.”	Qui aiquen same hlaru hlarien, lava sen hlare.”
And he said to them: “Heed what you are hearing: By the measure with which you measure will be measured to you; indeed more will be added to you.	Ar quentes téna: “Cima ya hláralde: I lestanen yanen lestalde nauva lestaina len; é amba nauva napánina len.
For who has, to him will be given; and who does not have, also what he has will be taken from him.”	An ye same, sen nauva antaina, ar ye ua same, yando ya samis nauva mapaina sello.”
And he said: “Thus God's kingdom is like when a man throws seed upon the earth,	Ar eques: “Sie Eruo aranie ná ve íre nér hate erde i cemenna,
and he is asleep at night and rises at day, and the seed sprouts and grows tall – the man does not know how.	ar náse lorna lómisse ar orya auresse, ar i erde tuia ar ale halla – i nér ua ista manen.
By itself the earth bears fruit: first leaves, then it makes head of the straw, finally full grain in head of the straw.	Insanen i cemen cole yáve: minyave lasseli, tá caris cas i sirpeo, teldave quanta ore caresse i sirpeo.
As soon as the fruit is ripe, the man sends the sickle, since the harvest has come.	Ve rongo ve i yáve ná manwa, i nér menta i circa, pan i yávie utúlie.”
And he said: “With what shall we compare God's kingdom, and what is the comparison that we shall make concerning it?	Ar eques: “As mana sestuvalve Eruo aranie, ar mana i sestie ya caruvalve pa sa?
It is like a seed of mustard, which at the time that it is sown in the earth is the smallest of all seeds which are on earth –	Nás ve erde sinápio, ya i lúmesse ya nás rérina i cemende ná i ampitya ilye erdion yar ear cemende –
but when it is sown, it comes up to be larger than all other vegetables and makes huge branches, until heaven's birds can dwell in its shadow.”	mal íre nas rérina, tulis ama náven hoa lá ilye hyane quear ar care hoe olvali, tenna menelo aiwi polir mare laimeryasse.”
Thus with many such comparisons he spoke to them the word, everything that they could listen to.	Sie rimbe taiti sestielínen quentes ten i quetta, ilqua ya ence ten lasta.
Except by a comparison he did not speak to them, but when he was alone with his disciples, he gave them insight concerning all things.	Hequa sestiénen uas carampe téna, mal íre anes erinqua as hildoryar, antanes tien tercen pa ilye nati.
And on that day, when evening had come, he said to his disciples: “Let us cross to the other shore.”	Ar mi yana ré, íre şinye náne túlienwa, quentes hildoryannar: “Alve lahta i hyana hrestanna.”
And after sending away the crowd he their brought him with them using the boat in which he sat, and were other boats with him.	Ar apa mentie oa i şanga talleltes aselte i luntenen yasse hamnes, ar enger hyane lunteli óse.
Then a mighty storm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, until the boat was near to being filled.	Tá túrea raumo oronte, ar i falmar penter mir i lunte, tenna i lunte náne hare návenna quátina.
But he was in the back of the boat, asleep on a pillow, and they woke him up and said to him: “Lord, is it not important to you that we are dying?”	Mal sé náne pontisse i lunteo, lorna nirwasse, ar eccoitaneltes ar quenter senna: “Heru, ma ua valda lyen i quélalme?”
Then he roused himself and spoke firmly to the wind and said to the sea: “Be silent, be at rest!” And the wind ceased, and was a great silence.	Tá ortanes inse ar carampe tulcave i súrinna ar quente i earenna: “Na quilda, na senda!” Ar i súre pustane, ar enge hoa quilde.
And he said to them: “How is it you are fearful? Do you still not have faith?”	Ar quentes téna: “Manen ná i nalde caurie? Ma en ualde same savie?”
But great fear seized them, and they said one to the other: “Who indeed is he, since also wind and sea do as he says?”	Mal hoa caure te-nampe, ar quentelte quén i exenna: “É man náse, pan yando súre yo ear carit ve quetis?”
And they came to the other shore of the sea, into region of the Gerasenes.	Ar túlelte i hyana hrestanna i earo, mir ména Erasenyaiva.
In the same moment that they left the boat, a man having an unclean spirit met them, coming from the tombs.	Mí imya lú ya hehtanes i lunte, nér arwa úpoica faireo velle se, túlala i noirillon.
He had his haunt among the graves, and until that time no one yet could bind him, also not with fetters.	Sámes vehterya imíca i sapsar, ar tenna lúme yana úquen ena polde nutitas, yando lá naxainen.
Numerous times he was bound with bonds on his feet and with chains, but he tore the fetters and broke the bonds, and no one had the strenght to control him.	Rímbe lúr anes nútina nútelínen talyatse ar naxalínen, mal narcanes i naxar ar ascante i núti, ar úquen sáme i poldore turien se.
Always, at night and at day, he was among the graves and in the mountains, crying and beating himself with stones.	Illume, lómisse yo auresse, anes imíca i sapsar ar i orontissen, yámala ar palpala inse sarnínen.
When he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and fell down before him.	Íre cennes Yésus hairallo, nornes ar lantane undu epe se.
Crying with a great voice he said: “What is to me and to you, Jesus, son of God Highest? I put you under oath by God, do not torment me!”	Yámala túra ómanen eques: “Mana nin ar lyen, Yésus, Eru Antaro yondo? Lye-panyan nu vanda Erunen, ávani ñwalya!”
For Jesus said to him: “Unclean spirit, come out of the man!”	An Yésus quente senna: “Úpoica faire, tula et i nerello!”
And he asked him: “What is your name?” And he answered: “My name is Legion, for we are numerous.”	Ar maquentes senna: “Mana esselya?” Ar hanquentes: “Essenya Lehion, an nalme rimbe.”
Then he urgently prayed that Jesus would not send them out of the region.	Tá hormenen arcanes i ua Yésus te-mentumne et i ménallo.
But there was there by the mountain a huge pig-herd eating .	Mal enge tasse ara i oron hoa polcalámáre mátala.
And they petitioned him, saying: “Send us into the pigs, so we can come into them!”	Ar arcanelte sello, quétala: “Áme menta mir i polcar, tulielman mir té.”
And he allowed them. Then the unclean spirits came out and went into the pigs, and the herd went rushing over the edge into the sea, a number around two thousand, and they drowned in the sea.	Ar láves tien. Tá i úpoice fairi ettúler ar lender mir i polcar, ar i lámáre lende rimpa olla i lanca mir i ear, nóte os húme atta, ar quornelte i earesse.
But their herders looking after them fled and told it in the city and in the fields, and people came to see what had happened.	Mal i mavari ortírala te úşer ar nyarner sa i ostosse ar i restassen, ar queni túler cenien mana náne martiéla.
Thus they came to Jesus, and they saw the man who previously was demon-possessed sitting in health of mind, he who formerly was possessed by the legion, and they were terrified.	Sie túlelte Yésunna, ar cennelte i nér ye nóvo náne raucoharyaina hámala málesse sámo, sé ye yá náne haryaina lo i lehion; ar anelte ruhtaine.
 who saw it told them about which had happened to the demon-possessed and to the pigs.	I cenner sa nyarner tien pa ya náne martiéla i raucoharyainan ar i polcain.
And they started to petition him, for him to leave their regions .	Ar yestanelte arca se, autieryan ménaltallon.
When he went into the boat, the man who formerly was demon-possessed asked to be with Jesus.	Íre lendes mir i lunte, i nér ye yá náne raucoharyaina arcane náve as Yésus.
But he did not allow him, but said to him: “Go to your house and to your kin, and tell them about everything that the Lord has done to you and the mercy that he had on you.”	Ono uas láve sen, mal quente senna: “Mena coalyanna ar nosselyanna, ar nyara tien pa ilqua ya i Heru acárie lyen ar i órávie ya sámes lyesse.”
And he went away and started to make known througout the Ten Cities everything that Jesus did for him, and all were filled with wonder.	Ar lendes oa ar yestane care sinwa ter i Ostor Quean ilqua ya Yésus carne sen, ar illi náner quátine elmendanen.
After Jesus again crossed to the other side with the boat, a large host gathered to him, and he was beside the sea.	Apa Yésus ata lahtane i hyana hrestanna i luntenen, hoa liyúme ocomne senna, ar anes ara i ear.
Now came one of the synagogue chiefs, whose name was Jairus. Seeing Jesus he fell down before his feet	Sí túle quén i yomencoanturion, yeo esse náne Yairo. Cénala Yésus lantanes undu epe talyat
and petitioned him with urgency, saying: “My little daughter is at life's brink ! Come and put your hands on her, for her to be saved and keep her life!”	ar arcane se hormenen, quétala: “Cinta selyenya ná coivie-lancasse! Tula ar á panya mályat sesse, náveryan rehtaina ar hepe coivierya!”
Then he went off with him. And a large crowd followed him, pressing towards him.	Tá oantes óse. Ar hoa şanga hilyane se, nírala senna.
And were there a woman tormented by a stream of blood for twelve years.	Ar enge tasse nís ñwalyaina lo celume serceva ter loar yunque.
She was put to many pains by many healers, and after using everything that she had she received nothing helpful; on the contrary, she was now more ill.	Anes panyaina rimbe naicennar lo rimbe nestandoli, ar apa yuhtie ilqua ya sámes camnes munta aşea; úsie, anes sí ambe hlaiwa.
When she heard about Jesus, she came behind him in the crowd and touched his robe,	Íre hlasses pa Yésus, túles ca se i şangasse ar appane vaimarya,
for she said to herself: “If I just touch his robe, I shall be healed!”	pan quentes insenna: “Qui eryave appan vaimarya, nauvan nestaina!”
And in the same moment the stream of blood ceased, and she perceived in her body that she was healed from her painful illness.	Ar mí imya lú i celume serceva pustane, ar túnes hroaryasse i anes nestaina naicelea hlíveryallo.
In the same moment Jesus perceived in himself how power went out from him, and he turned and said: “Who touched my robe?”	Mí imya lú Yésus túne insesse manen túre lende et sello, ar quernes immo ar quente: “Man appane vaimanya?”
But his disciples sait to him: “You are seeing the crowd press against you, and then you say: Who touched me?”	Mal hildoryar quenter senna: “Cénal i şanga níra lyenna, ar tá quétal: Man ni-appane?”
But he looked around himself to see the person who did this.	Ono yentes os se cenien i quén ye carne si.
But the woman, terrified and trembling, knowing which had happened to her, came and fell down before him and told him the whole truth.	Mal i nís, ruhtaina ar pálala, istala ya náne martiéla sen, túle ar lantane undu epe se ar nyarne sen i quanda nanwie.
Jesus said to her: “Daughter, your faith has saved you. Go in peace, and be in health from your painful illness.”	Yésus quente senna: “Selye, savielya erehtie lye. Mena rainesse, ar na málesse naicelea hlívelyallo.”
Before he finished speaking, some came from the house of the synagogue ruler and said: “Your daugher is dead. Why are you still troubling the teacher?”	Nó telyanes quete, quelli túler i coallo i yomencoanturwa ar quenter: “Selyelya ná qualin. Manen ná i en tarasteal i peantar?”
But Jesus, hearing which was said, said to the synagoge ruler: “Do not fear, only believe!”	Mal Yésus, hlárala ya náne quétina, eque i yomencoanturenna: “Áva ruce, eryave sava!”
Now he did not allow anyone to come with him except Peter and Jacob and John, Jacob's brother.	Sí uas láve aiquenen tule óse hequa Péter ar Yácov ar Yoháno, Yácovo háno.
And they came to the house of the synagogue ruler, and he noticed the clamour and the wailing people and those who shouted with many wailings,	Ar túlelte coanna i yomencoanturwa, ar túnes i yalme ar i yaimie queni ar i yámer rimbe yaimelínen,
and going in he said to them: “What is your reason for making clamour and wailing? The child has not died, but she is asleep.”	ar lelyala minna quentes téna: “Mana castalda carien yalme ar yaime? I hína ua aquálie, mal náse lorna.”
Then they laughed at him with scorn. But he, after sending them all outside, brought the child's father and mother and who were with him, and he went to the room where the child was.	Tá landelte senna yaiwenen. Mal sé, apa mentie te illi ettenna, talle i híno atar ar amil ar i náner óse, ar lendes i şambenna yasse náne i hína.
And taking the child's hand he said to her: Talitha cumi!, which means: “Maiden, I am saying to you, rise!”	Ar mápala i hino má quentes senna: “Talişa cumi!”, ya tea: “Vende, quétan tyenna, á orta!”
And in that moment the maiden arose and walked, for she had twelve years. Then, in the same moment, they were beside themselves with great wonder.	Ar mí yana lú i vende oronte ar vantane, an sámes loar yunque. Tá, mí imya lú, anette ara intu túra elmendanen.
But he commanded them again and again: “Do not let anyone know this!”, and he said that they were to give the maiden something to eat.	Mal cannes tun ata ar ata: “Áva lava aiquenen ista si!”, ar quentes i antumnette i venden nat matien.
And he went away from there and came to his home territory , and his disciples followed him.	Ar oantes talo ar túle atarnómeryanna, ar hildoryar hilyaner se.
When the day of rest came, he started to instruct in the synagogue, and numerous ones among who listened marveled, and they said: “From where did this man receive these things? And what this wisdom that has been given to this man, and such mighty doings that happen by his hands?	Íre i sendare túle, yestanes peanta i yomencoasse, ar rimbali imíca i lastaner tatallaner, ar quentelte: “Mallo nér sina camne nati sine? Ar mana sailie sina ya anaie antaina nér sinan, ar síti taure cariéli yar martar máryanten?
Is he not the carpenter, Mary's son, and the brother of Jacob and Joseph and Judas and Simon? And are his sisters not here with us?” And they would not receive him.	Ma uas i tautamo, Marío yondo, ar hánorya Yácov ar Yósef ar Yúras ar Símon? Ar uar néşaryar sisse aselve?” Ar ualte merne camitas.
But Jesus said to them: “A prophet does not lack praise except at his and among his kin and in his own house.”	Mal Yésus quente téna: “Erutercáno ua pene laitie hequa atarnómeryasse ar mici nosserya ar véra coaryasse.”
And he could not do a single great deed there, except that he put his hands on a few sick ones and healed them.	Ar uas polde care erya taura carda tasse, hequa i panyanes máryat mance engwalissen ar te-nestane.
And he was in wonder about their lack of faith. Then he went from place to place in a circle to the villages, teaching.	Ar anes elmendasse pa penielta saviéva. Tá lendes nómello nómenna rindesse i mastonnar, peantala.
Now he summoned the twelve, and he began sending them , two and two , and he gave them power over the unclean spirits.	Sí tultanes i yunque, ar yestanes menta te, atta ar atta, ar antanes tien túre or i úpoice fairi.
And he commanded them to carry nothing for the journey except a staff alone – not bread, not a food-pouch, not copper in the belt,	Ar cannes tien cole munta i lendan hequa vandil erinqua – lá massa, lá mattapocolle, lá urus i quiltasse,
but they were to bind on themselves shoes, and it was not permitted to them to carry two tunics.	mal nutumnelte intesse hyapat, ar úne tien lávina cole laupe atta.
Furthermore, he said to them: “Every house into which you come, remain there until you go away from that place.	Ente, quentes téna: “Ilya coa mir ya tulilde, á lemya tasse tenna autalde nóme tanallo.
And at every place that does not receive you or hear you, when you go away from there shake off the dust which clings under your feet, as a witness to them.”	Ar ilya nómesse ya ua mere came le hya hlare le, ire autalde talo á pala oa i asto ya himya nu taluldat, ve vettie tien.”
And they went and preached to people for them to find repentance ,	Ar lendelte ar nyardaner quenin hirieltan inwis;
and they threw out many demons and annointed many sick ones with oil and healed them.	ar et-hantelte rimbe raucoli ar lívelte rimbe engwali millonen ar nestaner te.
And King Herod heard about Jesus, for his name was now known widely, and people said: “John the Baptist has been raised from the dead, and therefore the mighty deeds are working in him.”	Ar Aran Herol hlasse pa Yésus, an esserya sí náne sinwa palan, ar queni quenter: “Yoháno i Tumyando anaie ortaina qualinillon, ar etta i taure cardar mólar sesse.”
But others said: “He is Elijah.” Still others said: “He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of the past.”	Mal exeli quenter: “Náse Elía.” En exeli quenter: “Náse Erutercáno, ve quén i Erutercánoron i vanwiéno.”
But when Herod heard it, he said: “That John whose head I cut off, he has been raised!” For Herod himself sent and seized John and bound him, by reason of Heriodias, wife of Philip his brother, since Herod got married to her.	Mal íre Herol hlasse sa, quentes: “Tana Yoháno yeo cas inye aucirne, sé anaie ortaina!” An Herol immo mentane ar nampe Yoháno ar nunte se, castanen Heroliasso, Filip hánoryo veri, pan Herol veryane senna.
For John said to Herod: “You may not have your brother's wife.”	An Yoháno quente Herolenna: “Ualye lerta same hánolyo veri.”
But Herodias had a hatred for John and wanted to kill him, but could not.	Mal Herolias sáme tevie Yohánova ar merne nahta se, mal ua polde.
For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just and holy man, and he protected him. After hearing him, he was very uncertain about what was the best thing for him to do, and yet he heard him with joy.	An Herol runce Yohánollo, istala i anes faila ar aire nér, ar se-varyanes. Apa hlarie se, anes ita útanca pa mana náne sen i arya nat carien, ananta se-hlasses arwa alasseo.
But a day of opportunity came when Herod, on his birthday, made a feast for the most prominent men and the commanders and the eminent men of Galilee.	Mal aure eciéva túle íre Herol, nónareryasse, carne merende amminde neryain ar i cánoin ar i arátor Alileo.
And Herodias' daughter came herself and danced and pleased Herod and the people at the table with him. The king said to the maiden: “Ask of me anything that you want, and I shall give it to you.”	Ar selyerya Herolias túle immo ar liltane ar fastane Herol ar i queni ara i sarno óse. I aran quente i vendenna: “Cana nillo aiqua ya meritye, ar antuvanyes tyen.”
Indeed he gave her his oath: “Anything that you ask of me, I shall give it do you, until half of my kingdom!”	É antanes sen vandarya: “Aiqua ya canitye nillo, antuvanyes tyen, tenna perta aranienyo!”
And the maiden went out and said to her mother: “What am I to ask?” She said: “John the Baptist's head!”	Ar i vende lende ettenna ar quente amilleryanna: “Mana canuvan?” Eques: “Yoháno i Tumyando cas!”
Quickly she went straight to the king and asked: “I wish that you give me, in this hour, John the Baptist's head on a dish.”	Lintiénen lendes térave i aranna ar canne: “Merin i nin-antal, mi lúme sina, Yoháno i Tumyando cas venesse!”
Deep grief seized the king, and yet he did not want to reject that the maiden asked, since he gave his oaths before the people at the table.	Tumna nyére nampe i aran, ananta uas merne váquete ya i vende canne, pan antanes vandaryar epe i queni ara i sarno.
Thus, in the same moment, the king sent his bodyguard, commanding him to bring John's head. And he went away and cut off his head in the prison.	Sie, mí imya lú, i aran mentane hroacundo, cánala sen tala Yoháno cas. Ar lendes oa ar aucirne carya i mandosse.
He boright his head in a dish and gave it to the maiden, and the maiden gave it to her mother.	Talles carya venesse ar antane sa i venden, ar i vende antane sa amilleryan.
When his disciples heard it, they came and took up his corpse and put it in a tomb.	Íre hildoryar hlasser sa, túlelte ar ortaner loicorya ar sa-panyaner noirisse.
And the disciples gathered before Jesus and told him all the things that they did and taught.	Ar i hildor ocomner epe Yésus ar nyarner sen ilye i nati yar carnelte ar peantanelte.
And he said to them: “Come, you yourselves alone, to a lonely place and rest a little.” For numerous came and went, and they did not have time even to eat.	Ar quentes téna: “Tula, elde erinque, eressea nómenna ar sera pityave.” An rimbali túler ar oanter, ar ualte sáme lúme yando matien.
And they went away by the boat to a lonely place, they alone.	Ar oantelte i luntenen eressea nómenna, té erinque.
But people saw them when they left, and many knew, and from all the cities they ran there on foot and came before them.	Mal queni te-cenner íre oantelte, ar rimbali sinter, ar ilye i ostollon nornelte tar talanen ar túler nó te.
And when he went out of the boat he saw a great crowd, but his heart went out to them, since they were like sheep without a shepherd. And he began to teach them numerous things.	Ar íre lendes et i luntello cennes hoa şanga, mal endarya etelende senna, pan anelte ve mámar ú mavaro. Ar yestanes peanta tien rimbe natali.
Now the hour was late, and his disciples came to him and said: “The place is lonely, and even now the hour is late.	Sí i lúme náne telwa, ar hildoryar túler senna ar quenter: “I nóme ná eressea, ar yando sí i lúme telwa ná.
Send them away, for them to go to the around-lying fields and villages, to buy themselves food.”	Áte menta oa, menieltan i oscaitala restannar ar mastonnar, mancien inten matso.”
He answered them: “You give them what they are to eat!” Then they said to him: “Are we to go and get breads for two hundred denarii to give to the people to eat?”	Hanquentes téna: “Elde áten anta ya matuvalte!” Tá quentelte senna: “Ma menuvalme ñetien massali lenárin tuxa atta antien i quenin matien?
He said to them: “What number of breads to you have? Go and see!” After inquiring they said: “Five, and also two fishes.”	Quentes téna: “Mana nóte massaron samilde? Mena ar cena!” Apa ceşie quentelte: “Lempe, ar yando hala atta.”
And he commanded all the people to lie down on the green grass, group by group.	Ar cannes ilye i quenin caitie undu i laica salquenna, hosta ara hosta.
And they sat down, row by row, in hundreds and fifties .	Ar hamunelte, téma ara téma, mi tuxali ar lepenquealli.
Taking the five breads and the two fishes he lifted his eyes towards heaven and said a blessing, and he broke the breads and gave them to his disciples, for them to put them before the people, and he divided the two fishes to them.	Mápala i massar lempe ar i hala atta ortanes henyat menelenna ar quente aistie, ar rances i massar ar antane tai hildoryain, panieltan tai epe i queni, ar ciltanes i hala atta illin.
And all among them ate and were filled.	Ar illi mici te manter ar náner quátine.
And they took up bread-pieces, filling twelve baskets, and were also the fishes.	Ar ortanelte massarantali, quantala vircolcar yunque, ar enger yando i halar.
Furthermore, those who ate of the breads were fixe thousand men.	Ente, i manter i massaron náner neri húmi lempe.
Then, quickly, he compelled his disciples to go into the boat and go before himself to the other shore, to Bethsaida, while he sent away the crowd.	Tá, lintiénen, mauyanes hildoryar mene mir i lunte ar lelya nó inse i hyana hrestanna, Vetsairanna, lan sé mentane oa i şanga.
But after saying farewell to them he went up into a mountain to pray.	Mal apa quetie namárie téna lendes ama orontenna hyamien.
Now evening was come, and the boat was in the middle of the sea, but he was alone on land.	Sí şinye náne túlienwa, ar i lunte náne i earo endesse, mal sé náne erinqua i noresse.
And when he saw that to them it was difficult to move forward, for the wind was in their face, around the fourth watch he came to them, walking on the sea, but he wanted to go past them.	Ar íre cennes i tien náne urda levie ompa, an i súre náne cendeleltasse, os i cantea tirisse túles téna, vantala i earesse, mal mernes mene han te.
When they saw him walking on the sea, they thought: “That is a ghost!”, and they cried out.	Íre cenneltes vantala i earesse, sannelte: “Ta ná auşa!”, ar etyámelte.
For all among them saw him and were scared. But in the same moment he spoke to them, and he said to them: “Courage! It is I; do not fear.”	An illi mici te cenner se ar náner ruhtaine. Mal mí imya lú carampes téna, ar quentes téna: “Huore! Inye ná; áva ruce!”
And he came into the boat with them, and the wind died down 	Ar túles mir i lunte aselte, ar i súre firne undu.
But they were filled with great wonder, for they did not get understanding by the breads, but their heart was still hard.	Ono té náner quátine túra elmendanen, an ualte ñente hande i massainen, mal endalta náne en hranga.
And after crossing to the land they came to Gennesareth and fastened the boat there.	Ar apa lahtie i nórenna túlelte Ennesaretenna ar tancer i lunte tasse.
But when they went out of the boat people quickly recognized Jesus,	Mal íre lendelte et i luntello queni lintiénen atsinter Yésus,
and they ran around that entire region, and they started to put all that were sick on stretchers and to carry them to where they heard that he was. And every place where he went into villages and cities and fields, they put the sick ones in the market-places, and they begged of him touch just the rim of his raiment, and all the people touching it were healed.	ar nornelte os i quanda ména tana, ar yestanelte panya illi i náner hlaiwe colmalissen ar colitat yanna hlasselte i anes. Ar ilya nóme yasse lendes mir mastor hya ostor hya restar, panyanelte i hlaiwar mí mancanómi, ar inquelte sello appa eryave larmaryo lane, ar i ilye i queni appala sa náner nestaine.
Now gathered around Jesus the Pharisees and some of the scibes that were come from Jerusalem.	Sí ocomner os Yesus i Farisar ar queneli i parmangolmoron i náner túlienwe Yerúsalemello.
They saw some of his disciples eat their food with unholy – that is, unwashed – hands.	Cennelte queneli hildoryaron máta mattalta alairi – ta ná, alasóvine – mainen.
But Pharisees and all Jews do not eat without washing their hands as far as the elbow, keeping the custom of the ancients,	Mal Farisar ar ilye Yúrar uar mate ú soviéno máltat tenna i óleme, himyala i yáraron sito,
and returning from the market-place they do not eat without cleansing themselves by throwing water. There are numerous other customs that they have received and keep, dipping cups and pitchers and coppers.	ar entúlala i mancanómello ualte mate ú poitiéno inte hatiénen nén. Ear rimbe hyane situli yar acámielte ar hepir, tumyala yulmar ar ulmali ar urusteli.
And the Pharisees the the scribes said to him: “How is that your disciples do not behave according to the custom of the ancients, but eat their food with unholy hands?”	Ar i Farisar ar i parmengolmor maquenter senna: “Manen ná i hildolyar uar lenga ve i yáraron sito, mal matir mattalta alairi mainen?”
He said to them: “Isaiah spoke well as a prophet about you hypocrites , as is written: 'This people gives glory to me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.	Quentes téna: “Yesaia carampe mai ve Erutercáno pa lé imnetyandor, ve ná técina: 'Lie sina nin-anta alcar péltanten, mal endalta ná haira nillo.'
In vain they worship me, teaching Men's teachings.'	Lustave ni-tyerilte, peantala Atanion peantier.'
Abandoning God's commandment you keep men's custom.”	Hehtala Eruo axan himyalde Atanion sito.”
Furthermore, he said to them: “Cleverly you put away God's commandment, in order to keep your own custom.	Ente, quentes téna: “Fincave panyalde oa Eruo axan, himien véra situlda.
For Moses said: Give glory to your father and to your mother, and: Who speaks evil about father or mother will die.	An Móses quente: 'Alye anta alcar atarelyan yo amillelyan,' ar: 'Ye quete ulco pa atar hya amil qualuva.'
But you say: When a man says to his father or to his mother: Anything useful that you were to receive from me is a corban (that is, a gift to God),	Mal lé quetir: Íre nér quete ataryanna hya amilleryanna: 'Aiqua aşea ya camumnetye nillo ná corvan' (ta ná, anna Erun),
you no longer allow him to do a single thing for his father or for his mother.	ualde ambe lave sen care erya nat ataryan hya amilleryan.
Thus, by the custom that you pass on , you cause God's word to lack power. And many similar things you do.”	Sie, i situnen ya antalde voro, tyarilde Eruo quetta pene túre. Ar rimbe vávie natali carilde.”
And again summoning the crowd he said to them: “Listen to me, all of you, and understand!	Ar ata tultala i şanga quentes téna: “Á lasta ninna, illi mici le, ar á hanya!
 is nothing from outside that can make a person unclean by coming into him, but the things that come out from a person are that make him unclean.	Ea munta ettello ya pole care quén úpoica tuliénen minna se, mal i nati yar ettulir quenello nar yar se-carir úpoica.
Hear, whoever has ears to hear !”	Hlara, aiquen ye same hlaru hlarien!”
And when he went into a house, away from the crowd, his disciples asked him about the comparison.	Ar íre lendes mir coa, oa i şangallo, hildoryar maquenter senna pa i sestie.
Then he said to then; “Then you as well lack understanding? Do you know know that nothing from outside that comes into a man can soil him,	Tá quentes téna: “Tá yando elde penir hande? Ma ualde ista i munta ettello ya tule mir nér pole vahta se,
since that goes, not into his heart, but into his entrails, and passes into the sewer .” Thus he indicated that food of every kind is clean.	pan ta lelya, lá mir endarya, mal mir hirdiryar, ar autas mir i aucelie.” Sie tenges i ilya nostaleo matta poica ná.
And he said: “What comes out of a person is what soils a person,	Ar quentes: “Ya tule et quenello ná ya vahta quén,
for from inside, out of men's heart, come the evil thoughts: fornications, thefts, killings,	an mityallo, et atanion endallo, tulir i ulce sanwi: hrupuhtaler, pilwi, nahtier,
cases of marriage-breaking, greedy feelings, wicked deeds, falsehood, loose conduct, evil eye, blasphemy, pride, unreason.	vestaracier, milce felmi, olce cardar, ñaume, lehta lengie, ulca hen, naiquetie, valate, úhande.
All these evils come from inside and soil a person.”	Ilye ulqui sine tulir mityallo ar vahtar quén.”
From there he arose and went into the regions of Tyre and Sidon. And he went into a house and did not wish that anyone was to know, but he could not remain hidden.	Talo orontes ar lende mir i ménar Tíro ar Sírono. Ar lendes mir coa ar ua merne i aiquen istumne, mal uas polde lemya muina.
Soon a woman whose daughter was possessed by an unclean spirit heart about him and came and fell down before his feet.	Rongo nís yeo selye náne haryaina lo úpoica faire hlasse pa se ar túle ar lantane undu epe talyat.
The woman was Greek, of Syro-Phonecian descent, and she petitioned of him that he would throw out the demon from her daughter.	I nís náne Hellenya, Siro-Foinicea ontaleo, ar arcanes sello i et-hatumnes i rauco selyeryallo.
But Jesus said to her: “First let the children fill themselves, for it is not proper to take the bread of the children and to throw it to the dogs.”	Mal Yésus quente senna: “Minyave lava i hínin quate inte, an ua vanima mapa i massa i híniva ar hatitas i huonnar.”
But she answered him: “Yes, Lord, and yet the dogs under the table eat the crumbs of the children.”	Mal hanquentes senna: “Ná, heru, ananta i huor nu i sarno matir i hínion mier.”
Then he said to the woman: “Since you said this, go; the demon has gone out of your daughter.”	Tá quentes i nissenna: “Pan quentes si, mena; i rauco oantie et selyelyallo.”
And the woman went away to her house and found the child lying upon the bed, and the demon was gone.	Ar i nís lende oa coaryanna ar hirne i hína caitala i caimanna, ar i rauco náne vanwa.
And returning from the regions of Tyre, Jesus went through Sidon to the sea of Galilee, up through the middle of the regions where the Ten Cities lay.	Ar entúlala et ménallon Tíro, Yésus lende ter Síron earenna Alileo, ama ter ende i ménaron yassen cainer i Ostor Quean.
Here they brought to him a man who was deaf and dumb, and they petitioned of him that he would put his hand on him.	Sisse tallelte senna nér ye náne hlárelóra ar úpa, ar arcanelte sello i panyumnes márya sesse.
And he led him away from the crowd to a lonely place and put his fingers into the man's ears and, after spitting, he touched his tongue.	Ar se-tulyanes oa i şangallo eressea nómenna ar panyane leperyar mir i nero hlaru ar, apa piutie, appanes lambarya.
After looking up towards heaven Jesus sighed and said to him: “Ephphatha!” – that is: “Be opened!”	Apa yétie ama menelenna Yésus síque ar quente senna: “Effata!” – ta ná: “Na latyaina!”
And his hearing was opened, and the bond of his tongue was loosed, and he spoke normally.	Ar hlárerya náne latyaina, ar lambaryo núte náne lehtaina, ar carampes şanyave.
And he commended them that they would say nothing to anyone, but the more he commanded them, the more they made it known.	Ar canneset i quetumnelte munta aiquenna, mal i ambe te-cannes, i ambe sa-carnelte sinwa.
Indeed they were filled with deepest wonder and said: “He has done all things well, and he causes the deaf to hear and the dumb to speak.”	É anelte quátine antumna elmendanen ar quenter: “Acáries ilye nati mai, ar tyaris i hlárelórar hlare ar i úpar quete!”
In those days, while again there was a huge crowd with him and they had nothing to eat, he summoned his disciples and said to them:	Yane auressen, lan ata enge hoa şanga óse ar sámelte munta matien, tultanes hildoryar ar quente téna:
“My heart goes out to the crowd, for even now they have remained with me for three days, and they have nothing to eat.	“Endanya etelelya i şanganna, an yando sí elémielte asinye ter auri nelde, ar samilte munta matien.
If I send them away home emptyhanded, they will become too tired on the road. Furthermore, some among them have come from afar.”	Qui mentanyet oa marenna lustacumbe, nauvalte acca lumbe i mallesse. Ente, queneli mici te utúlier hairallo.”
But his disciples answered him: “From where will anyone, in this lonely place, get breads sufficient for these people?”	Mal hildoryar hanquenter senna: “Mallo aiquen, eressea nóme sinasse, ñetuva massar fárie sine quenin?”
But he asked them: “What number of breads do you have?” They said: “Seven.”	Mal maquentes téna: “Mana nóte massaron samilde?” Quentelte: “Otso.”
And he commanded the crowd to lie down upon the ground, and he took the seven breads, gave thanks, broke them and gave them to his disciples, for them to put them before the people, and they put them before the crowd.	Ar cannes i şangan caita undu i talamenna, ar nampes i massar otso, antane hantale, rance tai ar antane tai hildoryain, panieltan tai epe i queni, ar panyaneltet epe i şanga.
They had also a few fishes, and after blessing those, he commanded them to put also them before the people.	Sámelte yando mance halali, ar apa aistie tai, cannes tien panya yando tai epe i queni.
And they ate and were filled, and they gathered the remaining pieces, filling seven food-baskets .	Ar mantelte ar náner quátine, ar comyanelte i lemyala rantar, quátala matsocolcar otso.
And yet the number of people was around four thousand. And he sent them away.	Ananta nóte i quenion náne os húmi canta. Ar mentanéset oa.
Then, quickly, he went into the boat with his disciples and came to the regions around Dalmanutha.	Tá, lintiénen, lendes mir i lunte as hildoryar ar túle i ménannar os Lalmanúşa.
Here the Pharisees came out and started to quarrel with him, seeking from him a sign from heaven, in order to test him.	Sisse i Farisar ettúler ar yestaner costa óse, cestala sello tanwa menello, tyastien se.
And he sighted in his spirit and said: “What is the reason that this generation seeks a sign? Truly I say: This generation will not receive a sign.”	Ar síques faireryasse ar quente: “Mana i casta yanen nónare sina cesta tanwa? Násie quetin: Nónare sina ua camuva tanwa.”
And leaving them he went back to the boat and went away to the other shore.	Ar te-hehtala nanwennes i luntenna ar oante i hyana hrestanna.
But they did not remember to bring breads with them, and except for one bread they had nothing in the boat.	Mal ualte renne mapa massar aselte, ar hequa massa er sámelte munta aselte i luntesse.
And he commanded them, saying: “Take head, watch out concerning the leaven of the Pharisees and Herod's leaven.”	Ar cannes tien, quétala: “Cima, ettira pa Farisaron pulmaxe ar Herolo pulmaxe.”
And they had a dispute, one with the other, about their lacking breads.	Ar sámelte cos, quén as i exe, pa penielta massar.
Noticing this, he said to them: “What is your reason for having a dispute about lacking breads? Do you still not perceive and understand? Is your heart slow of understanding?	Tuntala si, quentes téna: “Mana castalda samien cos pa penie massar? Ma en ualte tunta ar hanya? Ma endalda lenca handeo ná?
Having eyes, do you really not see, and having ears, do you really not hear? And do you not recall,	Arwe henduo, lau cenilde, ar arwe hlaruo, lau hlarilde? Ar ma ualde enyale,
when I broke the five breads for the five thousand men, the number of baskets full of pieces you gathered?” They said to him: “Twelve.”	íre rancen i massar lempe i nerin húmi lempe, i nóte vircolcaron quante rantaron comyanelde?” Quentelte senna: “Yunque.”
“When I broke the seven for the four thousand men, what number of big provision baskets full of pieces did you gather?” And they said to him: “Seven.”	“Íre rancen i otso i nerin húmi canta, mana nóte hoe matsocolcaron quante rantaron comyanelde?” Ar quentelte senna: “Otso.”
Then he said to them: “Do you still not understand?”	Tá quentes téna: “Ma en ualde hanya?”
And they came to Bethsaida. Here people carried to him a blind man, and they petitioned of him to touch him.	Ar túlelte Vetsairanna. Sisse queni coller senna lomba nér, ar arcanelte sello appa se.
And he took the blind man's hand and brought him outside of the village, and after spitting at his eyes he put his hands on him and asked him: “Are you seeing anything?”	Ar nampes i cénalóra nero má ar talle se ettenna i masto, ar apa piutie henyanta panyanes máryat sesse ar maquente senna: “Ma cénal aiqua?”
And the man looked up and said: “I see the people, for I look at what seems like walking trees!”	Ar i nér yente ama ar quente: “Cénan i queni, an yétan ya şéya ve vantala aldali!”
Then he again put his hands on his eyes, and he saw fully well; he was restored and saw the shapes of all things.	Tá panyanes ata máryat henyatse, ar cennes aqua mai; anes envinyanta ar cenne i cantar ilye nation.
Then he sent him home, saying: “Do not go into the village!”	Tá se-mentanes marenna, quétala: “Áva lelya mir i masto!”
Jesus and his disciples now went away to the villages in Caesarea Philippi, and on the road he asked his disciples, saying to them: “Who do people say that I am?”	Yésus ar hildoryar sí oanter i mastonnar mi Caisarea-Filippi, ar i mallesse maquentes hildoryannar, quétala téna: “Man queni quetir i nanye?”
They said to him: “John the Baptist, and others: Elijah, and others: One among the prophets.”	Quentelte senna: “Yoháno i Tumyando, ar exeli: Elía, ar exeli: Quén imíca i Erutercánor.”
And he asked them: “But who do you say that I am?” Peter answered him: “You are the Christ!”	Ar maquentes téna: “Mal man elde quetir i nanye?” Péter hanquente senna: “Elye ná i Hristo!”
Then he commanded them firmly that they they were not to tell anyone about him.	Tá cannes tien tulcave i ávalte nyerumne aiquenen pa se.
Furthermore, he started to teach them that it was necessary for the Son of Man to endure numerous tortures and to be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes, and to be slain, and to rise after three days.	Ente, yestanes peanta tien i mauyane i Atanyondon perpere rimbe ñwalmeli ar náve auquerna lo i amyárar ar i hére airimor ar i parmangolmor, ar náve nanca, ar orta apa auri nelde.
Indeed he said that openly. But Peter led him to a private place and started to speak against him.	É quentes ta pantave. Mal Péter se-tulyane véra nómenna ar yestane quete ana se.
But Jesus turned, and seeing his disciples he spoke firmly to Peter, saying: “Begone, Satan, for your thoughts are not God's thoughts, but the ones of men.”	Ono Yésus quernexe, ar cénala hildoryar carampes tulcave Péterenna, quétala: “Heca nillo, Sátan, an sanwelyar uar Eruo sanwi, mal tai atanion.”
Then he summoned the crowd to himself with his disciples and said to them: “If anyone wants to come after me, it is necessary for him to reject himself and lift up his cross and follow me.	Sí yaldes i şanga insenna as hildoryar ar quente téna: “Qui aiquen mere tule apa ni, mauya sen váquete insen ar orta tarwerya ar ni-hilya.
For anyone who wants to save his life, to him it will be lost, but anyone whose life is lost for my good or for the good of the gospel, shall save it.	An aiquen ye mere rehta cuilerya, sen nauvas vanwa, mal aiquen yeo cuile ná vanwa márienyan hya márien i evandilyono, rehtuva sa.
Indeed how is helpful for a person if he receives the whole world, but his life is lost?	É manen aşea ná quenen qui camis i quanda mar, mal cuilerya vanwa ná?
Indeed what will a person give in exchange for his life?	É mana antuva quén quaptalesse cuileryan?
For anyone who is shamed concerning me and my words in this generation that breaks marriage and is full of sin, about him the Son of Man will be shamed when he shall come in his father's glory with the holy angels.”	An aiquen ye ná naityana pa ni ar quattanyar mi nónare sina ya race vestale ar ná quanta úcareo, pa sé i Atanyondo nauva naityana íre tuluvas Ataryo alcaresse as i airi vali.”
Furthermore, he said to them: “Truly I say to you: There are people who are standing here that will by no means taste death before they have seen God's kingdom come in power.”	Ente, quentes téna: “Násie quetin lenna: Ear queneli i tárar sisse i laume tyvavuvar qualme nó ecénielte Eruo aranie túlienwa túresse.”
And after six days Jesus lead away Peter and James and John with himself and brought them into a lofty mountain, they alone. And he was changed before them,	Ar apa auri enque Yésus tulyane oa Péter ar Yácov ar Yoháno as inse ar te-talle mir tára oron, té erinque. Ar anes vistaina epe te,
and his garments glittered with a whiteness far beyond which anyone washing clothes on earth can whiten.	ar larmaryar mirilyaner ninquissenen ambela ya aiquen sóvala lanni cemende pole ninquita.
Furthermore, Elijah and Moses showed themselves to them, and they spoke with Jesus.	Ente, Elía yo Móses tannet intu tien, ar carampette as Yésus.
Then Peter spoke and said to Jesus: “Rabbi, it is good that we are here! Let us erect three tents, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah”	Tá Péter carampe ar quente Yésunna: “Ravi, mára ná i nalme sisse! Alve orta lancoar nelde, er lyen ar er Mósen ar er Elían”
– for he did not know what was the best for him to say, for they were terrified.	– an uas sinte mana náne i arya sen quete, an anelte ruhtaine.
And there was a cloud overshadowing them, and a voice came out of the cloud: “This is my son, the beloved; listen to him!”	Ar enge lumbo teltala te, ar óma túle et i lumbollo: “Si ná yondonya, i melda; á lasta senna!”
Suddenly, when they looked around themselves, they no more saw anyone except Jesus alone.	Rincenen, íre cennelte os inte, ualte ambe cene aiquen aselte hequa Yésus erinqua.
And while they went down from the mountain he commanded them that they were not to tell anyone about that they saw , until after the Son of Man was raised from dead.	Ar lan ununtelte i orontello cannes tien i ávalte nyarumne aiquenna pa yar cennelte, tenna apa i Atanyondo náne ortaina qualinillon.
They heeded the word, but they spoke among themselves about what “rising from the dead” meant.	Cimnelte i quetta, mal carampelte mici inte pa mana “ortie qualinillon” tenge.
And they asked him, saying: “How is that the scribes say that first it is necessary for Elijah to come?”	Ar maquentelte senna, quétala: “Manen ná i quetir i parmangolmor i minyave mauya Elían tule?”
He said to them: “Elijah indeed comes first and shall renew all things, but what is the reason that is written about the Son of Man that it is necessary for him to bear many tortures and to be counted as nothing?	Quentes téna: “Elía é tule minya ar envinyatuva ilye nati, mal mana i casta i ná técina pa i Atanyondo i mauya sen cole rimbe ñwalmeli ar náve nótina ve munta?
But I say to you that Elijah has indeed come, and they did to him everything that they wanted, as is written about him.”	Mal quetin lenna i Elía é utúlie, ar carnelte sen ilqua ya mernelte, ve ná técina pa sé.”
And when they came to the other disciples, they saw a great crowd around them, and scrubes quarrelling with them.	Ar íre túlelte i hyane hildonnar, cennelte hoa şanga os te, ar parmangolmoli costala aselte.
But as soon as the whole crowd saw him, they were startled, and running to him they greeted him.	Mal ve rongo ve i quanda şanga cenne se, anelte captaine, ar nórala senna suilaneltes.
And he asked them: “About what are you having a dispute with them?”	Ar maquentes tello: “Pa mana sámalde cos aselte?”
And one of the crowd answered him: “Teacher, I brought my son to you since he is possessed by a dumb demon, and every time when it seizes him, it throws him to ground, and he foams and grinds his teeth and is made stiff. And I petitioned of your disciples that they would throw it out, but they could not.”	Ar quén i şango hanquente senna: “Peantar, tallen yondoya lyenna pan náse haryaina lo úpa rauco; ar ilya lú yasse se-mapas, se-hatis talamenna, ar falastas ar mule nelciryar ar ná cárina tauca. Ar arcanen hildolyallon i etehatumneltes, mal ualte polde.”
And he spoke and said to them; “Unfaithful generation, how long is it necessary for me to be with you? How long is it necessary for me to endure you? Bring him to me!”	Ar carampes ar quente téna: “Úvoronda nónare, manen andave mauya nin náve aselde? Manen andave mauya nin perpere le? Áse tala ninna! ”
And they brought him to him. But when the spirit saw him, it quickly caused the boy to twitch, and after falling down he was rolling on the ground, foaming.	Ar talleltes senna. Mal íre i faire cenne se, lintiénen tyarnes i seldo rihta, ar apa lantie undu anes pélala i talamesse, falastala.
And Jesus asked his father: “How long has this been happening to him?” He said: “From he was a child.	Ar Yésus maquente ataryallo: “Manen andave si amartie sen?” Eques: “Ho anes hína.
Many times it has thrown him into fire and into water alike, to undo him. But if you can, help us , having mercy on us!”	Rimbe lúli se-aháties mir náre ar mir nén véla, nancarien se. Mal qui polil, áment manya, orávala metse!”
Jesus said to him: “This word: If you can! All things are possible for who believes!”	Yésus quente senna: “Quetta sina: Qui polil! Ilye nati nar cárime yen save!”
In the same moment, crying , the child's father said: “I believe! Help me where I lack believing!”	Mí imya lú, yámala, i híno atar quente: “Savin! Ánin manya yasse penin savie!”
Jesus, when he noticed a crowd gathering, spoke firmly to the unclean spirit, saying to it: “O dumb and deaf spirit, I command you: Pass from him and do not go into him again!”	Yésus, íre túnes şanga ocóma, carampe tulcave i úpoica fairenna, quétala senna: “A úpa ar hlárelóra faire, inye cána lyen: Á auta sello ar áva lelya minna se ata!”
And after crying and causing many spasms it went out; and the boy was as sead. Therefore the majority said: “He has died.”	Ar apa yamie ar tyarie rimbe rihtiéli ettúles; ar i seldo náne ve qualin. Etta i amarimbar quenter: “Aquálies.”
But Jesus took his hand and raised him up, and he arose.	Mal Yésus nampe márya ar ortane se, ar orontes.
And after Jesus went into a house, his disciples asked him while they were alone: “How is that we could not throw it out?”	Ar apa Yésus lende mir coa, hildoryar maquenter senna lan anelte erinque: “Manen ná i elme ua polde et-hatitas?”
And he said to them: “A demon of this sort cannot be thrown out except by prayer.”	Ar quentes téna: “Síte rauco ua et-hátima hequa hyamiénen.”
From there they went away and went through Galilee, but he did not wish that anyone was to know that.	Talo oantelte ar lender ter Alilea, mal uas merne i aiquen istumne ta.
For he taught his disciples and told them: “The Son of Man will be given into the hands of men, and they will kill him, but though he shall be slain, he shall rise after three days.”	An peantanes hildoryain ar nyarne tien: “I Atanyondo nauva antaina mannar atanion, ar nahtuvaltes, mal ómu nauvas nanca, ortuvas apa auri nelde.”
But they did not understand the saying, and they were afraid of asking him.	Mal ualte hanyane i quetie, ar runcelte maquetiello senna.
Again they came into Capernaum. While he was in the house he asked them: “About what did you have a dispute on the road?”	Ar túlelte mir Capernaum. Lan anes i coasse maquentes téna: “Pa mana sámelde cos i mallesse?”
They were silent, for on the road they had a dispute about who among them was greatest.	Anelte quilde, an i mallesse sámelte cos pa man mici te i antúra né.
Therefore he sat down and called the twelve and said to them: “If anyone wishes to be first, it is necessary for him to be last of all and to be everyone's servant.”	Etta hamunes ar yalde i yunque ar quente téna: “Qui aiquen mere náve minya, mauya sen náve métima illion ar náve illion núro.”
And he took a child, made it to stand in their midst and put his arms around it and said to them:	Ar nampes hína, tyarne se tare endeltasse ar panyane rancuryat os se ar quente téna:
“Anyone who receives such children by my name, receives me; and anyone who receives me, does not receive me, but who sent me.”	“Aiquen ye came taiti híni essenyanen, came ní; ar aiquen ye came ni, ua came ni, mal ye ni-mentane.”
John said to him: “Teacher, we saw a person throwing out demons, and we tried to stop him, since he did not follow us.”	Yoháno quente senna: “Peantar, cennelme quén et-háta raucoli, ar névelme pusta se, pan uas vi-hilyane.”
But Jesus said: “Do not try to stop him, for there is no one who will do a mighty deed by my name who will soon speak evil about me.	Mal eque Yésus: “Ávase neve pusta, an ea úquen ye caruva túrea carda essenyanen ye rongo quetuva ulco pa ni.
For who does not stand against us, is for us.	An ye ua tare venna, elven ná.
For anyone who gives you a cup of water to drink because of your being Christ's – truly I say to you, his reward will not be lost to him.	An aiquen ye anta len yulma neno sucien návelyanen Hristova – násie quetin lenna, paityalerya ua nauva vanwa sen.
But anyone who causes the fall of one of these little ones who believe in me, it is better for him if a mill-stone of the kind drawn by an ass is put around his neck, and he is thrown into sea.	Mal aiquen ye tyare i lante queno mici pityar sine i savir nisse, ná arya sen qui mulondo i nostaleo túcina lo pellope ná panyaina os yahtya, ar náse hátina mir ear.
And if your hand is causing your fall, cut it off; going into life without a body-part is better for you than passing with two hands into Gehenna, into the fire that burns forever. 	Ar qui málya tyára lantelya, ása aucire; menie mir coivie ú hroaranto ná lyen arya lá autie arwa má atto mir Ehenna, mir i náre ya urya tennoio. 
And if your foot is causing your fall, cut it off; going lame into life is better for you than being thrown into Gehenna having two feet. 	Ar qui talalya tyára lantelya, ása aucire; menie úlévima mir coivie ná lyen arya lá náve hátina mir Ehenna arwa tál atto. 
And if your eye is causing your fall, throw it away, for going into God's kingdom having one eye is better for you than than being thrown into Gehenna having two eyes,	Ar qui hendelya tyára lanterya, ása hate oa, an menie mir Eruo aranie arwa er hendo ná lyen arya lá náve hátina mir Ehenna arwa hen atto,
where their worm does not die and the fire is not extinguished.	yasse vembelta ua quale ar i náre ua luhtyaina.
For everyone will be made salty with salt.	An ilquen nauva carna singwa singenen.
Salt is good, but if the power of the salt has gone, with what will you give taste to the salt itself? Have salt in yourselves, and keep peace between person and person.”	Singe mára ná, mal qui i singeo túre avánie, mananen antuvalde tyáve i singe imman? Sama singe eldesse, ar hepa raine imbe quén ar quén.”
And from there he arose and came to the regions of Judea and to beyond the Jordan, and again crowds gathered to him, and by his habit he again taught them.	Ar talo orontes ar túle i ménannar Yúreo ar han Yordanna, ar ata şangali ocomner senna, ar haimeryanen ata peantanes tien.
Some Pharisees came to him, and in order to test him they asked of him if a man may divorce his wife.	Farisáli túler senna, ar tyastien se maquentelte senna qui nér lerta lehta inse veriryallo.
He answered and said to them: “What did Moses command you?”	Hanquentes ar eque téna: “Mana Móses canne len?”
They said: “Moses allowed the writing of a letter of dismissal and that one divorces her .”	Quentelte: “Móses láve i tecie tecettava aumentiéva ar i mo lehta inse sello.”
But Jesus said to them: “Because of your hard heart he wrote you this commandment.	Mal Yésus quente téna: “Hranga endaldanen tences len axan sina.
But from creation's beginning He made them male and female.	Mal i ontiéno yestallo carnes tu hanu yo ní.
Therefore a man shall abandon his father and his mother,	Etta nér hehtuva atarya yo amillerya,
and the two shall be one flesh. Thus they are no more two, but one flesh.	ar i atta nauvat er hráve. Sie uatte ambe atta, mal er hráve.
Therefore, which God had made one, man is not to divide.”	Etta, ya Eru acárie er, atan áva cilta.”
While they were in the house the disciples again asked him about this.	Lan anelte i coasse i hildor ata maquenter senna pa si.
And he said to them: “Anyone who divorces his wife and gets married to another commits adultery against her,	Ar quentes téna: “Aiquen ye lehtaxe veriryallo ar verya exenna care vestaracie senna,
and if a woman, after divorsing her husband, gets married to another, she commits adultery.”	ar qui nís, apa lehtie inse veruryallo, verya exenna, caris vestaracie.”
Now people brought to him some children, for him to touch them, but the disciples spoke to them in a harsh manner.	Sí queni taller senna hínali, appieryan te, mal i hildor caramper téna naraca lénen.
But Jesus, seeing this, was wroth and said to them: “Allow the children to come to me; do not try to stop them, for of such ones God's kingdom is.	Ono Yésus, cénala si, náne rusca ar quente téna: “Lava i hínin tule ninna; áva neve pusta te, an taition Eruo aranie ná.
Truly I say to you: Anyone who does not receive God's kingdom as a child , will by no means come into it.”	Násie quetin lenna: Aiquen ye ua came Eruo aranie ve hína, laume tuluva mir sa.”
And he took the children into his arms and blessed them, putting his hands on them.	Ar nampes i hini mir rancuryat ar aistane te, panyala máryat tesse.
And when he went off on his way, a man ran to him and fell to his knees before him and asked of him: “Good teacher, what is necessary for me to do, in order to be heir of eternal life?”	Ar íre oantes tieryasse, nér norne senna ar lantane occaryanta epe se ar maquente senna: “Mane peantar, mana mauya nin care, náven aryon oira coiviéno?”
Jesus said to him: “How is that you call me good? No one is good, except one, God.	Yésus quente senna: “Manen ná i estal ní mane? Úquen mane ná, hequa er, Eru.
The commandments you know: Do not kill, do not commit adultery , do not steal, do not speak untrue witness, do not be false, give glory to your father and to your mother.”	I axani istal: Áva nahta, áva care vestaracie, áva pile, áva quete únanwa vettie, áva na ñauna, á anta alcar atarelyan yo amillelyan.”
The man said to him: “Teacher, all these things I have kept from my youth.”	I nér quente senna: “Peantar, ilye nati sine ihímien néşenyallo.”
Jesus looked at him and loved him, and he said to him: “One thing you lack. Go, sell everything that you have and give it to poor, and you shall have a treasure in heaven. Then come and follow me.”	Yésus yente se ar méle se, ar quentes senna: “Er nat penil. Mena, vaca ilqua ya samil ar ása anta penyain, ar samuval harma menelde. Tá tula ar áni hilya.”
But his heart fell at the saying, and he went away in grief, for he had many goods.	Mal endarya lantane i quetiénen, ar oantes nyéresse, an sámes rimbe armali.
After looking from person to person Jesus said to his disciples: “How difficult coming into God's kingdom is for people having money!”	Apa yétie quenello quenenna Yésus quente hildoryannar: “Manen urda tule mir Eruo aranie ná quenin arwe telpeo!”
But his disciples marveled at his words. But Jesus spoke again and said to them: “Children, how difficult coming into God's kingdom is!	Mal hildoryar tatallaner quettaryainen. Ono Yésus carampe ata ar quente téna: “Híni, manen urda tule mir Eruo aranie ná!
For a camel to go through a needle's eye is easier than for a rich person to come into God's kingdom.”	Ulumpen mene ter nelmo assa ná ancárima lá lára quenen tule mir Eruo aranie.”
They were completely startled and said among themselves: “Then who can be saved?”	Anelte aqua captaine ar quenter mici inte: “Tá man pole náve rehtaina?”
Looking at them, Jesus said: “To men it is impossible, but not to God, for all things are possible to God.”	Yétala te, Yésus quente: “Atanin nas úcárima, mal lá Erun, an ilye nati nar cárime Erun.”
Peter began to say to him: “Behold, we have abandoned everything and have followed you.”	Péter yestane quete senna: “Yé, elme ehehtier ilqua ar ihílier lyé.”
Jesus said: “Truly I say to you: is no one who has abandoned house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or fields for my good or for the good of the gospel,	Eque Yésus: “Násie quetin lenna: Ea úquen ye ehehtie coa hya hánor hya amil hya néşar hya atar hya híni hya restar márienyan ar márien i evandilyono,
who will not receive a hundred added measures in this age, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and fields, with persecutions – and in the coming age eternal life.	ye ua camuva napánine lestar tuxa mi randa sina, coar ar hánor ar néşar ar amilli ar híni ar restar, as roitier – ar mí túlala randa oira coivie.
But many who are first shall be last, and the last ones first.”	Mal rimbali i nar minye nauvar métime, ar i métimar minye.”
Now they were on the road rising towards Jerusalem, and Jesus went before them. And they were in wonder, but who followed were afraid. Again he brought the twelve to a private place and began to speak to them about that were going to happen to him: “Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be given over to the chief priests and to the scribes, and they shall judge him to death and give him over to the gentiles,	Sí anelte i mallesse ortala Yerúsalemenna, ar Yésus lende epe te. Ar anelte elmendasse, mal i hilyaner runcer. Ata talles i yunque véra nómenna ar yestane carpa téna pa yar martumner sen: “Yé, lelyealve ama Yerúsalemenna, ar i Atanyondo nauva antaina olla i hére airimoin ar i parmangolmoin, ar namuvaltes qualmen ar antuvar se olla i nóreain,
and they will laugh at him with scorn and will spit at him and will flog him and will kill him, but after three days he shall rise.”	ar laluvalte senna yaiwenen ar piutuvar senna ar se-riptuvar ar se-nahtuvar, mal apa auri nelde ortuvas.”
And James and John, the two sons of Zebedee, came to him and said to him: “Teacher, we wish that you will to for us what we ask of you.”	Ar Yácov ar Yoháno, yondo atta Severaio, túlet senna ar quentet senna: “Peantar, merimme i caruval ment ya arcamme lyello.”
He said to them: “What do you wish that I will do for you?”	Quentes túna: “Mana meriste i caruvan lent?”
They said to him: “Give us that we will sit, one by your right hand and one by your left hand, in your glory.”	Quenteste senna: “Áment anta i haruvamme, quén ara formalya ar quén ara hyarmalya, alcarelyasse.”
But Jesus said to them: “You do not know what you are asking. Can you drink the cup that I am drinking, or be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?” They said: “We can.” Then Jesus said to them: “The cup that I am drinking you shall drink, and the baptism with which I am baptized you shall be baptized.	Mal Yésus quente túna: “Uaste ista ya arceaste. Ma poliste suce i yulma ya inye súca, hya náve tumyaine i tumyalénen yanen inye ná tumyaina?” Quentette: “Polimme.” Tá Yésus quente túna: “I yulma ya inye súca sucuvaste, ar i tumyalénen yanen inye ná tumyaina nauvaste tumyaine.
But the sitting down at my right or at my left is not for me to give, but it is for the people to whom it has been reserved.”	Ono i harie undu foryanyasse hya hyaryanyasse ua nin antien, mal nas i quenin in anaies sátina.”
When the other ten heard about this, they began to be angry with James and John.	Íre i hyane quean hlasser pa si, yestanelte náve rúşie Yácovenna ar Yohánonna.
But having called them to himself, Jesus said to them: “As you know, the people who seem to be lords of nations have lordship over them, and their great ones have power over them.	Mal yaliéla te insenna, Yésus quente téna: “Ve istalde, i queni i şéyar náve nórion heruvi samir hére or te, ar túraltar samir túre or te.
But it is not so among you. On the contrary, for anyone who wishes to be great among you it is necessary to be your servant,	Mal ua ea sie mici lé. Úsie, aiquenen ye mere náve túra mici lé mauya náve núrolda,
and for anyone who wishes to be first among you it is necessary to be slave of all.	ar aiquenen ye mere náve minya mici lé mauya náve illion mól.
For also the Son of Man came, not to have servants, but to be a servant and to give his life as a ransom in exchange for numerous ones.	An yando i Atanyondo túle, lá samien núror, mal náven núro ar antien cuilerya ve nanwere quaptalesse rimbalin.”
And they came into Jericho. But while he and his disciples and a great crowd were on their way out of Jericho, Bartimaeus the son of Timaeus, a bind beggar, sat by the road.	Ar túlelte mir Yerico. Mal lan sé ar hildoryar ar hoa şanga náner tieltasse et Yericollo, Vartiméo yondorya Timéo, lomba iquindo, hamne ara i malle.
When he heard that this was Jesus from Nazareth, he began to shout and say: “Son of David, Jesus, have mercy on me!”	Íre hlasses i si náne Yésus Nasaretello, yestanes yame ar quete: “Lavirion, Yésus, órava nisse!”
Then many spoke firmly to him for him to be silent , but the more he cried: “Son of David, have mercy on me!”	Tá rimbali caramper tulcave senna náveryan quilda, mal i ambe yámes: “Lavirion, órava nisse!”
And having halted Jesus said: “Call him!” And they called the blind man, saying to him: “Courage! Rise, he is calling you!”	Ar hautiéla Yésus quente: “Áse yale!” Ar yaldelte i lomba nér, quétala senna: “Huore! Á orta, lye-yálas!”
Throwing off his cloak he leaped up and came to Jesus.	Hátala oa collarya campes ama ar túle Yésunna.
And Jesus spoke to him and said: “What do you wish that I am to do for you?” The blind man said to him: “Rabboni, let me receive sight.”	Ar Yésus carampe senna ar quente: “Mana meril i caruvan lyen?” I lomba nér quente senna: “Rappóni, lava nin came céne.”
And Jesus said to him: “Go! Your faith has saved you.” And in the same moment he received sight, and he followed him on the road.	Ar Yésus quente senna: “Mena! Savielya erehtie lye.” Ar mí imya lú camnes céne, ar se-hilyanes i mallesse.
And when they came near to Jerusalem, towards Bethphage and Bethany and the Mount of Olives, he sent to of his disciples	Ar íre túlelte hare Yérusalemenna, ana Vet-Fahe ar Vetánia ara Oron Milpioiva, mentanes atta hildoryaron
and said to them: “Go into yonder village before you, and as soon as you come into it, you will find a colt bound, that no one of men has sat upon until now; loose it and lead it hither.	ar quente túna: “Mena mir enta masto epe let, ar ve rongo ve tuliste minna sa, hiruvaste pellope nútina, yesse úquen atanion ahámie tenna sí; áse lehta ar áse tulya sir.
And if anyone says to you: What is your reason for doing this?, then say: The Lord has need of it, and soon he will send it back.”	Ar qui aiquen quete lenta: Mana castasta carien si? – tá queta: I Heru same maure séva, ar rongo se-nanwentuvas.”
And they went off and found the colt bound by the boor, on the outside in the side-street, and they loosed it.	Ar oantette ar hirnet i pellope nútina ara i fenna, mí ette i aramallesse, ar lehtanettes.
But some among those who stood there said to them: “What are you doing loosing the colt?”	Mal queneli imíca i tarner tasse quenter túna: “Mana cáraste lehtala i pellope?”
They said to them just as Jesus commanded, and they let them go off.	Quentette téna aqua ve Yésus canne, ar lávelte tun auta.
And they brought the colt to Jesus, and they put their clothes on it, and Jesus sat upon it.	Ar tallette i pellope Yésunna, ar panyanette collattar sesse, ar Yésus hamne sesse.
Furthermore, many put their cloaks on the road, but others cut branches from the fields.	Ente, rimbali pantaner collaltar i mallesse, mal exeli cirner olvali i restallon.
And who went before him and who came behind him cried: “Hosanna! Blessed be who is coming in the name of the Lord!	Ar i lender epe se ar i túler ca se yámer: “Hosanna! Na aistana ye túla i Héruo essenen!
Blessed be the coming kingdom of David our father! Hosanna in the high places!”	Na aistana i túlala aranie Lavir atarelvo! Hosanna i tarmenissen!”
And he went into Jerusalem, into the temple, and he looked at all things. But even then the hour was late, and so he wet out to Bethany with the twelve.	Ar lendes mir Yerúsalem, mir i corda, ar yentes ilye nati. Mal yando tá i lúme náne telwa, ar sie etelendes Vetánianna as i yunque.
On the following day, when they had come out of Bethany, he was hungry.	I hilyala auresse, íre anelte túlienwe et Vetániallo, anes maita.
From afar he saw a fig tree with leaves, and he went to see if maybe he would find some figs on it. But when he came to it, he found nothing except leaves, for that was not the time of figs.	Hairallo cennes relyávalda arwa lasselion, ar lendes cenien qui cé hirumnes relyáveli sesse. Mal íre túles senna, hirnes munta hequa lasseli, an ta úne i lúme relyávion.
And he spoke and said: “May nobody ever eat fruit from you again!” And his disciples heard it.	Ar carampes ar quente senna: “Nai úquen oi matuva yáve lyello ata!” Ar hildoryar hlasser sa.
Now they came to Jerusalem. There he went into the temple and started to throw out those who sold and traded to themselves in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the people who exchanged money and the chairs of who sold doves,	Sí túlelte Yerúsalemenna. Tasse lendes mir i corda ar yestane et-hate i vancer ar i mancaner inten i cordasse, ar nuquernes i sarnor i queniva i quaptaner telpe ar i hammar iva vancer cucuar,
and he did not allow anyone to carry a tool through the temple.	ar uas láve aiquenen cole tamma ter i corda.
But he taught and said to it: “Is not written: 'My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations?' But you have made it a cave of robbers!”	Mal peantanes ar quentes: “Ma ua técina: 'Coanya nauva estaina coa hyamiéva ilye i nórin'? Mal elde acárier sa rotto piluiva!”
And the chief priests heard it, and they sought how they could undo him, for they feared him, for his teaching filled the entire crowd with wonder.	Ar i hére airimor hlasser sa, ar cestanelte manen ence ten nancare se, an runcelte sello, an peantierya quante i quanda şanga elmendanen.
When the hour was late, they went out of the city.	Íre i lúme náne telwa, lendelte et i ostollo.
But when they passed by in an early hour, they saw the fig tree withered up from the roots.	Mal íre lahtanelte arinya lúmesse, cennelte i relyávalda hestiéla i şundullon.
And recalling it, Peter said to him: “Rabbi ,behold! The fig tree that you cursed is withered up.”	Ar enyálala sa, Péter quente senna: “Rappi, ela! I relyávalda ye huntel hestiéla ná.”
And he answered and said: “Have faith in God.	Ar hanquentes ar eque: “Sama savie Erusse.
Truly I say to you that anyone who says to this mountain: 'Be lifted up and thrown into sea!', and he is not uncertain in his heart but believes that what he is saying will happen, for him it will happen.	Násie quetin lenna i aiquen ye quete sina orontenna: 'Na ortaina ar hátina mir ear!', ar uas útanca endaryasse mal save i ya quétas martuva, sen martuvas.
Therefore I say to you: All the things about which you pray and petition, believe that you have received them, and that will happen for you.	Etta quetin lenna: Ilye i nati pa yar hyamilde ar arcalde, sava i acámieldet, ar ta martuva len.
And when you stand praying, forgive anything that you have against anyone. Then your Father who is in heaven will also forgive you your crimes.” 	Ar íre tarilde hyámala, apsena aiqua ya samilde aiquenna. Tá Atarelda ye ea menelde yando apsenuva len ongweldar.” 
And they came again to Jerusalem. Then the chief priests and the scribes and the elders came to him	Ar túlelte ata Yerúsalemenna. Tá i hére airimor ar i parmangolmor ar i amyárar túler senna
and said to him: “What is your authority for doing these things? Or who gave you this authority for doing these things?”	ar quenter senna: “Mana hérelya carien nati sine? Hya man antane lyen hére sina carien nati sine?”
Jesus said to them: “I will ask you one question. You answer me, and I too will tell you about the authority with which I do these things.	Yésus quente téna: “Maquetuvan lello maquetie er. Alde hanquete nin, ar yando inye nyaruva len pa i hére yanen carin nati sine.
John's baptism, was it from heaven or from men? Answer me!”	Yoháno tumyale, ma anes menello hya atanillon? Ánin hanquete!”
And they considered it among themselves, saying: “If we say: From heaven, he will say: Then how is that you did not believe in him?	Ar carnelte úvie mici inte, quétala: “Qui quetilve: Menello, quetuvas: Tá manen ná i ualde sáve sesse?
But dare we say: From men – ?” They feared the crowd, for all the people believed that John indeed was a prophet.	Mal ma veryalve quete: Atanillon – ?” Runcelte i şangallo, an ilye i queni sáver i Yoháno é náne Erutercáno.
And they answered Jesus and said: “We do not know.” And Jesus said to them: “Then I too refuse to tell you about the authority by which I do these things.”	Ar hanquentelte Yésunna ar quenter: “Ualme ista.” Ar Yésus quente téna: “Tá yando inye váquete nyare len pa i hére yanen carin nati sine.”
And he began to say to them with comparisons:“A man planted a garden of vines , surrounded it with a fence, dug a hollow for the vine-press and built a tower. Then he let cultivators use it for money, and went to a foreign country.	Ar yestanes quete téna sestielínen: “Nér empanne tarwa liantassion, pelle sa pelonen, sampe unque i limpevorman ar carastane mindo. Tá láves alamólin yuhta sa telpen, ar lende ettelea nórenna.
When the time came, he sent a slave to the cultivators in order to receive from the cultivators some fruits from the garden.	Íre i lúme túle, mentanes mól i alamonnar camien i alamollon yáveli i tarwallo.
But they took the slave, beat him and sent him away empty.	Mal nampelte i mól, se-palpaner ar se-menter oa lusta.
And again he sent to them another slave, and him they hit on the head and behaved towards him with scorn.	Ar ata mentanes téna hyana mól, ar sé pentelte i caresse ar lenganer senna yaiwenen.
And another he sent, and him they killed, and numerous others: Some they flayed and some they killed.	Ar exe mentanes, ar sé nacantelte, ar rimbe exeli: Queneli rípelte ar queneli nacantelte.
There was with him one more, a beloved son. He sent to him to them last, saying: “They will have awe for my son.”	Enge óse an er, melda yondo. Mentanes téna sé métima, quétala: “Samuvalte áya yondonyan.”
But the cultivators said among themselves: “This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, and we shall possess the part of the heir!”	Mal i alamor quenter mici inte: 'Si ná i aryon. Tula, alve nahta se, ar elve haryuvar i aryono masse!'
And they took him and killed him, and they threw him out of the garden.	Ar nampeltes ar nacanter se, ar hanteltes et i tarwallo.
What, then, shall the garden-master do? He shall come and shall destroy the cultivators and will give the garden to others.	Mana, tá, caruva i tarwantur? Tuluvas ar nancaruvas i alamor ar antuvas i tarwa exelin.
Did you really not read this scripture? 'The stone which the builders turned away, it has become head of the corner.	Lau hentanelde tehtele sina? 'I ondo ya i şamnor querner oa, sá olólie cas i vinco.
From the Lord this thing has come, and it is a wonder in our eyes.'”	I Hérullo nat sina utúlie, ar nás elmenda hendulmatse.'”
And they tried to seize him, but they feared the crowd. For they knew that about them he spoke the comparison. And they went from him and went off.	Ar rincelte mapa se, mal runcelte i şangallo. An sintelte i pa té quentes i sestie. Ar lendelte sello ar oanter.
Then they sent to him some of the Pharisees and Herodians, in order to catch him in his speech.	Tá mentanelte senna queneli Farisaron ar Heroldilion, mapien se questaryasse.
After coming to him they said to him: “Teacher, we know that you are true and does not heed anyone, for you do not look at men's faces, but teach God's way in truth: May we pay tax to the high king , or not? Is it necessary for us to pay, or not do pay?”	Apa tulie senna quentelte senna: “Peantar, istalme i nalye nanwa ar ua cime aiquen, an ualye yéta atanion cendele, mal peantalye Eruo malle nanwiesse: Ma lertalme paitya tungwe i ingaranen, hya lá? Ma mauya men paitya, hya lá paitya?”
But he, perceiving their hypocrisy, said to them: “What is your reason for testing me? Bring me a denarius, for me to see it!”	Mal sé, tuntala imnetyalelta, quente téna: “Mana castalda tyastien ni? Á tala ninna lenár, cenienyan sa!”
They brought him one. And he said to them: “Whose is this picture, and the writing?” They said to him: “The High King's.”	Té taller sen er. Ar quentes téna: “Mano ná emma sina, ar i tecie?” Té quenter senna: “I Ingarano.”
Then Jesus said to them: “Pay back to the High King the High King's things, but God's things to God.” And they were in wonder concerning him.	Tá Yésus quente téna: “Á nampaitya i Ingaranen i Ingarano nati, mal Eruo nati Erun.” Ar anelte elmendasse pa se.
Then came to him some Sadducees, who say that there is not resurrection, and they said to him:	Tá túler senna Sarducali, i quetir i ua ea enortie, ar maquentelte senna:
“Teacher, Moses wrote to us that if anyone's brother dies and leaves a wife, but there was no child with him, compels for his brother to marry the woman and raise up seed for his brother.	“Peantar, Móses tence ven i qui aiqueno háno quale ar hehta veri, mal ua enge hína óse, mauya hánoryan verya i nissenna ar orta erde hánoryan.
There were seven brothers, and the first married a woman, but when he died, he did not leave seed .	Enger hánor otso, ar i minya veryane nissenna, mal íre qualles, uas hehtane erde.
And the second married her, but he died without leaving seed, and so also the third.	Ar i attea veryane senna, mal qualles ú hehtiéno erde, ar sie yando i neldea.
Indeed all the seven did not leave seed. Last of all the woman also died.	É ilye i otso uar hehtane erde. Métima illion i nís yando qualle.
In the resurrection, when they shall rise, who among the men will have her as wife? For she was wife of all seven men.”	I enortiesse, íre oryuvalte, man imíca i neri se-samuva ve veri? An anes veri ilye nerion otso.”
Jesus said to them: “Is not this the reason of your mistake, your failing to know the Scriptures and God's power alike?	Yésus quente téna: “Ma si ua loimaldo casta, loitielda ista i Tehtele ar Eruo túre véla?
For when they rise from the dead, men do not marry and women are not given in marriage, bu they are as the angels in heaven.	An íre oryuvalte qualinillon, neri uar verya ar nissi uar vertaine, mal nalte ve vali menelde.
But concerning the dead, that they are raised, did you not read in the book of Moses, in the story of the thorn-bush, how God said to him: “I Abraham's God and Isaac's God and Jacob's God' – ?”	Mal pa qualini, i nalte ortaine, ma ualde hentane Móseo parmasse, nyarnasse i neceltusso, manen Eru quente senna: 'Inye Avrahámo Aino ar Ísaco Aino ar Yácovo Aino' – ?
He is not God of the dead, but of living. You err to a wide extent.”	Uas qualinion Aino, mal cuinaron. Loitalde palan.”
And after hearing their quarrel, one of the scribes came near, for he perceived that Jesus answered them well. He asked him: “What is the first of all commandments?”	Ar apa hlarie costelta, quén i parmangolmoron túle hare, an túnes i Yésus hanquente téna mai. Maquentes senna: “Mana ná i minya ilye axanion?”
Jesus answered: “The first is: Hear, Israel! The Lord our God, the Lord is one;	Yésus hanquente: “I minya ná: Hlara, Israel! I Héru Ainolva, i Héru ná er,
and you are to love the Lord your God with your whole heart and your whole soul and your whole mind and your whole might.	ar alye mele i Héru Ainolya quanda endalyanen ar quanda fealyanen ar quanda sámalyanen ar quanda melehtelyanen.
The second is this: You are to love your neighbor as yourself. There is not commandment greater than these.	I attea ná si: Alye mele armarolya ve imle. Lá ea hyana axan túra epe sine.”
The scribe said to him: “Teacher, you spoke well as is true: He is one, and there is nobody except him;	I parmangolmo quente senna: “Peantar, quentel mai ve nanwa ná: Náse er, ar ea úquen hequa sé;
and loving him with one's whole heart and whole understanding and whole might, and loving one's neighbor as oneself, is far more valuable than all burnt sacrifices and slain sacrifices.	ar melie sé i quanda endanen ar i quanda handenen ar i quanda melehtenen, ar melie queno armaro ve immo, ná mirwa ambela ilye urtaine yancar ar nancayancar.”
Then Jesus, noticing that he answered with understanding, said to him: “You are not far from God's kingdom.” And nobody more dared to ask him anymore.	Tá Yésus, tuntala i hanquentes handenen, quente senna: “Ualye haira Eruo araniello.” And úquen ambe veryane maquete senna.
But Jesus spoke and said while he taught in the temple: “How is that the scribes say: 'The Christ is David's son' – ?	Ono Yésus carampe ar quente lan peantanes i cordasse: “Manen ná i quetir i parmangolmor: 'I Hristo ná Laviro yondo' – ?
By the Holy Spirit David himself said: “The Lord said to my lord: 'Sit beside my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet.'	I Aire Feanen Lavir immo quente: “I Héru quente herunyanna: 'Hama ara formanya tenna panyan ñottolyar nu talulyat.'
David himself calls him lord; then how is he his son?”And the great crowd listened to him with joy.	Lavir immo esta se heru; tá manen náse yondorya?” Ar i hoa şanga lastane senna alassenen.
And in his teaching he said: “Watch yourselves about the scribes that want to walk in long cloaks and want to be greeted in the market-places	Ar peantieryasse quentes: “Tira inde pa i parmangolmor i merir vanta ande collassen ar merir náve suilaine i mancanómessen
and want the first seats in the synagogues and the most prominent places at the evening meals,	ar merir i minye sondar i yomencoassen ar i amminde nómi i şinyemattissen,
and who devour the houses of widows and make long prayers in order to be seen by others. They will receive a heavier judgment.”	ar i ammatir verulóraron coar ar carir ande hyamier náven cénine lo exi. Té camuvar ambe lunga námie.”
And he sat down near to the treasury and watched how the crowd threw money into the treasury, and many rich ones threw many coins into it.	Ar hamunes hare i harwenna ar tirne manen i şanga hanter telpe mir i harwe; ar rimbe lárali hanter rimbe culustali minna sa.
Then a poor widow came and gave two little copper-pieces, that were not valuable.	Tá penya verulóra túle ar antane pitye urustamitta atta, yat únet mirwe.
And Jesus called his disciples to himself and said to them: “Truly I say to you: This poor widow gave more than all the others who gave to the treasury.	Ar Yésus yalde hildoryar insenna ar quente téna: “Násie quetin lenna: Penya verulóra sina antane amba lá ilye i exi i antaner i harwen.
For all among them gave out of their abundance, but she out of her need gave everything that she had, her entire livelihood.”	An illi mici té antaner et úveltallo, mal sé et maureryallo antane ilqua ya sámes, quanda laulestarya.”
And when he went out from the temple one among his disciples said to him: “Teacher, look! Behold the stones and behold the buildings! ”	Ar íre lendes et i cordallo quén mici hildoryar quente senna: “Peantar, ela! Yé i ondor ar yé i ataqui!”
But Jesus said to him: “Are you seeing these huge buildings? By no means will stone here remain upon stone that will not be thrown down.”	Mal Yésus quente senna: “Ma cénal hoe ataqui sine? Laume lemyuva sisse ondo ondosse ya ua nauva hátina undu.”
And while he sat on the Mount of Olives across from the temple, Peter and James and Andrew asked him, now that they were alone:	Ar lan hamnes Orontesse Milpioiva olla i cordallo, Péter ar Yácov ar Yoháno ar Andréas maquenter senna, sí íre anelte erinque:
“Tell us, what the time when these things will happen, and what is the sign that all these things will be close to being completed?”	“Nyara men, mana i lúme yasse nati sine martuvar, ar mana i tanwa i ilye nati sine nauvar hari náven telyaine?”
And Jesus began to say to them: “Take heed that nobody will cause you to stray.	Ar Yésus yestane quete téna: “Cima i úquen tyare le ranya.
Numerous ones will come in my name saying: “I he!”, and they will cause numerous ones to stray.	Rimbali tuluvar essenyasse quétala: “Inye sé!”, ar tyaruvalte rimbali ranya.
And when you hear about wars and news of wars, do not be scared! These things will by necessity happen, but the end is not yet.	Ar íre hlarilde pa ohtar ar sinyar ohtaron, áva na ruhtaine! Nati sine maurenen martuvar, mal i metta ua en.
For nation shall arise against nation and kingdom against kingdom, there will be earthquakes in numerous places, there will be famines. These things are a beginning of pains.	An nóre ortuva nórenna ar aranie aranienna, euvar cempaliéli rimbe nómelissen, euvar saiceléli. Nati sine nar yesta naicelion.
And you, watch yourselves! People will give you over to courts , and you will be beaten in synagogues and made to stand before governors and kings concerning me, as a witness to them.	Ar elde, tira inde! Queni antuvar le olla námocombin, ar nauvalde palpaine yomencoassen ar tyárine tare epe nórecánoli ar arani pa inye, ve vettie tien.
And by necessity the gospel will first be made known in all the nations.	Ar maurenen i evandilyon nauva minyave carna sinwa ilye i nóressen.
But when they lead you forward to give you over, do not trouble yourselves beforehand about what you are going to say; but everything that shall be given to you at that time, say that, for you are not the ones who are speaking, but the Holy Spirit .	Mal íre tulyalte le ompa antien le olla, áva tarasta inde nóvo pa mana quetuvalde; mal ilqua ya nauva antaina len mi enta lúme, queta ta, an elde uar i quétar, mal i Aire Fea.
Furthermore, brother shall give brother over to death, and a father a child, and children shall rise against parents and cause their death,	Ente, háno antuva háno olla qualmenna, ar atar hína, ar híni ortuvar nostarunna ar tyaruva qualmetta,
and you will be hated by all concerning my name. But who is enduring to the end, he shall be saved.	ar nauvalde tévine lo illi pa essenya. Mal ye voronwa ná i mettanna, sé nauva rehtaina.
But when you see the Contemptible Thing of Destruction stand where is not its proper place” – let the one who is reading understand – “then it compels for those who are in Judea to flee into the mountains. The map on the roof of his house is not to come down or go inside to take anything out of his house,	Mal íre cenilde i Faica Nat Nancariéva tare yasse ua vanima nómerya” – lava yen hentea hanya – “tá mauya in nar Yúreasse uşe mir i oronti. I nér tópasse coaryo áva tule undu hya mene mityanna mapien aiqua et coaryallo,
and the man in the field is not to return to the place that he came from to get his cloak.	ar i nér i restasse áva nanwene i nómenna yallo túles ñetien collarya.
Woe to the pregnant women and to those who suckle babies in those days!	Horro i lapsarwe nissin ar in tyetir vinimor ente auressen!
Pray that it will not happen in winter,	Hyama i uas martuva hrívesse,
for in those days will come a tribulation of a kind that has not happened from the beginning of the creation that God created until that time, and it will not happen again.	an ente auressen tuluva şangie nostaleo ya ua amartie yestallo i ontiéno ya Eru ontane tenna enta lúme, ar uas martuva ata.
And if the Lord did not stop short the days, there would be flesh at all being saved. But for the chosen ones that he has chosen he has stopped short the days.	Ar qui i Héru ua nuhtane i auri, aqua ua enge hráve nála rehtaina. Mal i cílinain i ícílies unuhties i auri.
And if anyone then says to you: “Behold! Here is the Christ!”, or: “Look, there he is!”, do not believe .	Ar qui aiquen tá quete lenna: 'Yé! Sís ná i Hristo!', hya: 'Ela, tasse náse!', áva save.
For false Christs and false prophets shall arise and will do signs and wonders, in order to cause to stray – if that is possible – the chosen ones.	An huruhristoli ar hurutercánoli ortuvar ar caruvar tanwali ar elmendali, tyarien ranya – qui ta ná cárima – i cílinar.
But you take heed; I have told you everything beforehand.	Mal alde cime; len-anyárien ilqua nóvo.
But in those days, after that tribulation, the Sun will become black, and the Moon will not give its light,	Mal ente auressen, apa enta şangie, Anar oluva morna, ar Işil ua antuva calarya,
and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers that exist in heaven will be shaken.	ar i tinwi lantuvar menello, ar i túri yar ear menelde nauvar páline.
And then they will see the Son of Man come on clouds with mighty power and glory.	Ar tá cenuvalte i Atanyondo túla fanyalissen arwa taura túreo ar alcaro.
Then he will send the angels and will gather his chosen ones from the four winds, from the border of earth to the border of heaven.	Tá mentuvas i vali ar comyuva cílinaryar i súrillon canta, cemeno rénallo menelo rénanna.
From the fig tree learn this comparison: As soon as its branch is made soft and it sprouts its leaves, you know summer is near.	I relyávaldallo para sestie sina: Ve rongo ve olvarya olle musse ar tuias lasseryar, istalde laire hare ná.
Thus you as well, when you see that these things happen, know that he is near, before the doors.	Sie yando elde, íre cenilde i nati sine martar, istar i náse hare, epe i fennar.
Truly I say to you that this generation shall not pass away before all these things happen.	Násie quetin lenna i laume autuva nónare sina nó ilye nati sine martar.
Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.	Menel cemenye autuvat, mal ninye quettar uar autuva.
About that day and hour nobody knows, not the angels in heaven and not the Son, but the Father alone.	Pa enta aure ar lúme úquen ista, lá i vali menelde ar lá i Yondo, mal i Atar erinqua.
Take heed, be awake, for you do not know when the hour shall come.	Cima, na coive, an ualde ista i lú yasse tuluva i lúme.
This is as when a man goes to another country, going away from his house and giving his thralls authority, to everyone concerning his own work, and commanding the gatekeeper to be awake.	Si ná ve íre nér lelya hyana nórenna, autala coaryallo ar antala mólyain hére, ilquenen pa véra molierya, ar cánala i andocundon náve coiva.
Therefore be awake, for you do not know the time when the house-master shall come, late or in the middle of the night or when the cock sounds or early	Etta na coive, an ualde ista i lú yasse i coantur tuluva, telwa hya endesse i lómio hya íre i tocot lamya hya arinya
– that he shall not come suddenly and find you asleep.	– i uas tuluva rincenen ar le-hiruva lorne.
But what I say to you, I say to all: Be awake!”	Mal ya quetin lenna, quetin ilyannar: Na coive!”
Now two days remained before the Passover and the Festival of Unleavened Breads. And the chief priests and the scribes sought how they would seize Jesus with a cunning device and were going to kill him.	Sí aure atta lemnet nó i Lahtie ar i Aşar Alapulúne Massaron. Ar i hére airimor ar i parmangolmor cestaner manen mapumnelte Yésus curunen ar se-nahtumner.
But they said: “Not at the festival, or there will be an uprising among the people!”	Mal quentelte: “Lá i aşaresse, hya euva amortie imíca i lie!”
And while he was at Bethany, at the table in the house of Simon the Leper, came a woman having an stone-box of fragrant oil, genuine nard, very precious. She broke open the box and poured the oil upon Jesus' head.	Ar lan anes Vetaniasse, ara i sarno mi coarya Símon Helmahlaiwa, túle nís arwa ondocolco níşima millo, nanwa alanarda, ole mirwa. Rances panta i colca ar ulyane i millo Yésuo carenna.
Then, by rage, some said among themselves: “What is the reason for throwing away this fragrant oil?	Tá, ahanen, queneli quenter mici inte: “Mana i casta hatien oa níşima millo sina?
For this oil one could sell for a sum of money over three hundred denarii and give it to the poor!” And they were wroth against her.	An millo sina mo polde vace telpenóten or lenári tuxar nelde ar anta sa i penyain!” Ar anelte rúşie senna.
But Jesus said: “Let her be! What is your reason for making things difficult for her? a good deed she has done for me.	Mal Yésus quente: “Lava sen náve! Mana castalda carien nati urde sen? Mára carda acáries nin.
For the poor you always have among you, and whenever you want you can do good for them, but me you do not always have.	An i penyar samilde illume mici le, ar quique merilde polilde care tien márie, mal ní ualde illume same.
She did what she could; beforehand she has put fragrant oil on my body before it is brought to the tomb.	Carnes ya poldes; nóvo apánies níşima millo hroanyasse nó nás talaina i noirinna.
Truly I say to you: In every place where the gospel is made known, in the whole world, also what this woman did will be told to commemorate her.”	Násie quetin lenna: Mi ilya nóme yasse i evandilyon ná carna sinwa, i quanda mardesse, yando ya nís sina carne nauva nyárina enyalien sé.”
And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went away to the chief priests to give Jesus over to them.	Ar Yúras Iscariot, quén i yunqueo, oante i hére airimonnar antien Yésus olla ten.
When they heard it, they were happy and gave him a promise that they would give him money. And he sought how he was going to give Jesus over when it was possible for him.	Íre hlasselte sa, anelte valime ar antaner vanda i antumnelte sen telpe. Ar cestanes manen antumnes Yésus olla íre ence sen.
At the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Breads, when they killed the Pascal sacrifice, his disciples said to him: “To where do you wish that we are to go to prepare, for you to eat the Passover?”	Minya auresse i Aşaro Alapalúne Massaron, íre nacantelte i yanca Lahtiéva, hildoryar quenter senna: “Manna meril i menuvalme manwien, matielyan i Lahtie?”
And he sent two of his disciples and said to them: “Go into the city, an a man carrying a vessel of water will meet you. Follow him,	Ar mentanes atta hildoryaron ar quente túna: “Mena mir i osto, ar nér cólala calpa neno veluva let. Áse hilya,
and where he goes inside say to the master of the house: The Teacher says: Where is my guest-room, where I can eat the Passover with my disciples?”	ar yasse menis minna queta i coanturenna: I Peantar quete: Masse aşalşambenya, yasse ece nin mate i Lahtie as hildonyar?”
And he will show you a great upper hall, with what is needed and prepared. There prepare for us.”	Ar sé tanuva lent hoa oromar, arwa farmeo ar manwaina. Tasse áven manwa.”
And the two disciples went away and went into the city and found everything as he said, and they prepared for the Passover.	Ar i hildo atta oantet ar lendet mir i osto ar hirnet ilqua ve quentes, ar manwanette i Lahtien.
After evening fell he came with the twelve.	Apa şinye lantane túles as i yunque.
And while they were at the table, eating, Jesus said: “Truly I say to you: One among you, who is eating with me, will give me over.”	Ar lan anelte ara i sarno, mátala, Yésus quente: “Násie quetin lenna: Qúen mici lé, ye máta óni, ni-antuva olla.”
The began to have grief and to say to him, one after the other: “Surely I am not he?”	Yestanelte same nyére ar quete senna, quén apa i exe: “Lau inye ná sé?”
He said to them: “He is one of the twelve, who dips with me in the same bowl.	Quentes téna: “Náse quén i yunqueo, ye tumya asinye mir i imya salpe.
The Son of Man indeed goes away, as is written about him, but alas for that man by whom the Son of Man is given over. It was better for that man if he was not born.”	I Atanyondo é auta, ve ná técina pa sé, mal horro sana atanen lo ye i Atanyondo ná antaina olla! Arya náne sana atanen qui únes nóna.”
As they were eating he took a bread, said a blessing, broke it and gave it to them, and he said: “Take it, this is my body.”	Matieltasse nampes massa, quente aistie, rance sa ar antane sa tien, ar eques: “Ása mapa, si hroanya ná.”
And taking a cup he said grace and gave it to them, and all among them drank from it.	Ar mápala yulma quentes hantale ar antane sa tien, ar illi mici te suncer sallo.
And he said to them: “This is my blood, the blood of the covenant, that will be poured out for many.”	Ar quentes téna: “Si sercenya ná, i véreo serce, ya nauva etulyaina rimbalin.
Truly I say to you: I will by no means drink again from the fruit of the vine until that day when I shall drink it new in God's kingdom.”	Násie quetin lenna: Laume sucuvan ata i liantasseo yávello tenna enta aure yasse sucuvanyes vinya mi Eruo aranie.”
And after singing hymns , they went out to the Mount of Olives.	Ar apa lindie airelindeli etelendelte Orontenna Milpioiva.
And Jesus said to them: “All among you shall be caused to fall, for is written: I shall strike the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.	Ar Yésus quente téna: “Illi mici te nauvar tyárine lanta, an ná técina: Petuvan i mavar, ar i mámar nauvar vintaine.
But after I shall be raised I will go before you to Galilee.”	Mal apa nauvan ortaina lelyuvan epe le Alileanna.”
But Peter said to him: “Also if all the others are caused to fall, still I shall not !”	Mal Péter quente senna: “Yando qui ilye i exi nauvar tyárine lanta, en inye lauva!”
Then Jesus said to him: “Truly I say to you: Today, indeed in this night, before a cock sounds two times, thrice you will deny me.”	Tá Yésus quente senna: “Násie quetin lyenna: Síra, é lóme sinasse, nó tocot lamya lú atta, nel ni-laluval.”
But Peter said again and again: “Also if it is necessary for me to die with you, I shall by no means deny you!” So spoke also all the others.	Mal Péter quente ata ar ata: “Yando qui mauya nin quale aselye, laume lye-laluvan!” Sin quenter yando ilye i exi.
Then they came to the place called Gethsemane, and Jesus said to his disciples: “Sit here while I pray.”	Tá túlelte i nómenna estaina Etsemane, ar Yésus quente hildoryannar: “Hama sisse lan hyamin.”
And he brought Peter and James and John with himself, and he began to have oppressive feelings and to be troubled.	Ar talles Péter ar Yácov ar Yoháno as inse, ar yestanes same lumne felmeli ar náve tarastaina.
And he said to them: “My soul is heavy until death with grief. Remain here and keep yourselves awake!”	Ar quentes téna: “Feanya ná lunga tenna qualme nyérenen. Á lemya sisse ar hepa inde coive!”
After going a short walk forward, he fell to earth and prayed that the hour was to pass from him, if that was possible.	Apa menie şinta vanta ompa, lantanes cemenna ar arcane i autumne sello i lúme, qui ta náne cárima.
And he said: “Abba, Father, all things are possible to you; take away this cup from me! And yet not which I want, but which you want!	Ar eques: “Appa, Atar, ilye nati nar cárime tyen; á mapa oa yulma sina nillo! Ananta lá ya inye mere, mal ya tyé mere.”
And he came and found them asleep, and he said to Peter: “Simon, are you asleep? Did you really not have the strength to be awake for one hour?	Ar túles ar hirne te lorne, ar quentes Péterenna: “Símon, ma nalye lorna? Lau sámel melehte náven coiva ter er lúme?
You be awake and pray, that you do not come into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.	Alde na coive ar alde hyame, i ualde tule úsahtienna. I faire mérala ná, mal i hráve milya ná.”
And he went away again and prayed, saying the same word.	Ar ata oantes ar hyamne, quétala i imya quetta.
And again he came and found them asleep, for their eyes were heavy, and they did not know what they were going to answer him.	Ar ata túles ar hirne te lorne, an hendultat nánet lunge, ar ualte sinte mana hanquetumnelte senna.
And he came the third time and said to them: “Are you still asleep and at rest? That is enough! The hour has come! Behold, the Son of Man is given over into the hands of sinners.	Ar túles i neldea lú ar quente téna: “Nalde en lorne ar sende? Ta farya! I lúme utúlie! Yé, i Atanyondo ná antaina olla mannar úcarindolion.
Rise, let us go! Look, who gives me over has come near!”	Á orta, alve lelya! Ela, ye ni-anta olla utúlie hare!”
And in that moment, while Jesus still spoke, came Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a crowd having swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.	Ar mi yana lú, lan Yésus en carampe, túle Yúras, quén i yunqueo, ar óse şanga arwe macillion ar rundalion, ho i hére airimor ar i parmangolmor i amyárar.
 who was going to give him over gave them beforehand a sign, saying: “The person that I kiss, that is he; seize him and lead him away securely.”	Ye se-antumne ollo antane tien nóvo tanwa, quétala: “I quén ye miquin, ta ná sé; áse mapa ar á tulya se oa varnave.”
And when he came there, he went in the same moment to Jesus and said to him: “Rabbi” – and he kissed him.	Ar íre túles tar, lendes mi imya lú Yésunna ar quente senna: “Rappi” – ar minqueses.
Then they put their hands on him and seized him.	Tá panyanelte máltat sesse ar namper se.
But one among who stood there drew his sword and struck the chief priest's slave and cut off his ear.	Mal quén imíca i tarner tasse tunce macilya ar pente i héra airimo mól ar aucirne hlarya.
But Jesus spoke and said to them: “Have you come out with swords and clubs, as against a robber whom you will lead away?	Mal Yésus carampe ar quente téna: “Ma etutúlielde arwe macillion ar rundalion, ve pilunna ye tulyuvalde oa?
Day after day I was with you in the temple teaching, and yet you did not seize me. But it happens to fulfill the Scriptures.”	Aure apa aure anen aselde i cordasse peantala, ananta ualde nampe ni. Mal martas amaquatien i Tehtele.”
And all forsook him and fled.	Ar illi se-hehtaner ar úşer.
But there was a young man who followed him, having a linen raiment over his naked body; and they tried to seize him,	Mal enge nessa nér ye hilyane se, arwa páşelarmo or helda hroarya; ar rincelte mapa se,
but he abandoned the linen raiment and fled naked.	mal hehtanes i páşelarma ar úşe helda.
Now they led Jesus away to the chief priest, and all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes assembled.	Sí tulyanelte Yésus oa i héra airimonna, ar ilye i hére airimor ar i amyárar ar i parmangolmor ocomner.
But Peter from afar followed him into the courtyard of the chief priest, and he was sitting before a fire with the servants to be warm.	Mal Péter hairallo hilyane se mir paca i héra airimóva, ar hámanes epe ruine as i núror náven lauca.
But the chief priests and the entire High Council sought a testimony against Jesus so that they could kill him , but they found nothing.	Ono i hére airimor ar i quanda Tára Combe cestaner vettie Yésunna nahtieltan se, mal hirnelte munta.
Numerous ones gave lying testimony against him,, but the testimonies were not similar .	Rimbali antaner húrala vettie senna, mal i vettier úner vávie.
And some arose and spoke lies against him, saying:	Ar quelli oronter ar quenter huruli senna, quétala:
“We have heard him say: I will thrown down this temple which was built by hands, and in three days I shall build another that is not made by hands.”	“Elme ahlárier se quéta: Hatuvan undu corda sina ya náne cárina mainen, ar ter auri nelde carastuvan exe ya ua cárina mainen.”
But also in this matter their testimony was not similar .	Mal yando mi natto sina vettielta úne vávea.
In the end the chief priest arose in their midst and asked Jesus: “Are you answering nothing? What are the things that these people witness against you?”	I mettasse i héra airimo oronte endaltasse ar maquente Yésunna: “Ma hanquétal munta? Mana i nati yar queni sine vettar lyenna?”
But he was silent and answered nothing. Again the chief priest asked him, and he said: “Are you the Christ, son of the Blessed One?”	Mal anes quilda ar hanquente munta. Ata i héra airimo maquente senna, ar eques: “Ma elye ná i Hristo, yondorya i Aistana?”
And Jesus said: “I am; and you shall see the Son of Man sitting by the right hand of the Power and coming with the clouds of heaven.”	Ar Yésus quente: “Inye ná; ar cenuvalde i Atanyondo hára ara i Túreo forma ar túla as menelo fanyar.”
Then the chief priest tore his tunic and said: “What more need do we have of testimony?	Tá i héra airimo narcane lauperya ar quente: “Mana amba maure samilve vettiéva?
You heard the blasphemy! What do you think?” The judgement of all among them was that he was worthy of death.	Hlasselde i naiquetie! Mana sanalde?” I námie illion mici te náne i anes valda qualmeo.
And some began to spit at him and to cover his face and to strike him and say to him: “Play the prophet!” And striking his face, the court attendants took him away.	Ar quelli yestaner piuta senna ar tope cendelerya ar petitas ar quete senna: “Tyala i Erutercáno!” Ar pétala cendelerya, i námonduri se-namper oa.
Now while Peter was beneath in the court, one among the maidservants came,	Sí lan Péter náne undu i pacasse, quén imíca i núri túle,
and when she saw Peter stand there warming himself, she looked at him and said: “You too was with the man from Nazareth, this Jesus.”	ar íre cennes Péter tára tasse lautala inse, yenteses ar quente: “Yando elye náne as i nér ho Násaret, Yésus sina.”
But he denied it, saying: “I do not know him and I do not understand what you are saying!” Then he went out to the vestibule .	Mal sa-lalanes, quétala: “Uan ista se ar uan hanya ya quétal!” Tá lendes ettenna i andoşambenna.
There the maidservant, seeing him, again started to say to those who stood there: “This man is among them!”	Tasse i núre, cénala se, ata yestane quete innar tarner tasse: “Nér sina ná imica té!”
Again he denied it. And after a short time those who stood there again said to Peter: “Indeed you are among them, for you are from Galilee!”	Ata sa-lalanes. Ar apa şinta lúme i tarner tasse ata quenter Péterenna: “É nalye mici té, an nalye Alileallo!”
But he started to curse and to give his oath: “I do not know this man that you are talking about!”	Mal sé yestane húta ar antane vandarya: “Uan ista nér sina pa ye elde quétar!”
And in the same moment a cock again sounded, and Peter recalled the saying that Jesus said to him: “Before a cock sounds two times, you will deny he thrice.” And he collapsed in tears.	Ar mí imya lú tocot ata lamyane, ar Péter enyalde i quetie ya Yésus quente senna: “Nó tocot lamya lú atta, ni-laluval nel.” Ar talantes nírelissen.
And as soon as dawn came, the chief priest with the elders and the scribes and the entire High Council made a consideration; and they bound Jesus and led him away and gave him over to Pilate.	Ar ve rongo ve ára túle, i héra airimo as i amyárar ar i parmangolmor ar i quanda Tára Combe carner úvie, ar nuntelte Yésus ar tulyaner se oa ar antaner se olla Pilátonna.
And Pilate asked him: “Are you king of the Jews?” He answered: “You say it.”	Ar Piláto maquente senna: “Ma elye ná aran Yúraron?” Sé hanquente: “Elye quete sa.”
But the chief priests said he was done many evils.	Mal i hére airimor quenter i anes cáriéla rimbe ulculi.
And Pilate asked him again, saying: “Are you answering nothing? Behold all the evils that they are saying that you have done!”	Ar Piláto maquente senna ata, quétala: “Ma hanquétal munta? Yé ilye i ulqui yar quétalte i acáriel!”
But Jesus answered nothing more, and that filled Pilate with wonder.	Mal Yésus hanquente munta amba, ar ta quante Piláto elmendanen.
But from festival to festival he freed to them one bound man, the person that they asked for.	Mal aşarello aşarenna leryanes tien nútina nér er, i quén ye arcanelte.
At that time the man called Barabbas was in fetters with those that had risen up , that did murder in their uprising.	Yana lúmesse i nér estaina Varavas náne naxalissen as i amortiélar, i carner nahtie amortieltasse.
And the crowd came up and began to ask that was done to them as the custom was.	Ar i şanga túle ama ar yestane arca i náne carna tien ve i sito né.
But Pilate asked them, saying: “Do you wish that I free to you the king of the Jews?”	Mal Piláto maquente téna, quétala: “Ma merilde i leryan len i aran Yúraron?”
For he knew that envy was what caused the chief priests to give him over.	An sintes i hrúcen náne ya tyarne i hére airimor anta se olla.
But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to ask that he would free to them Barabbas in the place .	Mal i hére airimor valtaner i şanga arcien i leryumnes tien Varavas mí men.
But Pilate asked again and said to them: “Then what do you wish that I am to do to who you call king of the Jews?”	Mal Piláto maquente ata ar quente téna: “Tá mana merilde i caruvan yen estalde aran Yúraron?”
Again they cried: “Crucify him!”	Ata yámelte: “Áse tarwesta!”
But Pilate said to them: “Then what is the evil that he has done?” But they cried with a terrible clamor: “Crucify him!”	Mal Piláto quente téna: “Tá mana i ulco ya acáries?” Ono té yámer rúcima yalmenen: “Áse tarwesta!”
Then Pilate, trying to do what the crowd wanted, freed to them Barabbas.	Tá Piláto, névala care ya i şanga merne, leryane tien Varavas.
But having flayed Jesus he gave him over to be crucified.	Mal riptiéla Yésus se-antanes olla náven tarwestaina.
Then the soldiers led him away into the courtyard, that is the palace, and they gathered the entire soldier-host.	Tá i ohtari se-tulyaner oa mir i paca, ta ná i túrion, ar comyanelte i quanda ohtarhosse.
Then they put on him a purple cloak and made a crown of thorns and put it on him.	Tá panyanelte sesse luicarne colla ar carner ríe necellíva ar sa-panyane sesse.
And they began to greet him: “Good day , king of the Jews!”	Ar yestanelte suila se: “Hara máriesse, aran Yúraron!”
Furthermore, they struck him on his head with a reed and spat at him and went down on their knees and fell down before him.	Ente, penteltes caryasse liscenen ar piutaner senna ar lender undu occaltatse ar lantaner undu epe se.
And having laughed at him with scorn they took from him the purple cloak and put on him his own raiment. Then they brought him outside to crucify him.	Ar láliéla senna yaiwenen nampelte sello i luicarne colla ar panyaner sesse véra larmarya. Tá talleltes ettenna tarwestien se.
And a passing man who came from the field they compelled to bear his cross – Simon from Cyrene, father of Alexander and Rufus.	Ar lahtala nér ye túle i restallo mauyanelte cole tarwerya – Símon Círenello, Alexander ar Rúfuso atar.
And they brought him tot he place called Golgotha, which means Skull Place .	Ar talleltes i nómenna estaina Olyoşa, ya tea Caraxomen.
And they tried to give him wine with a sleep-inducing gum , but he did not want to drink it.	Ar névelte anta sen limpe arwa lornatála suhteo, mal uas merne sucitas.
And they crucified him and distributed his raiments by throwing lots about who was going to get what.	Ar tarwestaneltes ar etsanter larmaryar hatiénen sanwali pa man ñetumne mana.
They crucified him at the third hour.	Tarwestaneltes i neldea lúmesse.
And on the sign indicating the accusation against him was written: “King of the Jews.”	Ar i tanwasse teala i ulquetie senna náne técina: “Aran Yúraron.”
Furthermore, they crucified two robbers with him, one on his right and one on his left. 	Ente, tarwestanelte pilu atta óse, quén foryaryasse ar quén hyaryaryasse. 
And those who passed by blasphemed against him, wagging their head and saying: “Ugh! You who were to throw down the temple and to rebuild it in three days,	Ar i lahtaner naiquenter senna, quequérala carilta ar quétala: “Orro! Elye ye hatumne undu i carda ar encarastumne sa ter auri nelde,
save yourself by coming down from the cross!”	á rehta imle tuliénen undu i tarwello!”
In the same manner also the chief priests, one with the other, laughed at him with scorn with the scribes, saying: “Others he has saved; himself he cannot save.	Mí imya lé yando i hére airimor, quén as i exe, lander senna yaiwenen as i parmangolmor, quétala: “Exeli erehties; inse uas pole rehta.
Let the Christ, king of Israel, come down from the cross that we can see and believe ”. Also those who were crucified with him blasphemed against him.	Nai i Hristo, aran Israélo, tuluva undu i tarwello cenielvan ar savielvan!” Yando i nánet tarwestaine óse naiquentet senna.
When the sixth hour came, darkness fell on the whole land until the ninth hour.	Íre i enquea lúme túle, mornie lantane i quanda nórenna tenna i nertea lúme.
And at the nights hour Jesus cried with a great voice: “Eli, eli, lama sabacthani?”, which means: “My God, my God, what is your reason for abandoning me?”	Ar i nertea lúmesse Yésus yáme túra ómanen: “Eli, eli, lama savahtáni?”, ya tea: “Ainonya, Ainonya, mana castatya hehtien ni?”
And some among who stood there, when they heard that, said: “Listen! He is calling Elijah!”	Ar quelli imíca i tarner hare, íre hlasselte ta, quenter: “Á lasta! Yálas Elía!”
But one ran, filled a sponge with sour wine, put it on a reed, and let him drink, saying: “Let him be! Let us see if Elijah comes to take him down.”	Mal quén norne, quantane hwan sára limpenen, panyane sa liscesse, ar láve sen suce, quétala: “Lava sen náve! Alve cene qui Elía tule se-mapien undu.”
But Jesus cried with a great voice and expired.	Mal Yésus yáme túra ómanen ar effirne.
And the screen in the sanctuary was torn in two, top to bottom .	Ar i fanwa i yánasse náne narcaina mir atta, telmello talmenna.
When the centurion who stood by him, saw that he so expired, he said: “This man was indeed God's Son!”	Íre i tuxantur ye tarne ara se cenne i sie effirnes, quentes: “Nér sina é náne Eruo Yondo!”
There were also some women who were watching from afar. Among them were Mary Magdalene and the Mary who was the mother of James the Younger and of Joses, and Salome,	Enger yando nisseli i tíraner hairallo. Mici té náner María Mahtaléne ar i María ye náne i amil Yácov i Amnesso ar Yóseso, ar Salóme,
who followed him and ministered to him while he was in Galilee, and numerous other women that traveled with him up to Jerusalem.	i hilyaner se ar veuyaner sen lan anes Alileasse, ar rimbe hyane nisseli i lender óse ama Yerúsalemenna.
Now evening was near, and was Preparation, that is, the day before the day of rest.	Sí şinye náne hare, ar náne Manwie, ta ná, i ré nó i sendare.
Therefore Josef of Arimathea came, a well-known man of the Council, who also himself looked forward to the coming of God's kingdom. He dared to go in to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body.	Etta Yósef Arimaşeallo túle, mai-sinwa nér i Combeo, ye yando immo yente ompa Eruo araniéno tulienna. Veryanes mene minna Pilátonna ar arcane Yésuo hroa.
But Pilate could not believe that he died that soon, and he called the centurion and asked him: “Is he now dead?”	Mal Piláton ua ence save i qualles ta rongo, ar yaldes i tuxantur ar maquente senna: “Ma náse sí qualin?”
Told by the centurion that Jesus was indeed dead, he gave the corpse to Joseph.	Nyárina lo i tuxantur i Yésus é náne qualin, antanes i loico Yósefen.
And after buying linen he took him down, and he wrapped him with the linen and put him in a rockhewn tomb , and he rolled a stone before the door of the tomb.	Ar apa mancie insen páşe nampeses undu, ar se-vaitanes i pásenen ar se-panyane hrótanoirisse, ar peltanes ondo epe i noirio fenna.
But Mary Magdalene and Mary mother of Joses saw the place where Jesus was put.	Mal María Mahtaléne ar María amil Yóseso cennet i nóme yasse Yésus náne panyaina.
When the day of rest was over, Mary Magdalene and Mary, mother of James, and Salome, bought spices and came to put ointment on him.	Íre i sendare náne vanwa, María Mahtaléne ar Mária, Yácovo amil, ar Salóme, mancaner inten tyávelasseli ar túler panien laive sesse.
And very early, on the first day of the week, they came to the tomb, after sunrise.	Ar ita arinyave, i otsolo minya auresse, túlelte i noirinna, apa anaróre.
And they were saying, one to the other: “Who will roll away the stone from the tomb for us?”	Ar quétanelte, quén i exenna: “Man peltuva oa i ondo i noirillo men?”
But when they looked up, they saw that the stone was rolled away, though it was very big.	Mal íre yentelte ama, cennelte in i ondo náne peltaina oa, ómu anes ita hoa.
Having gone into the tomb they saw a young man sit on the right, having a white long-tunic , and they were startled.	Méniéla mir i noire cennelte nessa nér háma i foryasse, arwa ninque andalaupeo, ar anelte captaine.
But he said to them: “Do not be startled! You are seeking Jesus from Nazareth, who was crucified. He was raised, he is not here! Look at the place where they put him!	Mal sé quente téna: “Áva na captaine! Cestealde Yésus Násaretello, ye náne tarwestaina. Anes ortaina, uas sisse! Ela i nóme yasse panyaneltes!
But go, tell his disciples and Peter: He will go before you into Galilee. There you will see him, as he said to you.”	Mal mena, nyara hildoryain ar Péteren: Menuvas epe le mir Alilea. Tasse cenuvaldes, ve quentes lenna.”
And after coming outside they fled from the tomb, for they were seized by trembling and were beside themselves, and they told nothing to anyone, for they were afraid.	Ar apa tulie ettenna úşelte i noirillo, an anelte mapaine peliénen ar náner ara inte, ar nyarnelte munta aiquenen, an runcelte.

Abraham begat Isaac, and Isaac begat Jacob, and Jakob begat Juda and his brothers,	Avraham óne Ísac, ar Ísac óne Yácov, ar Yácov óne Yehúra ar hánoryar,
Juda begat Perez and Zerah with Tamar, and Perez begat Hezron, and Hezron begat Ram,	Yehúra óne Peres ar Sera as Tamar, ar Peres óne Hesron, ar Hesron óne Ram,
and Ram begat Amminadab, and Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon,	ar Ram óne Amminarav, ar Amminarav óne Naxon, ar Naxon óne Salmon,
and Salmon begat Boaz with Rahab, and Boaz begat Obed with Ruth, and Obed begat Jesse,	ar Salmon óne Voas as Ráhav, ar Voas óne Óver as Rút, ar Óver óne Yesse,
and Jesse begat David the king. And David begat Solomon by the wife of Uriah,	ar Yesse óne Lavir i aran. Ar Lavir óne Solomon i verinen Úrio,
and Solomon begat Rehoboam, and Rehoboam begat Abijah, and Abijah begat Asa,	ar Solomon óne Rehóvoam, ar Rehóvoam óne Ávia, ar Ávia óne Ása,
and Asa begat Joshaphat, and Joshaphat begat Joram, and Joram begat Uzziah,	ar Ása óne Yóhyafat, ar Yóhyafat óne Yóram, ar Yóram óne Ussia,
and Uzziah begat Jotham, and Jotham begat Ahaz, and Ahaz begat Hezekiah,	ar Ussia óne Yótam, ar Yótam óne Áħas, ar Áħas óne Ħesecia,
and Hezeciah begat Manasseh, and Manasseh begat Amon,	ar Ħesecia óne Manasse, ar Manasse óne Ámon, ar Ámon óne Yosía,
and Amon begat Jeconiah and his brothers, at the time that the people was led away as exiles to Babel .	ar Yosía óne Yeconya ar hánoryar, i lúmesse ya i lie náne tulyana oa ve etyar Vávelenna.
After the deportation to Babel Jeconiah begat Shealtiel, and Shealtiel begat Zerubbabel,	Apa i autulyale Vávelenna Yeconya óne Hyealtiel, ar Hyealtiel óne Seruvável,
and Zerubbabel begad Abiud, and Abiud begat Eliakim, and Eliakim begat Azor,	ar Seruvável óne Áviur, ar Áviur óne Elyacim, ar Elyacim óne Ásor,
and Azor begat Zadok, and Zadok begat Achim, and Achim begat Eliud,	ar Ásor óne Sároc, ar Sároc óne Ácim, ar Ácim óne Eliur,
and Eliud begat Eleazar, ar Eleazar begat Matthan, and Matthan begat Jacob,	ar Eliur óne Eleásar, ar Eleásar óne Mattan, ar Mattan óne Yácov,
and Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary , by whom Jesus, who is called Christ, was born.	ar Yácov óne Yósef verurya María, lo ye Yésus, ye ná estaina Hristo, náne nóna.
Thus all the generations from Abraham to David were fourteen, and from David to the deportation to Babel there are fourteen generations, and from the deportation to Babel to Christ fourteen generations.	Sie ilye i nónari Avrahamello Lavirenna náner canaque, ar Lavirello i autulyalenna Vávelenna ear nónari canaque, ar i autulyalello Vávelenna i Hristonna nónari canaque.
But Jesus Christ was born in this manner: When his mother Mary was obliged to marry Joseph, she was found with child by Holy Spirit, before they were united.	Mal Yésus Hristo náne nóna mi lé sina: Íre amillerya María náne nauta vestien Yósef, anes hírina as hína i Aire Feanen, nó anette ertane.
But Joseph her husband, who was just and did not wish to humiliate her, wanted to release her secretly.	Mal Yósef verurya, ye náne faila ar ua merne nucume se, merne lerya se nuldave.
But after he thought this, behold! the Lord's angel came to him in a dream, saying: “Joseph son of David, do not be afraid of taking Mary your wife to your house, for which is conceived in her is by the Holy Spirit.	Mal apa sannes sin, yé! i Heruo vala túle senna oloresse, quétala: “Yósef Lavirion, áva ruce mapiello María verilya coalyanna, an ya ná nostana sesse i Aire Feanen ná.
She will bear a son, and you will name him Jesus, for he will deliver his people from their sins.”	Coluvas yondo, ar estuvalyes Yésus, an etelehtuvas lierya úcariltallon!”
All these things happened in order to make true which the Lord said by his herald , saying:	Ilye sine nati martaner carien nanwa ya i Heru carampe tercánoryanen, quétala:
“Behold! the maiden will be with child and will bear a son, and they will give him the name Immanuel” – which means “With us God.”	“Yé! i vende nauva as hína ar coluva yondo, ar antauvalte sen i esse Immanuel” – ya tea “Aselve Eru”.
Then Joseph, after his awakening from his sleep, did as the Lord's angel had commanded him, and he took his wife to his house.	Tá Yósef, apa cuivierya húmeryallo, carne ve i Heruo vala cannelyane sen, ar nampes verirya coaryanna.
But he did not know her before she bore a son, and he gave him the name Jesus.	Mal uas sinte se nó coldes yondo, ar antanes sen i esse Yésus.
After Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, in the days of Herod the king, behold! star-gazers from eastern regions came to Jerusalem,	Apa Yésus náne nóna Vet-Lehemesse Yúreo, mi Herol i arano rí, en! elentirmor rómenye ménallon túler Yerúsalemenna,
saying: “Where is who has been born king of the Jews? For in the East we saw his star, and we have come to bow before him.”	quétala: “Masse ná ye anaie nóna aran Yúraron? An Rómesse cennelme tinwerya, ar utúlielme luhtien epe se!”
When he heard this, King Herod was stirred up, and all of Jerusalem with him,	Íre hlasses si, Aran Herol náne valtaina, ar quanda Yerúsalem óse,
and gathering all the chief priests and the scribes among the people, he asked them about where the Christ was to be born.	ar comyala ilye i hére airimor ar i parmangolmor imíca i lie, maquentes téna pa masse i Hristo nauvane nóna.
They said to him: “In Bethlehem of Judea, for so is written by the prophet:	Quentelte senna: “Vet-Lehemesse Yúreo, an sie ná técina lo i Erutercáno:
'And you, Bethlehem of Judea, is by no means the smallest among the governors of Judea; for from you shall come a ruler, who will be a shepherd for my people Israel.”	'Ar elye, Vet-Lehem Yúreo, laume ná i ampitya imíca i cánor Yúreo; an elyello tuluva túro, ye nauva mavar Israel lienyan.' ”
Then Herod secretly summoned the star-gazers and asked them about the first time that they saw the star.	Tá Herol nuldave tultane i elentirmor ar maquente te pa i minya lú ya cennelte i tinwe.
He sent them to Bethlehem saying: “Go, seek the child, and when you have found him, tell me, for me to be able to go to bow before him, I as well.”	Te-mentanes Vet-Lehemenna quétala: “Mena, á cesta i hína, ar íre ihírieldes, nyara nin, polienyan lelya luhtien senna, yú inye!”
When they heard the king they went away, and look! the star that they had seen in the East went before them, until it stopped above the place where the child was.	Íre hlasselte i aran lendelte oa, ar yé! i tinwe ya cennelyanelte Rómesse lende epe te, tenna pustanes or i nóme yasse enge i hína.
Seeing the star gave them great joy.	Cenie i tinwe antane tien túra alasse.
They went inside the house and saw the child with Mary its mother, and falling down they bowed to him. They opened their treasures and gave to him gifts: gold and frankincense and fragrant resin.	Lendelte mir i coa ar cenner i hína as María amillerya, ar lantala undu luhtanelte senna. Pantanelte harmaltar ar antaner sen annali: malta ar ninquima ar níşima suhte.
But when they were told in a dream about the danger of returning to Herod, they went to their land by another road.	Mal íre náne tien nyárina oloresse pa i raxe nanweniéno Herolenna, lendelte nóreltanna hyana mallenen.
After they went away, look! an angel of the Lord showed himself to Joseph in a dream, saying: “Rise, take the child and its mother and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I shall tell you; for Herod will seek the child to kill it.”	Apa oantelte, yé! Héru vala tannexe Yósefen oloresse, quétala: “Á orta, á mapa i hína ar amillerya ar uşa Mirrandorenna, ar á lemya tasse tenna quetuvan lyenna; an Herol cestuva i hína nehtien se!”
And he arose and took the child and its mother with him at night, and he went away to Egypt,	Ar orontes ar nampe i hína ar amillerya óse lómisse, ar oantes Mirrandorenna,
and he remained there until Herod's death. Thus was made true what was said by the Lord through his prophet , saying: “Out of Egypt I called my son.”	ar lemnes tasse tenna Herolo qualme. Sie náne carna anwa ya quétina né lo i Heru tercánoryanen, quétala: “Et Mirrandorello yallen yondonya!”
Then Herod, seeing that he was made a fool by the star-gazers, was filled with great rage, and he sent soldiers to kill all boys in Bethlehem and in all the regions surrounding it, from two years and under that, according to the time of which he had received knowledge from the star-gazers.	Tá Herol, cénala i anes carna auco lo i elentirmor, náne quátina túra ahanen, ar mentanes ohtalli nehtien ilye seldor Vet-Lehemesse ar ilye i ménassen pelila sa, ho loa atta ar nu ta, ve i lúme pa ya camnelyanes istya i elentirmollon.
Then was made true which was spoken through Jeremiah the Prophet, saying:	Tá náne carna anwa ya quétina né ter Yeremía i Erutercáno, quétala:
“A voice was heard in Rama, wailing and great lament – Rachel wailing for her children, and she did not want comfort, for they are gone.”	“Óma náne hlárina Ramasse, yaime ar túra nainie – Ráħel yaimea hínaryain, ar uas merne tiutale, an nalte vanwe!”
After Herod's death, behold! an angel of the Lord showed himself to Joseph in a dream in Egypt,	Apa Herolo qualme, en! Héru vala tannexe Yósefen mi olos Mirrandoresse,
and he said: “Rise, take the child and go into the land of Israel, for those who want to take the child's life are dead.”	ar eques: “Á orta, á mapa i hína ar mena mir Israélo nóre, an i merner mapa i híno cuile nar qualini!”
He arose and took the child and its mother and went into the land of Israel.	Orontes ar nampe i hína ar amillerya ar lende mir Israélo nóre.
But when he heard that Arcelaus ruled in Judea in the place of Herod his father, he feared to go there. In a dream he was told about his danger, and he went away into the region of Galilee.	Mal íre hlasses i Arcelaüs turne Yúreasse nómesse Herol ataryo, runces meniello tar. Oloresse náne sen nyárina pa raxerya, ar oantes mir i ména Alíleo.
He came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth, to make true which was spoken through the prophets: “He will be called a Nazarene.”	Túles ar marne ostosse estaina Násaret, carien nanwa ya náne quétina ter i Erutercánor: “Nauvas estaina Násarya!”
In those days came John the Baptist, making known in the wilderness of Judea:	Yane auressen túle Yoháno i Sumbando, carala sinwa mi ravanda Yúreo:
“Find repentance, for the kingdom of heaven has come near.”	“Hira inwis, an menelo aranie utúlie hare!”
For this man was of whom Isaiah the Prophet spoke when he said: “The voice of person crying in the wilderness: You are to prepare the Lord's way, make his paths straight!”	An nér sina náne pa ye carampe Yesaia i Erutercáno íre quentes: “I óma queno yámala i ravandasse: Alde manwa i Heruo malle, cara tieryar tére!”
John was wrapped in a cloak of hairs of camels and had a leather-belt around his hips, and his food was grasshoppers and wild honey.	Yoháno náne vaina collasse findíva ulumpion ar sáme aluquilta os osweryar, ar matsorya náne salquecápor ar verca lis.
Then Jerusalem and all of Judea and the entire land surrounding Jordan went out to him,	Tá Yerúsalem ar quanda Yúrea ar i quanda nóre pelila Yordan etelender senna,
and they were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.	ar anelte sumbane lo sé Yordan·síresse, etequétala úcareltar.
When he saw many Pharisees and Sadducees come to the baptism, he said to them: “Offspring of serpents, who taught you to escape from the coming wrath?	Íre cennes rimbe Farisali ar Sandúceali túla i sumbienna, quentes téna: “Nónar laucion, man peantane len uşe i túlala rúşello?
Then bear fruit worthy of the repentance!	Tá cola yáve valda i inwisso!
And do not think that you may say to yourselves: 'Our father is Abraham' – for I say to you that God can rise up children to Abraham from these stones.	Ar áva sana i lertalde quete indenna: 'Atarelva Avraham ná' – an inye quete lenna in Eru pole orta ama híni Avrahámen sine sarnillon.
Even now the ax is lying by the roots of the trees: Thus every three that does not bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.	Yando sí i pelecco cáya ara şundor i aldaron: Sie ilya alda ya ua cole mára yáve nauva círina undu ar hátina mir i náre.
I baptize you with water, into repentance. But that comes after me is mightier than I – I am not worthy to take the shoes from his feet. He will baptize you with Holy Spirit and with fire.	Inye sumba le nennen, mir inwis. Mal ye tuluva apa ni ná taura epe ni – inye ua valda mapa i hyapatu talyalto. Sé le-sumbuva Aire Feanen ar nárenen.
His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will cleanse his threshing floor. He will gather his grain into the store, but the chaff he will burn with a fire that nobody can extinguish.	Saltamarya ea máryasse, ar poituvas vattarestarya. Comyauvas orirya mir i haura, mal i ospor urtauvas nárenen ya úquen pole luhtya.
Then Jesus went from Galilee to Jordan and came to John to be baptized by him.	Tá Yésus lende Alíleallo Yordanna ar túle Yohánonna náven sumbana lo se.
But John denied him, and he said: “My need is that I will be baptized by you, and you are coming to me!”	Mal Yoháno váquente senna, ar eques: “Maurenya ná i inye nauva sumbana lo lyé, ar elye túla ninna!”
But in answer Jesus said: “Allow it to happen, for thus it is proper for us to do everything that is just.” Then he allowed him .	Mal hanquentasse Yésus quente: “Ásan lave marta, an sie ná vent vanima care ilqua ya faila ná!” Tá hé láve sen.
After Jesus was baptized he came straightway out of the water, and behold! heaven was opened to him, and he saw God's Spirit coming down upon him like a dove.	Apa Yésus náne sumbana túles térave et i nenello, ar yé! menel náne sen pantana, ar cennes Eruo Faire túla undu senna ve cucua.
Behold! was also a voice from heaven that said: “This is my son, the beloved, with whom I am pleased!”	Yé! yú enge óma menello ya quente: “Si ná yondonya, i melda, yenen nanye fastana!”
Then Jesus was led by the spirit up into the desert, to be tempted by the Devil.	Tá Yésus náne tulyana lo i Faire ama mir i erume, náven sahtana lo i Arauco.
He did not eat for forty days and forty nights, and after this time he was hungry.	Uas mante auressen canaquean ar lómissen canaquean, ar apa lúme sina anes maita.
And the Tempter came to him and said: “If you are God's son, say to these stones: Become breads!”	Ar i Sahtando túle senna ar quente: “Qui elye Eruo yondo ná, queta sine sarninnar: Ola massar!”
But in answer he said: “It is written: Man does not live only by bread, but by every word that comes from God's mouth.”	Mal hanquentasse quentes: “Ná técina: Atan ua coita rie massanen, mal ilya quettanen ya tule Eruo antollo!”
Then the Devil led him to the holy city and put him at the pinnacle of the temple.	Tá i Arauco se-talle i aire ostonna ar se-panyane i cordo telmasse.
He said to him: “If you are God's son, throw yourself down, for is written: He will command his angels concerning you, and they will carry you on their hands, to stop your foot from striking against stone.”	Quentes senna: “Qui elye Eruo yondo ná, hata inse undu, an ná técina: Canuvas valaryain pa lye, ar coluvaltel máltatse, pustien talelya petiello sarnenna!”
Jesus said: “Again is written: Do not test the Lord your God!”	Eque Yésus: “Ata ná técina: Áva tyasta i Heru Ainolya!”
Again the Devil brought him to an extremely high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of earth and their glory.	Ata i Arauco se-talle ita tára orontenna, ar tanne sen ilye i aranier cemeno ar alcarelta.
And he said to him: “All these things I will give to you if you fall down and you worship me.”	Ar quentes senna: “Ilye nati sine antauvan elyen qui lantal undu ar tyeril ni!”
Then Jesus said to him: “Begone, Satan! For is written: The Lord your God you are to worship, and he alone you are to serve.”	Tá Yésus quente senna: “Heca, Sátan! An ná técina: I Heru Ainolya alye tyera, ar sé erinqua alye veuya!”
Then the Devil went away from him, and behold! angels came and served him.	Tá i Arauco oante sello, ar yé! valali túler ar veuyaner se.
After hearing that John was put in prison, he went off into Galilee.	Apa hlarie i Yoháno náne panyana mandosse, lendes oa mir Alílea.
He went away from Nazareth and came and dwelt in Capernaum beside sea, in Zebulon's and Naphtali's regions,	Oantes Násaretello ar túle ar marne Capernaumesse ara ear, Sevulondo ar Naftalio ménassen,
to make true which was said through Isaiah the Prophet when he said:	carien anwa ya náne quétina ter Yesaia i Erutercáno íre quentes:
“O land of Zebulon and Naphtali, the sea-road beyond Jordan, Galilee of the nations!	“A nóre Sevulondo ar Naftalio, i earmalle Yordan pella, Alílea i nórion!
The people sitting in darkness saw a great light, and to who sat in the region of death-shadow, light arose.”	I lie hámala morniesse cenne hoa cala, ar in hamner ñuruhuineo ménasse cala oronte!”
From that time he made his message known and said: “Find repentance, for the kingdom of heaven has come near!”	Lúme yanallo carnes mentarya sinwa ar quente: “Hira inwis, an menelo aranie utúlie hare!”
Walking by the Sea of Galilee he saw two brothers, Simon who is called Peter and Andrew his brother, throwing a net into the sea, for they were fishers.	Vantala ara Ear Alíleo cennes háno atta, Símon ye ná estaina Péter ar Andréas hánorya, hátala rembe mir i ear, an anette raitoli.
And he said to them: “Come, follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.”	Ar quentes túna: “Tula, áni hilya, ar caruvan let raitoli atanion!”
In the same moment they left their net and followed him.	Mí imya lú hehtanette rembetta ar se-hilyanet.
Going from there he saw also two others who were brothers, James son of Zebedee and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, repairing their nets – and he called them.	Lelyala talo cennes yú exe atta yet nánet hánor, Yácov Severaion ar Yohannes hánorya, i luntesse as Severai ataretta, envinyatála rembettar – ar yaldeset.
In the same moment they abandoned the boat and their father, and followed him.	Mi imya lú hehtanette i lunte ar ataretta, ar hilyanettes.
And he went through all of Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and making known the gospel about the kingdom and healing every illness and every sickness among the people.	Ar lendes ter quanda Alílea, peantala yomencoaltassen ar carila sinwa i evandilyon pa i aranie ar nestala ilya hlíve ar ilya quáme imíca i lie.
And the story about him went into all of Syria, and they brought to him all ill ones, tormented by illnesses and by torments of many kinds: demon-possessed ones and moon-sick ones and impeded ones – and he healed them.	Ar i nyarie pa se lende mir quanda Síria, ar tulunelte senna ilye engwar, nwalyaine hlívelínen ar nwalmelínen rimbe nostaleron: raucoharyainali ar ránahlaiwali ar taptali – ar nestanes te.
And great crowds followed him, from Galile and the Ten Cities and Jerusalem and Judea, and from the country beyond the Jordan.	Ar hoe şangar se-hilyaner, ho Alílea ar i Ostor Quean ar Yerúsalem ar Yúrea, ar i nóriello Yordan pella.
Seeing the crowds he went up into the mountain, and when he sat down his disciples came to him.	Cénala i şangar lendes ama mir i oron, ar íre hamunes hildoryar túler senna.
And he opened his mouth and instructed them, saying:	Ar pantanes antorya ar peantane tien, quétala:
“Happy are the lacking ones in spirit, for they will possess the kingdom of heaven!	“Valime nar i penyar fairesse, an té haryuvar menelo aranie!
Happy are the ones that have grief, for they shall be comforted!	Valime nar i samir naire, an té nauvar tiutane!
Happy are the gentle ones, for they shall be heirs of earth!	Valime nar i moicar, an té nauvar aryoni cemeno!
Happy are the ones hungry and thirsty for righteousness, for they shall be filled!	Valime nar i maitar ar soicar failien, an té nauvar quátine!
Happy are the ones that give mercy, for they will receive mercy!	Valime nar i antar oravie, an té camuvar oravie!
Happy are the pure of heart, for they shall see God!	Valime nar i poicar endo, an té cenuvar Eru!
Happy are the ones that make peace, or they will be called God's sons!	Valime nar i carir raine, an té nauvar estaine Eruo yondor!
Happy are the ones persecuted because of righteousness, for the kingdom of heaven is for them!	Valime nar i roitainar failiénen, an tien menelo aranie ná!
Happy are you when people abuse you and persecute you and lying say every evil about you, by reason of me.	Valime nalde íre queni le-naityar ar le-roitar ar húrala quetir ilya ulco pa le, castanyanen.
You be happy and leap for joy, for great is your reward in heaven.	Alde na valime ar capa alassenen, an hoa ná paityalelda menelde.
You are the salt of earth; but if the strength goes away from the salt, how will its salty taste come back? It is not more good for a single thing, but is thrown outside, where people will trample upon it.	Elde nar cemeno singe; mal qui i poldore auta i singello, manen singwa tyáverya nanwenuva? Uas ambe mára erya naten, mal ná hátina ettenna, yasse queni vattuvar sanna.
You are the world's light. A city upon a mountain is not possible to hide.	Elde nar i mardo cala. Osto orontesse ua cúvima.
One does not light a lamp and put it under a vessel, but on the lampstand, and it shines on everyone in the house.	Mo ua narta calma ar sa-panya nu calpa, mal i calmatarmasse, ar caltas ilquenna i coasse.
Thus you as well cause your light to shine upon men, for them to see your good deeds and for them to give glory to your Father, who is in heaven.	Sie yú elde tyara calalda calta atannar, polieltan cene máre cardaldar ar antaveltan alcar Atareldan, ye ea menelde.
Do not think that I have come to take away the Law or the Prophets. I have not come to take away, but to make real!	Áva sana in inye utúlie mapien oa i Şanye hya i Erutercánor. Uan utúlie mapien oa, mal carien nanwa!
For I say to you that heaven and earth will pass before a single smallest letter or a single mark will pass away from the Law, before everything has been made true.	An quetin lenna i menel cemenye autuvat nó erya ampitya tengwa hya erya tehta autuva i Şanyello, nó ilqua anaie carna nanwa.
Thus, everyone that breaks one among the smallest commandments and teaches men so, he will be called the smallest, in the kingdom of heaven. But everyone who follows it and instructs others about it, he shall he called great in the kingdom of heaven.	Sie, ilquen ye race er mici i ampitye axani ar peanta atanin sie, isse nauva estaina i ampitya, menelo araniesse. Mal ilquen ye hilya sa ar peanta exi pa sa, isse nauva estaina túra menelo araniesse.
For I say to you that of your righteousness is not greater than the righteousness of the scribes and the Pharisees, you will by no means come into the kingdom of heaven.	An quetin lenna i qui failielda ua túra epe i failie i parmangolmoron ar i Farisaron, laume tuluvalde mir menelo aranie.
You heard that was said to the old ones: Do not kill, but anyone that does kill will come under judgement!	Hlasselde i náne quétina i yárannar: Áva nahta; mal aiquen ye é nahta tuluva nu namie!
But I say to you that anyone who is angry with his brother will come under judgement, and anyone who says to his brother: 'Ráca' will be judged by the High Council, but anyone who says: 'Fool!' will be destined for Gehenna's fire!	Mal inye quete lenna in aiquen ye ná rúşea hánoryanna tuluva nu namie, ar ilquen ye quete hánoryanna: 'Ráca!' nauva námina lo i Tára Ocombe, mal aiquen ye quete 'Auco!' nauva martyana Ehenno náren!
If, then, you are coming to the altar bringing your gift, and there you recall that your brother has a quarrel with you,	Qui, tá, túlal i yangwanna tálala annalya, ar tasse enyalil i hánolya same costie aselye,
you are to leave your gift there before the altar, and go away: First make your peace with your brother, and then, when you have returned, you may bring your gift.	alye hehta annalya tasse epe i yangwa, ar mena oa: Minyave cara rainelya as hánolya, ar tá, íre enutúliel, lertal tala annalya.
Be quick to make peace with your enemy while you are still with him on the road – or the enemy will give you over to the judge, and the judge to the court attendant , and you will be thrown into prison.	Na linta carien raine as ñottolya lan en nalye óse i mallesse – hya i ñotto antauva lye olla i námon, ar i námo i námonduren, ar nalye hátina mir mando.
Truly I say to you: You will not come out from there before you have payed the last small piece of silver!	Násie quetin lyenna: Laume tulil et talo nó apaitielye i métima pitya mitta tyelpeva!
You have heard that it has been said: 'Do not break marriage!'	Ahlárielde i anaie quétina: 'Áva race vestale!'
But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman longing for her, has even then broken marriage with her in his heart.	Mal inye quete lenna in ilquen ye yéta nís milyala se, yando tá arácie vestale óse endaryasse.
If your right eye seduces you, tear it out and throw it away from you! For if one among your body parts is lost, that is for you better than that your entire body is thrown into Gehenna.	Qui forya hendelya le-sahta, ása narca ettenna ar ása hate oa lyello! An qui er mici hroamittalyar vanwa ná, ta ná len arya epe i quanda hroalya ná hátina mir Ehenna.
And if your right hand seduces you, cut it off and throw it away from you. For if one among your body-parts is lost, that is for you better than that your entire body comes into Gehenna.	Ar qui formalya lye-sahta, ása aucire ar ása hate lyello. An qui er mici hroamittalyar vanwa ná, ta ná len arya epe i quanda hroalya tule mir Ehenna.
It is said: It is necessary for the one who divorces his wife to give her a writing of divorce .	Ná quétaina: Mauya yen lehtaxe veriryallo sen-anta tecie aumentavéva.
But I say to you: Everyone who divorces his wife except by reason of fonication, causes her to break marriage. And who gets married to a woman who has been sent away, breaks marriage.	Mal inye quete lenna: Ilquen ye lehtaxe veriryallo hequa castanen úpuhtiéva, tyare se race vestale. Ar ye verya nissenna ye anaie mentana oa, race vestale.
Furthermore, you have heard that was said to the old ones: “Do not give a lying oath, but keep for the Lord the oaths that you have given.	Ente, ahlárielde i náne quétina i yárannar: Áva anta húrala vanda, mal hepa i Hérun i vandar yar ániel.
But I say to you: Do not give oaths at all, not by heaven , for it is the throne of God,	Mal inye quete lenna: Aqua áva anta vandar, lá menelden, an nas i mahalma Eruva,
or by earth, for it is the support for his feet, or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the mighty king.	hya cemennen, an nas i tulco talyant, hya Yerúsalemnen, an nas osto i taura aranwa.
Also do not give oaths by your head, for you cannot make a single hair white or black.	Yando áva anta vandar carelyanen, an ualye pole care erya finde ninque hya morna.
Your speech will be yes, yes – no, no! which is beyond this, is of evil.	Quetielya nauva ná, ná – lá, lá! Ya ná han si, ulcuo ná.
You have heard that has been said: “An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth!	Ahlárielde i anaie quétina: Hen henden, ar nelet nelcen!
But I say to you: Do not stand against that does evil to you. If anyone strikes you on your right chin, turn also the other one towards him.	Mal inye quete lenna: Áva tare yenna care ulco lenna. Qui aiquen le-pete forya ventalyasse, quera yú i exe senna.
If anyone wants to go to a judge with you to take your tunic, allow him to take also your cloak.	Qui aiquen mere lelya námonna aselye mapien laupelya, ásen lave mapa yando collalya.
And if anyone compels you to follow him one mile, go with him two miles.	Ar qui aiquen mauya lye hilya se larnelta er, á lelya óse larnelta atta.
Give to who asks of you, and do not turn from who wants to use anything that you have.	Á anta yen arca lyello, ar áva quere imle yello mere yuhta aiqua ya samil.
You have heard that is said: Love your neighbor and hate your enemy!	Ahlárielde i ná quétaina: Mela armarolya ar teva ñottolya!
But I say to you: Love your enemies, bless the ones that curse you, do well to those that hate you, and pray for those that pursue you,	Mal inye quete lenna: Mela ñottolyar, á aista i hútar le, cara mai in le-tevir, ar hyama in le-roitar,
for you to be children of your Father in heaven. For he causes his sun to rise over wicked ones and good ones, and lets rain fall upon just ones and unjust ones.	náveldan híni Atareldo menelde. An isse tyare Anarya orta or ulcar ar mani, ar lave ulo lanta failannar ar úfailannar.
If you love who love you, what is your reward? Do not the tax collectors do the same thing?	Qui melilde i melir le, mana paityalelya? Ma i tungwemor uar care i imya nat?
And if you greet only your brothers, how is this a great thing? Do not people of the nations do the same?	Ar qui suilal rie hánolyar, manen si ná túra nat? Ma queni i nórion uar care i imya?
Be, then, perfect, as your Father in heaven is perfect.	Na, tá, ilvane, tambe Atarelda menelde ilvana ná.
Take heed that you do not do your righteousness in front of men to be watched by them, or you will not have reward from your Father in heaven.	Cima i ualde care failielda epe atani náven tíraine lo té, hya ualde samuva paityale Atareldallo menelde.
Therefore, when you give gifts of mercy, do not sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the roads, to receive glory from them. Truly I say to you: They are receiving their whole reward.	Etta, íre antal annar óraviéva, áva lamya róma epe lye, ve i imnetyandor carir i yomencoassen ar i mallessen, camien alcar ho té. Násie quetin lenna: Cámalte quanda paityalelta.
But you, when you give gifts of mercy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing;	Mal elye, íre antal annar óraviéva, áva lave hyarmalyan ista ya formalya cára;
thus your gifts of mercy will be in secret; then your father, who is watching in secret, will reward you.	sie annalyar óraviéva nauvar nuldasse; tá Atarelya, ye tíra nuldasse, paityuva lyen.
Therefore, when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray when they are standing on the corners of the roads, in order to be visible to men.	Ente, íre hyamilde, áva na ve i imnatyandor, an melilte hyame íre táralte i malleron vincassen, náven cénime atanin.
Truly I tell you: They are receiving their entire reward.	Násie quetin lenna: Cámalte quanda paityalelta.
But you , when you pray, go into your own room, and after closing your door, pray to your Father who is in secret; then your Father who is secretly watching, will pay you.	Mal elye, ire hyamil, mena mir véra şambelya, ar apa holtie fennalya, hyama Atarelyanna ye ea nuldasse; tá Atarelya ye nuldave tíra, paityuva lyen.
But when you are praying, do not say the same things in monotonous repetition, as people of the nations do, for they think that they will be being heard by using numerous words.	Mal íre hyámal, áva quete i imye nati mi vorongandale, ve queni i nórion carir, an sanalte i nauvalte hláraine yuhtiénen rimbe quettali.
Therefore, do not be like them, for God your Father know your needs before you request from him.	Etta, áva na ve té, an Eru Atarelda ista maureldar nó arcalde senna.
Pray, then, thus: Our Father in heaven, holy be your name!	Hyama, tá, sie: Átarelma menelde, na aire esselya!
Let your kingdom come! Let your will be done on earth as in heaven!	Aranielya na tuluva! Na care indómelya cemende tambe menelde!
Give us today our daily bread,	Ámen anta síra ilaurea massalma,
and forgive us our sins as we forgive them to them that sin against us.	ar ámen apsene úcarelvar síve elme apsenir tai tien i úcarir elmen.
Do not lead us into temptation but deliver us from evil! Amen!	Álame tulya úsahtienna mal áme etelehta ulcullo! Násie!
If you forgive men their crimes, your Father in heaven will also forgive you;	Qui apsenilde atanin ongweltar, yú apsenuva len Atarelda menelde;
but if you do not forgive men, your Father will in the same manner not forgive your crimes to you.	mal qui ualde apsene atanin, Atarelda mi imya lé ua apsenuva ongweldar len.
When you keep a fast, do not be like the hypocrites, who make their face disfigured in order to make their fast visible to men. Truly I say to you: They are receiving their entire reward.	Íre helpilde lamate, áva na ve imnatyandor, i carir cendelelta úvanima carien lamatelta cénima atanin. Násie quetin lenna: Cámalte quanda paityalelta.
But you , when you keep a fast, put oil on your head and wash your face.	Mal elye, íre hepilde lamate, á panya millo carelyasse ar sova cendelelya.
Thus your fasting will not be visible to men, but to your Father who is in secret; and your Father, who secretly is watching, will pay you.	Sie lamatelta ua nauva cénima atanin, mal Atarelyan ye ea nuldasse; ar Atarelya, ye nuldave tíra, paityuva len.
Do not gather for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and erosion devour, and where thieves break in and steal.	Áva comya len harmar cemende, yasse malo ar ñwarie ammatir, ar yasse arpor racir minna ar pilir.
But gather for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moth and erosion do not devour, and where thieves do not break in and steal.	Mal á comya len harmar menelde, yasse malo ar ñwarie uar ammate, ar yasse arpor uar race minna ar pilir.
For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.	An yasse harmalya ea, tasse yú endalya euva.
Your body's lamp is the eye. Therefore, if your eye is in health, your entire body will be bright,	Hroalyo calma ná i hen. Etta, qui hendelya ná málesse, quanda hroalya nauva calima,
but if your eye is wicked, your entire body will be dark. If the light that is in you is darkness, how great the darkness is!	mal qui hendelya ná olca, quanda hroalya nauva morna. Qui i cala ya ea lyesse ná mornie, manen hoa i mornie ná!
Nobody can be a slave for two lords; he will hate the one and love the other, or he will stick to the one and loathe the other. You cannot be slaves for God and for Mammon alike.	Úquen pole náve mól heru attan; tevuvas i mine ar meluva i exe, hya himyuvas i mine ar yeltuva i exe. Ualde pole náve móli Erun ar Mammonden véla.
Therefore I say to you: Do not be troubled about yourselves, about what you will eat or what you will drink, or about your bodies, concerning the clothers you will wear. Is the life not more than food and the body than the clothes?	Etta quetin lenna: Áva na tarastaine pa inde, pa mana matuvalde hya mana sucuvalde, hya pa hroalya, pa i lanni yar coluvalde. Ma i cuile ua amba epe matta ar i hroa epe i larmar?
Notice the birds of heaven, that they do not sow or reap or gather into barns , and yet your heavenly Father gives them food. Are you not more important than them?	Cima menelo aiwi, i ualte rere hya cirihta hya comya mir haurar, ananta meneldea Atarelda anta tien matta. Ma ualde valdie epe té?
Who among you can add a single cubit to his life?	Man imíca le pole napane erya perranga coivieryan?
Furthermore, concerning clothes, what is your reason for being troubled? Learn from the lilies of the field, how they do not labour and do not twine ,	Ente, pa lanni, mana castalda náven tarastaine? Para i resto indilinen, manen ualte mole ar ualte lia,
but I tell you that Solomon in his glory was not clad as a single among them.	mal nyarin len i Solomon alcareryasse úne tópina ve erya mici té.
If God so adorns the plants in the field, that exist today and will be gone tomorrow, how much more richly will he cover you, you of little faith?	Qui Eru sie netya i olvar i restasse, i ear sisse síra ar nauvar vanwe enwa, manen ita ambe lárave topuvas lé, elde pitya saviéno?
Therefore, do not be troubled and say: “What will we eat?” or “With what are we to cover ourselves?”	Etta áva na tarastaine ar quete: “Mana matuvalve?” hya “Mananen topuvalve inwe?”
For all these things the nations pursue. But your heavenly Father knows that you have need of all these things.	An ilye nati sine i nóri roitar. Mal meneldea Atarelda ista i samilde maure ilye sine nativa.
Seek first the kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.	Á cesta minyave i aranie ar failierya, ar ilye sine nati nauvar napánine len.
Therefore, do not be troubled about the following day, for the following day will have its own troubles. Every day's evil suffices for it.	Etta, áva na tarastaine pa i hilyala aure, an i hilyala aure samuva vére tarastieryar. Ilya réo ulco farya san.
Do not judge, so as not to be judged,	Áva name, lá náven námine,
for by the judgment with which you are judging you will be judged, and by the measure with which you measure out, will be measured out to you.	an i námiénen yanen námal nauval námina, ar i lestanen yanen etelestal nauva etelestana lyen.
Then how is that you look at the sedge in your brother's eye, but does not heed the rafter in your own eye?	Tá manen ná i yétal i lisce hanolyo hendesse, mal ua cime i pano véra hendelyasse?
Or how is it possible for you to say to your brother: 'Allow me to pull the sedge out of your eye', when behold! there is a rafter in your own eye?	Hya manen ece lyen quete hánolyanna: 'Lava nin tuce i lisce et hendetyallo', íre yé! ea pano véra hendelyasse?
Hypocrite! First pull he rafter out from your own eye, and then you can see how to pull the sedge out of your brother's eye.	Imnetyando! Minyave tuca i pano et véra hendelyallo, ar tá polil cene manen tuce i lisce et hánolyo hendello.
Do not give what is holy to the dogs; in the same manner, do not throw your pearls before swine, or they will trample them under their feet and will turn themselves and tear you .	Áva anta ya aire ná i huoin; mi imya lé, áva hate marillaldar epe polcar, hya vattuvaltet nu talultar ar queruvar inte ar narcuvar le.
Ask, and will be given you; seek, and you shall find, knock, and will be opened to you.	Á arca, ar nauva len antana; á cesta, ar hiruvalde, á tamba, ar nauva len latyana.
For everyone asking receives, and everyone seeking finds, and to everyone knocking will be opened.	An ilquen arcala came, ar ilquen cestala hire, ar ilquenen tambala nauva latyana.
Who among you, if his son asks for a bread, will give him a stone?	Man imíca le, qui yondorya arca massa, antauva sen sar?
Or if he asks for a fish – surely he will not give him a snake?	Hya qui arcas lingwe – lau antauvas sen leuca?
Therefore, if you that are wicked know to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those that ask of him?	Etta, qui elde i nar olce istar anta máre annar hínaldain, manen ita ambe Atarelda ye ea menelde antauva máre nati in arcar sello?
Therefore, all things that you want done to you by men, do them in the same manner. That is what the Law and the Prophets mean.	Etta, ilye nati yar merilde cárine len lo atani, cara tien mí imya lé. Ta ná ya tear i Şanye ar i Erutercánor.
Go inside through the narrow gate, for broad and wide is the road that leads away to destruction, and numerous are the ones that go inside through it,	Mena minna ter i náha ando, an palla ar yanda ná i malle ya tulya oa nancarienna, ar rimbe nar i menir minna ter sa,
but narrow is the gate and narrow is the road leading into life, and few are that find it.	mal náha ná i ando ar lenwa i malle tulyala mir coivie, ar mance nar i hirir sa.
Watch yourselves concerning the false prophets that come to you in sheep's clothing, but on the inside they are devouring wolves.	Tira inde pa i hurutercánor i tulir lenna mámaron lannessen, mal mityasse nalte ammátala ñarmor.
By their fruits you will know them. People do not gather grapes from thorns or figs from thistles, no?	Yáveltainen istuvaldet. Queni uar comya tiumar necelillon hya relyávi nastalaimallon, lá?
Thus every good tree bears good fruit, but every rotten tree produces foul fruit.	Sie ilya mára alda cole mára yáve, mal ilya quelexima alda care şaura yáve.
A good tree cannot bear worthless fruit; in the same manner, a rotten tree cannot bear good fruit.	Mára alda ua pole cole úmirwa yáve; mi imya lé, quelexima alda ua pole cole mára yáve.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.	Ilya alda ya ua cole mára yáve ná círina undu ar hátina mir i náre.
Indeed by their fruit you will know them!	É yáveltainen istuvaldet!
Not everyone who says to me: Lord, Lord, will come into the kingdom of heaven, but who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.	Lá ilquen ye quete ninna: Heru, Heru, tuluva mir menelo aranie, mal ye care i indóme Atarinyo ye ea menelde.
Numerous ones will say to me in that day: 'Lord, Lord, did we not speak as prophets in your name, and throw out demons in your name, and do many mighty deeds in your name?'	Rimbali quetuvar nin enta auresse: 'Heru, Heru, ma ualme quente ve Erutercánor esselyanen, ar et-hanter raucor esselyanen, ar carner rimbe taurie cardali esselyanen?'
But then I will tell them: 'I did not ever know you! Away from me, you who break the law!'	Mal tá nyaruvan tien: 'Uan oi sinte le! Oa nillo, elde i racir i şánye!”
Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine will be like an intelligent man, who built his house on the rock.	Etta ilquen ye hlare sine quettanyar nauva ve handa nér, ye carastane coarya i ondosse.
And the rain poured down, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, but it did not fall, for it was founded on the rock.	Ar i ulo ulle undu, ar i oloiri túler, ar i súri vávaner ar penter coa tananna, mal uas lantane, an anes tulcana i ondosse.
Furthermore, everyone that hears these words of mine and does not do according to them is like an unintelligent man, who built his house on the sand.	Ente, ilquen ye hlare sine quettanyar ar uar care ve tai ná ve úhanda nér, ye carastane coarya i litsesse.
And the rain poured down, and the floods came, and the winds blew and struck against that house, and it collapsed, and its fall was great!”	Ar i ulo ulle undu, ar i oloiri túler, ar i súri vávaner ar penter coa tananna, ar talantes, ar lantarya náne hoa!”
Now when Jesus finished all these words, the crowds were in wonder at his teaching,	Sí íre Yésus telyane ilye quettar sine, i şángar náner elmendasse peantieryanen,
for he taught them as a person having authority, and not like their scribes.	an peantanes ve quén arwa túreo, ar lá ve parmangolmoltar.
And after he came down from the mountain huge throngs followed him.	Ar apa túles undu i orontello hoe şangar hilyaner se.
And look, a leprous person cane to him and fell down before him, saying: “Lord, if you wish, you can cleanse me!”	Ar yé, halmahlaiwa quén túle senna ar lantane undu epe se, quétala: “Heru, qui meril, polil poita ni!”
And reaching out with his hand he touched him, saying: “I want to! Be clean!” And in the same moment he was cleansed from his leprosy .	Ar rahtala máryanen se-appanes, quétala: “Merin! Na poica!” Ar mi imya lú anes poitana halmahlíveryallo.
And Jesus said to him: “See that you say nothing to anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest, and sacrifice the gift that Moses commanded, as a witness to them!”	Ar Yésus quente senna: “Cena i quetil munta aiquenna, mal mena, á tana imle i airimon, ar yaca i anna ya Móses canne, ve vettie tien!”
And when he went into Capernaum, a centurion came to him, petitioning of him	Ar íre lendes mir Capernaum, tuxantur túle senna, arcala senna
and saying: “Lord, my servant lies lame in the house, having terrible pains!”	ar quétala: “Heru, núronya caita lalevíte i coasse, arwa rúcime ñwalmaron!”
And he said to him: “When I come, I shall heal him!”	Ar quentes senna: “Íre tulin, nestuvanyes!”
But the centurion answered him: “Lord, I am not worthy that you come under my roof, but if you solely say the word, my servant will be healed.	Mal i tuxantur hanquente sie: “Heru, uan valda i tulil nu tópanya, mal qui rie quetil i quetta, núronya nauva nestana.
For I as well am a man put under authority, having soldiers under me, and if I say to this person: Go!, then he is going, and to another: Come!, then he is coming, and to my servant: Do this!, then he does it!”	An yú inye ná nér panyana nu túre, arwa ohtarion nu ni, ar qui quetin quén sinanna: Mena!, tá ménas, ar exenna: Tula!, tá túlas, ar núronyanna: Cara si!, tá carises!”
Hearing that, Jesus was filled with wonder and said to that followed him: “I truly say to you, such faith I have not found in anyone in Israel.	Hlárala ta, Yésus náne quátina elmendanen ar quente innar hilyaner se: “Násie quetin lenna, taite savie uan ihírie aiquende Israelde.
But I say to you that numerous ones will come from East and West and will lie at the table with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven,	Mal quetin lenna i tuluvar rimbali Rómello ar Númello ar caituvar ara i sarno as Avraham ar Ísac ar Yácov menelo araniesse,
while the sons of the kingdom will be thrown into the darkness on the outside. There will be their waiting and their grinding of teeth!	lan i araniéno yondor nauvar hátine mir i mornie i ettesse. Tasse euvar yaiwelta ar mulielta nelciva!”
Then Jesus said to the centurion: “Go! As you have believed, so let it happen for you!” And the servant was healed in that hour.	Tá Yésus quente i tuxanturenna: “Mena! Síve asáviel, tambe á marta lyen!” Ar i núro náne nestana yana lúmesse.
And Jesus, when he came into Peter's house, saw his wife's mother bedridden and sick with a fever.	Ar Yésus, íre túles mir coarya Péter, cenne veriryo amil caimassea ar hlaiwa úrenen.
And Jesus touched her hand, and the fever vanished from her. And she arose and ministered to him.	Ar Yésus appane márya, ar i úre váne hello. Ar hé oronte ar veuyane sen.
But after evening came, people brought to him many that were possessed by demons, and he threw out the demons with a word, and he healed all that were suffering,	Mal apa şinye túle, queni taller senna rimbali i náner haryane lo raucor, ar et-hantes i raucor quettanen, ar nestanes illi i perpéraner,
making true what was written through Isaiah the Prophet, saying: “He took our illnesses and bore our sicknesses!”	carien nanwa ya náne quétina ter Yesaia i Erutercáno, quétala: “Sé nampe hlívelvar ar colde quámelvar!”
When Jesus saw a throng that surrounded him, he commanded that they were to go to the other shore.	Íre Yésus cenne şanga ya pelde se, cannes i lelyumnelte i hyana fáranna.
And a scribe came to him and said to him: “Teacher, I will follow you to every place that you go!”	Ar parmangolmo túle senna ar quente senna: “Peantar, hilyuvan lye ilya nómenna yanna lelyal!”
But Jesus said to him: “Foxes have holes and the birds of heaven have nests, but the Son of Man does not have a place where he may put his head!”	Mal Yésus quente senna: “Rusqui samir eccar ar menelo aiwi samir haustar, mal i Atanyondo ua same nóme yasse lertas panya carya!”
Then another among his disciples sayd to him: “Lord, let me first go away and bring my father to his grave!”	Tá exe mici hildoryar quente senna: “Heru, lava nin minyave auta ar tala atarinya sapsaryanna!”
Jesus said to him: “Follow me, and let the dead bring their dead ones to their graves!”	Yésus quente senna: “Áni hilya, ar lava i qualinain tala qualinaltar sapsaltannar!”
And when he went into a boat, his disciples followed him.	Ar íre lendes mir lunte, hildoryar hilyaner se.
And look, there was an uprising in the sea, covering the boat with the waves, but he was asleep.	Ar yé, enge túra amortale i earesse, túpala i lunte i falmainen, mal isse náne lorna.
And they came and woke him up, saying: “Lord, save us, we are dying!”	Ar túlelte ar eccoitaner se, quétala: “Heru, áme rehta, quálalme!”
But he said to them: “How is that you are timid, people of little faith?” Then, standing up, he rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a deep silence.	Mal quentes téna: “Manen ná i nalde caurie, queni pitya saviéno?” Tá, ortala, naityanes i súri ar i ear, ar enge núra quilde.
But the men were filled with wonder and said: “Of what kind is this man, since also the winds and the sea do as he says?”	Mal i neri náner quátine elmendanen ar quenter: “Mana nostaleo ná nér sina, pan yú i súri ar i ear carir ve quetis?”
When he came to the other shore, into the land of the Gadarenes, two men possessed by demons met him, coming from the graves, extremely fierce. Therefore nobody had the courage to choose that road.	Íre túles i hyana fáranna, mir i nóre i Araryaron, nér atta haryaine lo raucoli vellet se, túlala et i noirillon, ita verce. Etta úquen sáme i huore cilien tana malle.
And behold! they cried , saying: “What is to us and to you, Son of God? Have you come hither to torment us before the time?”	Ar yé! yámette, quétala: “Mana ment ar lyen, Eruion? Ma utúliel sir nwalien met nó i lúme?”
But far from them was a herd of many pigs on pasture.	Mal haira tello enge lámáre rimbe polcalíva nesselesse.
The demons asked of him, saying: “If you throw us out, send us into the herd of pigs!”	I raucor arcaner senna, quétala: “Qui et-hatil me, áme menta mir i lámáre polcaiva!”
And he said to them: “Go!” And after coming out they went into the pigs, and behold! the entire herd wend rushing over the precipice into the sea, and they died in the waters.	Ar quentes téna: “Mena!” Ar apa ettulie lendelte mir i poicar, ar yé! i quanda lámáre lende rimpa olla i lanca mir i ear, ar quallelte i nenissen.
But the shepherds fled, and going into the city they told everything, also concerning the demon-possessed ones.	Mal i mavari úşer, ar lelyala mir i osto nyarnelte ilqua, yú pa i raucoharyanar.
And behold! the entire city went out to meet Jesus, and after seeing him, they urged him to go away from their regions.	Ar yé! i quanda osto etelende velien Yésus, ar apa cenie se, hortaneltes auta ménaltallon.
And going into the boat he crossed the sea and went into his own city.	Ar lelyala mir i lunte lahtanes i ear ar lende mir véra ostorya.
And behold, they brought to him a lame man lying on a bed. Seeing their faith Jesus said to the lame one: “Courage, child! Your sins are forgiven!”	Ar yé, tallelte senna lalevíte nér caitala caimasse. Cénala savielta Yésus quente i lalevítenna: “Huore, hína! Úcaretyar nar apsénine!”
And behold, some among the scribes said to themselves: “This man is blaspheming!”	Ar yé, queneli mici i parmangolmor quenter intenna: “Nér sina naiquéta!”
And Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said: “How is that you are thinking wicked things in your heart?	Ar Yésus, istala sanweltar, quente: “Manen ná i sánealde olce natali endaldasse?
For what is the more easy thing to say: Your sins are forgiven, or: Rise and walk – ? But for you to know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins – ” then he said to the lame one: “Rise, take your bed and go to your home!”	An mana i ambe ancárima nat quetien: Úcaretyar nar apsénine, hya: Á orta ar vanta – ? Mal istieldan in i Atanyondo same túre cemende apsenien úcari –” tá quentes i lalevítenna: “Á orta, á mapa caimalya ar mena marelyanna!”
And he arose and went to his home.	Ar orontes ar lende maryanna.
Seeing that, the crowds were terrified and gave glory to God, who gave such power to men.	Cénala ta, i şangar náner ruhtaine ar antaner alcar Erun, ye antane taite túre atanin.
And going away from there Jesus saw a man sit at the tax office, called Matthew, and he said to him: “Follow me!” And he arose and followed him.	Ar autala talo Yésus cenne nér hára i tungwemende, estaina Mattéo, ar quentes senna: “Áni hilya!” Ar orontes ar hilyane se.
Thereafter, when he lay by the table in the house, behold! many tax collectors and sinners came and lay there with Jesus and his disciples.	Epeta, íre caines ara i sarno i coasse, yé! rimbe tungwemóli ar úcarindoli túler ar cainer tasse as Yésus ar hildoryar.
But seeing that, the Pharisees were saying to his disciples: “How is that your teacher eats with the tax collectors and sinners?	Mal cénala ta, i Farisar quétaner hildoryannar: “Manen ná i peantarelda mate as tungwemóli ar úcarindoli?”
Hearing it he said: “People in health do not have need of a healer, but the ailing ones .	Hlárala sa quentes: “Queni málesse uar same maure aşarova, mal i nimpar.
Go and learn what this means: I want mercy and not sacrifice. For I came to call, not righteous ones, but sinners!”	Mena ar para ya si tea: Merin óravie ar lá yacie. An túlen yalien, lá failar, mal úcarindor!”
Then John the Baptist's disciples came to him and asked: “How is that we and the Pharisees keep fasts, but your disciples do not keep fasts?”	Tá Yoháno i Sumbando hildor túler senna ar maquenter: “Manen ná i elme ar i Farisar hepir lamati, mal hildolyar uar hepe lamati?”
And Jesus said to them: “The friends of the bridegroom surely cannot have grief while the bridegroom is with them? But days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will keep fasts.	Ar Yésus quente téna: “I endero meldor lau polir same naire íre i ender ea aselte? Mal rí tuluvar íre i ender nauva mapana oa tello, ar tá hepuvalte lamati.
No one fastens a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old cloak, for its full power will pull from it, and there will be a worse tearing.	Úquen tace lilma alapihta lanneo yára collasse, an quanta túrerya tucuva sallo, ar euva ambe faica narcie.
Furthermore, no one puts new wine in old skin-bottles, but if one does do so, the skin-bottles are ruptured and the wine pours out and the skin-bottles are destroyed. But people put new wine in new skin-bottles, and both remain!”	Ente, úquen panya vinya limpe yáre helmolpessen, mal qui mo é care sie, i helmolpi nar rúvine ar i limpe ulya ettenna ar i helmolpi nar nancarne. Mal queni panyar vinya limpe vinye helmolpessen, ar yúyo lemyat!”
While he told them these things, behold! a ruler came near and bowed to him, saying: “My daughter died a little while ago, but come and put your hand on her, and she will return to life!”	Íre nyarnes téna nati sine, yé! tur túle hare ar luhtane senna, quétala: “Selyenya şintanéya qualle, mal tula ar á panya málya sesse, ar nanwenuvas coivienna!”
Then Jesus arose and followed him, with his disciples.	Tá Yésus oronte ar se-hilyane, as hildoryar.
And behold! a woman having a flood of blood for twelve years came behind him and touched the rim of his cloak,	Ar yé! nís arwa celumeo serceva ter loar yunque túle ca se ar appane collaryo lane,
for she said to herself: “If only I touch his cloak I shall be saved!”	an quentes insenna: “Qui eryave appan collarya nauvan rehtana!”
Jesus turned and, noticing her, said: “Courage, daughter! Your faith has saved you!” And from that time the woman had health.	Yésus quernexe ar, tuntala se, quente: “Huore, selye! Savielya erehtie lye!” Ar yana lúmello i nís sáme mále.
When he came to the house of the ruler and saw the flute-players and the crowd making clamour,	Íre túles coanna i turwa ar cenne i simpetari ar i şanga cárala yalme,
Jesus said: “Go away from here, for the maiden did not die, but she is asleep. Then they laughed at him with scorn.	Yésus quente: “Á auta silo, an i vende ua qualle, mal náse lorna!” Tá lalanelte senna yaiwenen.
After sending the crowd outside he went inside and took her hand, and the maiden arose.	Apa mentave i şanga ettenna lendes minna ar nampe márya, ar i vende oronte.
And this story went out to that entire region.	Ar nyarna sina ettúle quanda sana ménanna.
When Jesus passed along from there, two blind men followed him, crying and saying: “Have mercy on us, Son of David!”	Íre Yésus lahtane talo, laceníte nér atta hilyanet se, yámala ar quétala: “Órava metse, Lavirion!”
After going into the house, the sightless ones came to him, and Jesus said to them: “Do you believe that I can do this?” They answered him: “Yes, Lord!”	Apa menie mir i coa, i laceníti túler senna, ar Yésus quente senna. “Ma saviste i polin care si?” Hanquentette senna: “Ná, Heru!”
Then he touched their eyes, saying: “May it happen to you as you believe!”	Tá appanes henduttat, quétala: “Nai martuva lent ve saviste!”
And their eyes received sight. Furthermore, Jesus firmly commanded them, saying: “See that no one knows it!”	Ar henduttat camnet céne. Ente, Yésus tulcave canne tun, quétala: “Cena in úquen ista sa!”
But they, when they went outside, told about him to in that entire region.	Mal tú, íre lendette ettenna, nyarne pa se mi quanda sana ména.
Now, when he went away, behold! people brought him a dumb man possessed by a demon,	Sí íre oantelte, yé! queni taller senna úpa nér haryaina lo rauco,
and after the demon was thrown out, the dumb man spoke. The crowds were filled with wonder and said: “A thing like this has not ever been seen in Israel!”	ar apa i rauco náne et-hátina, i úpa nér carampe. I şangar náner quátine elmendanen ar quenter: “Nat ve si ua oi anaie cénina Israelde!”
But the Pharisees said: “By the lord of the demons he throws out the demons!”	Mal i Farisar quenter: “I raucoron herunen et-hatis i raucor!”
And Jesus went in a circuit to all the cities and villages, instructing in their synagogues and making known the gospel of the kingdom and healing every kind of sickness and every kind of ailment.	Ar Yésus lende rindesse ilye i ostonnar ar mastonnar, peantala yomencoaltassen ar cárala sinwa i evandilyon i araniéno ar nestala ilya nostale hlíveo ar ilya nostale nimpiéno.
When he saw the crowds, his heart went out to them, for they were naked and scattered like sheep without a shepherd.	Íre cennes i şangar, endarya etelende téna, an anelte helde ar vintane ve mámar ú mavaro.
Then he said to his disciples: “The harvest is great, but who work are few. Therefore ask of the Lord of the harvest that he will send workers to his harvest!”	Tá quentes hildoryannar: “I yávie hoa ná, mal i molir nar mance. Etta arca i yaviéno Herunna i mentauvas molindor yávieryanna!”
And he summoned the twelve disciples and gave to them power over unclean spirits, for them to throw them out, and for them to heal every disease and every ailing condition.	Ar tultanes i hildor yunque ar antane tien túre or úpoice fairi, et-hatieltan te, ar nestieltan ilya hlíve ar ilya nimpa sóma.
 names of the twelve disciples are these: First Simon who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, and Jacob the son of Zebedee, and John his brother,	Essi i hildoron yunque nar sine: Minyave Símon ye ná estaina Péter, ar Andréas hánorya, ar Yácov yondorya Severai, ar Yohannes hánorya,
Philip and Bartholomew, Thomas and Matthew the tax collector, Jacob the brother of Alpheus and Thaddeus,	Filip ar Varşoloméo, Tomas ar Mattéo i tungwemo, Yácov yondorya Alféo ar Şandéo,
Simon the Cananean and Judas Iscariot, who after gave him over.	Símon i Canáanya ar Yúras Iscariot, ye apa antane se olla.
These twelve Jesus sent forth, giving them these commands: “Do not go on the road to the nations, and do not come into a Samaritan city.	Yunque sine Yésus etementane, antala tien canwar sine: “Áva mene i mallesse i nórennar, ar áva tule mir Samárea osto.
Instead go to the lost sheep from the house of Israel!	I mende mena i vanwe mámannar Israélo coallo!
While you go, make known the message, saying: 'The kingdom of heaven has come near.'	Lan lelyalde, á cara sinwa i menta, quétala: 'Menelo aranie utúlie hare.'
Heal sick ones, raise dead ones, cleanse skin-diseased ones, throw out demons! You have received for nothing, give for nothing!	Á nesta hlaiwar, á orta qualinar, á poita halmahlaiwar, et-hata raucor! Acámielde muntan, á anta muntan!
Do not put gold or silver or copper in your belt	Áva panya malta hya telpe hya urus quiltaldasse
or bring a food-pouch for the journey, or two tunics, or shoes or a staff, for who works is worthy of his food.	hya tala mattapoco i lendan, hya laupe atta, hya hyapat hya vandil, an ye mole ná valda mattaryo.
In every city or village into which you come, find out who in it is worthy, and remain there until you go away.	Ilya ostosse hya mastosse mir ya tulilde, ceşa man sasse valda ná, ar á lemya tasse tenna autalde.
When you come into the house, greet it,	Íre tulilde mir i coa, ása suila,
and if the house is worthy, may the peace that you wish for it come upon it, but if it is not worthy, may the peace from you return to you.	ar qui i coa valda ná, nai i raine ya merilde san tuluva sanna, mal qui uas valda, nai i raine lello nanwenuva lenna.
Whenever anyone does not receive you or listens to your words, when you go away form that house or from that city, shake the dust from your feet .	Quiquie aiquen ua came le hya lasta quettaldannar, íre autalde sana coallo hya sana ostollo, á pale i asto taluldalto.
Truly I say to you: The Day of Judgement will be more bearable for the land of Sodom than for that city!	Násie quetin lenna: I Aure Namiéva nauva ambe cólima Soromo nóren epe sana oston!
Behold! I send you like sheep among wolves. Therefore be intelligent like serpents and guiltless like doves.	Yé! Mentan le ve mámar mici ñarmor. Etta na hande ve leucar ar cámalóre ve cucuar.
Watch yourselves against men, for they will give you over to tribunals and will flay you in their synagogues.	Tira inde atannar, an antauvalte le olla námocombin ar le-riptuvalte yomencoaltassen.
You will be led before governors and kings concernin me, as a witness to them and to the nations.	Nauvalde tulyane epe nórecánor ar arani pa inye, ve vettie tien ar i nórin.
But when they give you over, do not be troubled about how or what you are to say, for which you are to say will be given to you in that hour.	Mal íre antalte le olla, áva na tarastaine pa manen hya mana quetuvalde, an ya quetuvalde nauva len antana lúme entasse.
For that speak are not only you, but your Father's Spirit that speaks by you.	An i quetir uar rie lé, mal Atareldo Faire ye quete lénen.
Furthermore, brother will give brother over to death, and a father his child, and children will rise against their parents and will cause their death.	Ente, háno antauva olla háno qualmenna, ar atar hínarya, ar híni ortuvar ontarultanta ar tyaruvar qualmetta.
And you will be hated by all concerning my name, but who endures to the end, he will he saved.	Ar elde nauva tévine lo illi pa essenya, mal ye perpere i mettanna, isse nauva rehtana.
When they pursue you in this city, flee to another, for truly I say to you: By no means will you complete the circuit of the cities of Israel before the Son of Man shall come.	Íre roitalte le osto sinasse, uşa hyananna, an násie quetin lenna: Laume telyuvalde i rinde ostoron Israélo nó i Atanyondo tuluva.
A disciple is not above who instructs him, or a slave above his lord.	Hildo ua or ye peanta se, hya mól or herurya.
It suffices for the disciple if he becomes like who instructs him, and the slave like his lord. If people called the householder Beelzebul, how much more will they call the people of his house so?	Farya i hildon qui olis ve ye peanta se, ar i mól ve herurya. Qui queni estaner i coantur Vélsevul, manen ita ambe estuvalte i queni coaryo sie?
Therefore do not fear them. For there is nothing covered that will not be revealed, and nothing secret that will not be known.	Etta áva ruce tello. An ea munta tópina ya ua nauva apantana, ar munta nulda ya ua nauva sinwa.
 which I tell you in the darkness, say in the light, and which you hear being whispered, make it known from the tops of the houses.	Ya nyarin len i morniesse, queta i calasse, ar ya hlarilde hlussaina, ása care sinwa ingallon i coaron.
And not do fear those that kills the body but cannot kill the soul; sooner fear that can undo soul and body alike in Gehenna.	Ar áva ruce illon nahtar i hroa mal uar pole nahta i fea; ambe rongo ruca yello pole nancare fea ar hroa véla Ehennasse.
But are not two sparrows sold for a piece of copper? And yet one among them does not fall to the ground without your Father's knowledge.	Ma uat filit atta vácine mittan urusteva? Ananta er mici tú ua lanta i talamenna pen Atareldo istya.
But also all the hairs on your head are counted.	Mal yando ilye i findi careldasse nar nótine.
Therefore do not fear; you are more precious than many sparrows.	Etta áva ruce; nalde mirwe epe rimbe filici.
Therefore everyone that confesses me before men, I as well will confess before my father who is in heaven;	Etta ilquen ye etequeta ni epe atani, yú inye etequetuva epe Atarinya ye ea menelde;
but anyone that denies me before men, I as well will deny before my Father who is in heaven.	mal aiquen ye láquete ni epe atani, yú inye laquetuva epe Atarinya ye ea menelde.
Do not think that I have come to put peace on earth; I have not come to put peace , but a sword.	Áva sana i utúlien panien raine cemende; uan túle panien raine, mal macil.
For I came to cause splits: a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a young wife against the mother of her husband;	An túlen tyarien şancier: nér ataryanna, ar selye amilleryanna, ar nessa veri i amillenna veruryo;
and a man's enemies are the people of his house.	ar atano ñottor nar i queni coaryasse.
If a person's father or mother is dearer to him than I , he is not worthy of me; and if a person's son or daughter is dearer to him than me, he is not worthy of me.	Qui queno atar hya amil ná sen melda epe ni, uas valda nin; ar qui queno yondo hya selye ná sen melda epe ni, uas valda nin.
And anyone that does not take his cross and follows me is not worthy of me.	Ar aiquen ye ua mapa tarwerya ar hilya ni ua valda nin.
 one that finds his life, to him it shall be lost, but the person whose life becomes lost for my sake , will find it.	Ye hire cuilerya, sen nauvas vanwa, mal i quén yeo cuile ole vanwa márienyan, hiruva sa.
 that receives you receives also me, and that receives me receives also the one who sent me.	Ye came lé came yú ni, ar ye came ni came yú ye ni-mentane.
 that receives a prophet since he is a prophet, will receive a prophet's reward, and that receives a just man since he is just, will receive a just man's reward.	Ye came Erutercáno pan náse Erutercáno, camuva Erutercáno paityale, ar ye came faila nér pan náse faila, camuva faila nero paityale.
And anyone that gives to a person among these small ones only a cup of cold water since he is a disciple – truly I say to you, his reward will by no means be lost to him.	Ar aiquen ye anta quenen mici pityar sine rie yulma ringa neno pan náse hildo – násie quetin lenna, paityalerya laume nauva vanwa sen.
After Jesus finished commanding his twelve disciples, he sent them forth from there, to teach and to make the message known in their cities.	Apa Yésus telyane cane hildoryain yunque, etementanes te talo, peantien ar carien i menta sinwa ostoltassen.
But John, hearing about him in prison, sent by his own disciples	Mal Yoháno, hlárala pa se mandosse, mentane vére hildoryainen
and said to him: “Are you who is going to come, or are we waiting for another?”	ar quente senna: “Ma elye ná ye tulumne, hya hópalme exen?”
In answer Jesus said to them: “Go away and tell John that you are hearing and that you are seeing:	Hanquentasse Yésus quente téna: “Á auta ar nyara Yohánon yar hláralde ar yar cénalde:
The blind see again, and the lame walk, the leprous are being cleansed and the deaf are hearing, and the dead are being raised, and the poor ones are hearing the gospel made known,	I laceníti cenir ata, ar i lalevíti vantar, i halmahlaiwar nar poitaine ar i hlárelórar hlárar, ar i qualinar nar ortaine, ar i penyar hlárar i evandilyon carna sinwa,
and happy is the one that in me finds nothing turning him away.	ar valima ná ye inyesse hire munta quérala se oa.
When they went away, Jesus began to speak to the crowd concerning John: “What did you go forth into the desert to see? A sedge moving by the wind?	Íre té oanter, Yésus yestane carpa i şanganna pa Yoháno: “Mana etelendelde mir i erume cenien? Lisce lévala i súrinen?
No, what did you go forth to see? A man having soft clothes? Behold, those that have soft clothes are in the houses of kings!	Lá, mana etelendelde cenien? Nér arwa mussi lannaron? Yé, i arwar mussi lannaron ear coassen araniva!
But for what reason did you go forth? Seeing a prophet? Yes, I say to you, and far more than a prophet!	Mal mana castanen etelendelde? Cenie Erutercáno? Ná, quetin lenna, ar ambela Erutercáno!
He is the person of whom is written: “Behold, I send my herald in front of you, in order to prepare your way before you.	Isse ná i quén pa ye ná técina: 'Yé, inye menta tercánonya epe lye, manwien mallelya epe lye.'
Truly I say to you: Among that are born by women, no one is greater than John the Baptist, but the smallest in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.	Násie quetin lenna: Mici i nar nóne lo nissi, úquen ná túra epe Yoháno i Sumbando, mal i ampitya menelo araniesse ná túra epe sé.
But from the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and those that do violence seize it.	Mal ho réryar Yoháno i Sumbando tenna sí, menelo aranie perpere orme, ar i carir orme mapar sa.
For all the prophets and the Law spoke their prophecies until John,	An ilye i Erutercánor ar i Şanye quenter apaceniltar tenna Yoháno,
and if you wish to receive it, he is Elijah that was going to come.	ar qui merilde came sa, náse Elía ye tulumne.
 who has ears, may he hear!	Ye same hlaru, nai hlaruvas!
With what am I to compare this generation? They are like children sitting in the market places , crying to the other children: 'We played the flute for you, but you did not dance; we were wailing, but you did not beat yourselves in grief.'	As mana sestuvan nónare sina? Nalte ve híni hámala i mancanómessen, yámala i hyane hínannar: 'Tyaldelme i simpe len, mal ualde liltane; anelme yaimie, mal ualde pente inde nairesse.'
For John came without eating or drinking, and people say: 'He is possessed by a demon!'	An Yoháno túle pen matie hya sucie, ar queni quetir: 'Náse haryana lo rauco!'
The Son of Men came eating and drinking, and people say: 'Look! A man given to gluttony and to drinking wine, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!' And yet Wisdom has been made shown righteous by its deeds!”	I Atanyondo túle matila ar sucila, ar queni quetir: 'Ela! Nér antana lapten ar sucien limpe, meldo tungwemoron ar úcarindoron!' Ananta Sailie anaie tanana faila cardaryainen!”
Then he began to rebuke the cities where his most numerous of his mighty deeds happened, since they failed to find repentance: “Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty deeds that have happened in you happened in Tyre or Sidon, long ago they sought repentance in sackcloth and ash!	Tá yestanes naitya i ostor yasse i amarimbar túrie cardaryaron martaner, pan loitanelte hire inwis: “Horro lyen, Corasin! Horro lyen, Vet-Saira! An au i túrie cardar yar amartier letse martaner mi Tír hya Síron, andanéya cestanelte inwis mi findilanne ar litte!
Therefore I say to you: To Tyre and Sidon the Day of Judgement will be more bearable than it will be for you . 	Etta quetin lenna: Tíren ar Síronen i Aure Namiéva nauva cólima epe ya nauvas lent!
And you, Capernaum, will you be raised to heaven? Down to Mandos you will come, for if the mighty deeds that happened in you happened in Sodom, that city stood until this day.	Ar elye, Capernaum, ma nauval ortana menelenna? Undu Mandostonna tuluval, an au i túrie cardar yar martaner lyesse martaner Soromesse, tana osto tarne tenna aure sina.
Therefore I say to you: To the land of Sodom the day of Judgment will be more bearable than it will be for you!”	Etta quetin lenna: Soromo nóren i Aure Namiéva nauva cólima epe ya nauvas len!”
At that time Jesus rose his voice and said: “I praise you, Father, Lord over heaven and earth, since you have hid these things from the wise and intelligent, and has revealed them to babes!	Yana lúmesse Yésus ortane ómarya ar quente: “Laitan tye, Átar, Heru or menel cemenye, pan unurtiel nati sine i sailallon ar handallon ar ápantie tai vinimoin!
Yes, Father, for doing so was what pleased you!	Ná, Átar, an carie sie náne ya fastane tye!
All things are given to me by my Father, and no one wholly knows the Son except the Father; furthermore, no one wholly knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son wishes to reveal him.	Ilye nati nar nin antane lo Atarinya, ar úquen aqua ista i Yondo hequa i Atar; ente, úquen aqua ista i Atar hequa i Yondo ar aiquen yen i Yondo mere apanta se.
Come to me, all that toil and carry heavy burdens, and I will give you rest!	Tula ninna, illi i mótar ar colir lunge cólar, ar antauvan lyen sére!
Put my yoke on yourselves and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.	Á panya yaltanya indesse ar para nillo, an nanye moica ar nalda endasse, ar hiruvalde sére fealdain.
For my yoke is gentle, and my burden light.	An yaltanya malda ná, ar cólanya alalunga!”
At that time Jesus went through the corn-fields on the day of rest. His disciples were hungry and started to pick heads or grain to eat.	Lúme yanasse Yésus lende ter i orirestar i sendaresse. Hildoryar náner maite ar yestaner lepta i cari oriva matien.
And seeing this the Pharisees said to him: “Behold! Your disiciples do what is not alloewd to do on the day of rest!”	Ar cénala si i Farisar quenter senna: “Ela! Hildolyar carir ya ua lávina care i sendaresse!”
He said to them: “Have you not read about what David did when he and the men with him were hungry.	Quentes téna: “Ma ualde ehentanie pa ya Lavir carne íre isse ar i neri óse náner maite?
He went into God's house and ate the breads of showing, which were not allowed food for him or for those that were with him, but for the priests alone?	Lendes mir i coa Eruva ar mantelte i massar taniéva, yar úner lávina matta sen hya i náner óse, mal rie i airimoin
Or have you not read in the Law that on the day of rest the priests in the temple break the sabbath and yet are without guilt?	Hya ualde ehentanie i Şanyesse i mi sendare i airimor i cordasse racir i sendare ananta nar pen cáma?
But I say to you that here is which is greater than the temple.	Mal quetin lenna i sisse ea ya ná túra epe i corda.
But if you understood what this word means: 'I want mercy, and not sacrifice', you did not judge those that are without guilt.	Mal qui hanyanelde ya quetta sina tea: 'Merin óravie, ar lá yanca,' ualde namne i nar pen cáma.
For the Son of Man is Lord of the day of rest!”	An i Atanyondo ná Heru i sendareo!”
After he went away from there he came into their synagogue.	Apa oantes talo túles mir yomencoalta.
And behold! was there a man having a withered hand.	Ar yé! enge tasse nér arwa hessa máo.
He said to them: “Who is the man among you having a single sheep who does not, if this sheep falls into a hollow on the day of rest, take hold of it and lift it out?	Quentes téna: “Man ná i nér mici te arwa erya mámo ye ua, qui máma sina lanta mir unque i sendaresse, se-mapuva ar se-ortuva ettenna?
But how more precious than a sheep is a man! Thus is allowed to do good on the day of rest!”	Mal manen ambe mirwa epe máma ná atan! Sie ná lávina care márie i sendaresse!”
Then he said to the man: “Reach out with your hand!” And he reached out with it, and it was renewed and was like the other hand.	Tá quentes i nerenna: “Á rahta mályanen!” Ar rahtanes sanen, ar anes envinyanta ar náne ve i hyana má.
But the Pharisees went outside and made plans about how they were going to destroy him.	Mal i Farisar lender ettenna ar carner panoli pa manen nancarumneltes.
Knowing that, Jesus went away from there. Numerous ones also followed him, and he healed all among them,	Istala ta, Yésus oante talo. Rimbali yú hilyaner se, ar nestanes illi mici te,
but he commanded them firmly that they were not to make him known,	mal cannes te tulcave i ávalte carumne se sinwa,
to fulfill which was said through Isaiah the Prophet, who said:	carien anwa ya náne quétina ter Yesaia i Erutercáno, ye quente:
“Behold! My servant whom I have chosen, my beloved one, by whom my soul is pleased. I shall put my spirit in him, and justice he will make known to the nations.	“Yé! Núronya ye ilcílien, meldanya, pa ye feanya ná fastana. Panyuvan fairenya sesse, ar anan caruvas sinwa i nórennar.
He shall not quarrel or cry, and no one will hear his voice on the roads.	Uas costuva hya yamuva, ar úquen hlaruva ómarya i mallessen.
A broken sedge he shall not crush, and a smouldering wick he shall not extinguish, until he brings justice to victory.	Rácina lisce uas ascatuva, ar yúlala urulanya uas luhtyuva, tenna taluvas anan apairenna.
And in his name the nations shall put their hope!”	Ar esseryasse i nóri panyuvar estelelta!”
Then they brought to him a demon-possessed person, blind and dumb, and he healed him, causing the dumb man to talk and see.	Tá tallelte senna raucoharyaina nér, laceníte ar úpa, ar nestanes se, tyárala i úpa nér carpa ar cene.
And all the crowd were beside themselves with wonder, and they said: “Maybe this man is the Son of David!”	Ar ilye i şangar náner ara inte elmendanen, ar quentelte: “Cé nér sina ná i Lavirion!”
Hearing that, the Pharisees said: “This man does not throw out the demons except by the lord of the demons, Beelzebub!”	Hlárala ta, i Farisar quenter: “Nér sina ua et-hate i raucor hequa herunen i raucoron, Vélsevuv!”
Knowing their thoughts, he said to them: “Every kingdom split against itself is made void, and every city and house split against itself will not stand.	Istala sanweltar, quentes téna: “Ilya aranie şanca insanna ná carna lusta, ar ilya osto ar coa şanca insanna ua taruva.
And if Satan throws out Satan, he is split against himself; then how will his kingdom stand?	Ar qui Sátan et-hate Sátan, náse şanca insenna; tá manen aranierya taruva?
Furthermore, if I throw out the demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your sons throw them out? Therefore they will be your judges.	Ente, qui inye et-hate i raucor Vélsevuvnen, mannen yondoldar et-hatir te? Etta té nauvar námoldar.
But if by God's spirit I throw out the demons, God's kingdom has indeed come to you.	Mal qui Eruo fairenen inye et-hate i raucor, Eruo aranie é utúlie lenna.
Or how can anyone go into the house of a strong man and take his goods, if he does not firstly bind the strong man? And then he will steal the things in his house.	Hya manen aiquen pole lelya mir i coa polda nerwa ar mapa armaryar, qui uas minyave nute i polda nér? Ar tá piluvas i nati coaryasse.
 who is not with me is my enemy, ar who does not gather with me, scatters.	Ye ua asinye ñottonya ná, ar ye ua comya asinye, vinta.
Therefore I say to you: Every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven to Men, but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.	Etta quetin lenna: Ilya úcare ar naiquetie nauva apsénina Atanin, mal naiquetie i Fairenna ua nauva apsénina.
For anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man, to him it will be forgiven, but who speaks against the Holy spirit, that will not be forgiven him, in this age and the coming one alike.	An aiquen ye quete quetta i Atanyondonna, sen nauvas apsénina, mal ye quete i Airefeanna, ta ua nauva apsénina sen, mi randa sina ar i tulila véla.
Make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree rotten and its fruit rotten; for by its fruit the tree is known.	Cara i alda mára ar yáverya mára, hya cara i alda quelexa ar yáverya quelexa; an yáveryanen i alda sinwa ná.
Offspring of snakes, how can you say good things, you who are evil? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.	Onnar leucoron, manen polilde quete máre nati, elde i nar ulce? An et i endo úvello i anto quete.
The good man brings good things from his good treasure, but the bad man brings wicked things from his bad treasure.	I mára atan tala máre nati mára harmaryallo, mal i olca nér tala olce nati olca harmaryallo.
I say to you that concerning every saying that men say that is not beneficial, they will answer on the Day of Judgement,	Quetin lyenna i pa ilya quetie ya atani quetir ya ua aşea, hanquetuvalte Auresse Namiéva,
for by your own words you will be judged righteous, and by your own words you will be judged evil!”	an vére quettalyainen nauval námina faila, ar vére quettalyainen nauval námina ulca!”
Then some among Pharisees answered him: “Teacher, we wish to see a sign from you!”	Tá queneli mici Farisar hanquenter senna: “Peantar, merilme cene tanwa lyello!”
In answer he said to them: “A wicked and unfaithful generation is seeking a sign, but a sign will not be given to it, except the sign of Jonah the Prophet.	Hanquentasse quentes téna: “Olca ar úvoronda nónare cestea tanwa, mal tanwa ua nauva antana san, hequa Yóna i Erutercáno tanwa.
For like Jonah was in the inward part of the big fish for three days and three nights, so the Son of Man will be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights.	An tambe Yóna náne i hoa lingwio mityasse auressen nelde ar lómissen nelde, síve i Atanyondo euva cemeno endasse auressen nelde ar lómissen nelde.
Men from Ninive will arise in the judgement with this generation and will judge it evil, for they found repentance when Jonah made his message known, but behold! here is what is greater than Jonah!	Neri Ninivello ortuvar i namiesse as nónare sina ar namuvar sa ulca, an té hirner inwis íre Yóna carne mentarya sinwa, mal ye! sisse ea ya ná túra lá Yóna.
The queen of the South will rise in the judgment with this generation and will judge it evil, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold! here is what is greater than Solomon.	Hyarmeno tári ortuva i namiesse as nónare sina ar namuva sa ulca, an túles cemeno mettallon hlarien Solomondo sailie, ar yé! sisse ea ya ná túra lá Solomon.
When an unclean spirit comes out from a man, it passes through dry places seeking a place of rest, but it does not find .	Íre úpoica faire ettule nerello, lahtas ter parce nómi cestala nóme séreva, mal uas hire.
Then it says: “I will return to my house from which I moved,” and coming to it, it finds the house empty, but clean and adorned.	Tá quetis: “Nanwenuvan coanyanna yallo léven”, ar túlala sanna, hiris i coa lusta, mal poica ar netyana.
Then it goes away and brings with itself seven other spirits, more wicked than itself, and after going inside they dwell there, and that man's final state is worse than the first! So it will be also for this wicked generation!”	Tá lelyas oa ar tala as inse hyane fairi otso, olce lá inse, ar apa menie minna marilte tasse, ar tana nero métima sóma ná faica lá i minya! Sie euva yú olca nónare sinan!”
As he was still speaking to the crowds, look! his mother and his brothers stood on the outside and wished to speak with him.	Íre en quétanes i şangannar, yé! amillerya ar hánoryar tarner i ettesse ar merner carpa óse.
And someone said to him: “Behold! Your mother and your brothers are standing on the outside, wishing to speak with you!”	Ar quén quente senna: “Yé! Amillelya ar hánolyar tárar i ettesse, mérala carpa aselye!”
In answer he said to who spoke to him: “Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?”	Hanquentasse quentes yenna carampe senna: “Man ná amillinya, ar man nar hánonyar?”
And reaching out with his hand towards his disciples he said: “Behold my mother and my brothers!	Ar rahtala máryanen hildoryannar quentes: “Ela amillinya ar hánonyar!
Anyone who does the will of my father who is in heaven, he is my brother and sister and mother!”	Aiquen ye care i indóme Atarinyo ye ea menelde, isse ná hánonya ar néşanya ar amillinya!”
On that day Jesus, after he went from the house, was sitting beside the sea,	Aure yanasse Yésus, apa lendes i coallo, hámane ara i ear,
and great crowds gathered to him. Therefore he went into a boat and sat down, while the entire crowd was standing on the beach.	ar hoe şangali ócomner senna. Etta lendes mir lunte ar hamune, íre i quanda şanga tárane i fárasse.
Then he spoke to them many things in comparisons, saying: “Look! A sower went out to sow.	Tá quentes téna rimbe natali sestielissen, quétala: “Yé! Rerindo lende ettenna rerien.
As he was sowing some seems fell beside the road, and the birds came and ate them.	Rerieryasse erdeli lantaner ara i malle, ar i aiwi túler ar manter tai.
Others fell upon the rock, where they did not have deep soil, and they came up quickly, for lacking deep soil.	Exeli lantaner i ondonna, yasse ualte sáme núra cemen, ar orontelte lintiénen, peniénen núra cemen.
But when the Sun came up, they were scorched, and for lacking root they withered.	Mal íre Anar oronte, anelte urtane, ar peniénen şundo hestanelte.
Others fell among the thorns, and the thorns came up and quoked them.	Exeli lantaner imíca i neceli, ar i neceli túler ama ar quorner te.
But others fell upon the good soil and made fruit – one, a hundred added measures, another, sixty, another, thirty.	Mal exeli lantaner i mára cemenna ar carner yáve – mine, napánine lestali tuxa, exe, enenquean, exe, nelequean.
Who has ears, may he be hearing!	Ye same hlaru, nai sé hlára!”
And the disciples came to him and said: “What is your reason for speaking to them in comparisons?”	Ar i hildor túler senna ar quenter: “Mana castalya carpien téna sestiessen?”
In reply he said: “To you it is given to understand the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to those people it is not given.	Hanquentasse quentes: “Len ná antana hanya menelo araniéno fóler, mal sane quenin uas antana.
For who has, more will be given to him, and he shall receive abundance – but who does not have, also what he has will be taken from him.	An ye same, amba nauva sen antana, ar camuvas úve – mal ye ua same, yando ya samis nauva mapana sello.
Therefore I speak to them in comparisons, since looking they will not see, and hearing they will not perceive or understand,	Etta carpan téna sestiessen, pan yétala ualte cenuva, ar hlárala ualte tuntuva hya hanyuva,
and concerning them Isaiah's prophecy is made true: 'By hearing they will hear, but they do not understand, and by looking they will look, but they will not see.	ar pa té Yesaio apacen ná carna nanwa: 'Hlariénen hlaruvalde, mal ualde hanya, ar yétiénen yétuvalde, mal ualde cene.
For this people's heart has been made fat, and with their ears they hear without reply, and they have shut their eyes; thus they will not ever see with their eyes or hear with their ears and understand with their heart and find repentence, for me to heal them!”	An lie sino enda anaie carna tiuca, ar hlarultanten hlarilte ú hanquento, ar oholtielte hendultat; sie ualte oi cenuva hendultanten hya hlaruva hlarultanten ar hanyuva endaltanen ar hiruva inwis, nestienyan te!”
But happy are your eyes, for they look, and your ears, for they hear.	Mal valime nát henduldat, an yétatte, ar hlaruldat, an hlaritte.
And truly I say to you: Numerous prophets and righteous one wanted to see that you are looking at, but they did not see them, and hear the things that you hear, but they did not hear them.	An násie quetin lenna: Rimbe Erutercánoli ar failali merner cene yar elde yétar, mal ualte cenner tai, ar hlare i nati yar elde hlarir, mal ualte hlasse tai.
Therefore, you hear the comparison about the sower:	Etta, elde hlara i sestie pa i rerindo:
When anyone hears the word of the kingdom but does not understand it, the Wicked One comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart; this is which was sown by the road.	Íre aiquen hlare i quetta i araniéno mal ua hanya sa, i Olca tule ar rapa oa ya anaie rérina endaryasse; si ná ye náne rérina ara i malle.
And that was sown upon the rock, that is who hears the word and receives it in joy.	Ar ye náne rérina i ondosse, ta ná ye hlare i quetta ar came sa mi alasse.
And yet he does not have root in himself but remains for a time, but when tribulation or persecution happens because of the word, he falls away in the same moment.	Ananta uas same şundo insesse mal lemya ter lúme, mal íre şangie hya roitie marta i quettanen, lantas oa mi imya lú.
And that was sown among the thorns, this is who is hearing the word, but the concerns of this age and the temptation of riches choke the word, and it is without fruit.	Ar ye náne rérina imíca i neceli, si ná ye hlára i quetta, mal randa sino quáreler ar i laro úsahtie quorir i quetta, ar náse ú yáveo.
And who was sown on the good earth, this is who is hearing the word and understands it, who indeed bears fruit and makes added measures – this person, a hundred, another, sixty, another, thirty.	Ar ye náne rérina i mára cemende, si ná ye hlára i quetta ar hanya sa, ye é cole yáve ar care napánine lestali – quén sina, tuxa, exe, enenquean, exe, nelequean!”
Another comparison he put before them, saying: “The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.	Hyana sestie panyanes epe te, quétala: “Menelo aranie ná ve nér ye rende mára erde restaryasse.
When people were asleep, his enemy came and sowed worthless plants among the grain, and went away.	Íre queni náner lorne, ñottorya túle ar rende úmirwe olvali imíca i ore, are oante.
When the leaf sprouted and made fruit, then also the worthless plants came up.	Íre i lasse tuiane ar carne yáve, tá yando i úmirwe olvar túler ama.
Therefore the householder's slaves came and said to him: “Lord, did you not sow good seed in your field? From where does it have worthless plants?”	Etta i coanturo móli túler ar quenter senna: “Heru, ma ualye rende mára erde restalyasse? Mallo samis úmirwe olvali?”
He said to them: “An enemy, a man, has done this thing!” They said to him: “Do you want that we will go to gather them?”	Quentes téna: “Ñotto, nér, acárie nat sina!” Quentelte senna: “Ma meril i menuvalme comien te?”
He said: “No; or maybe you will pull up the grain with the worthless plants.	Eques: “Vá; hya cé tucuvalde ama yando i ore as i úmirwe olvar.
Let both grow until the harvest, and when the harvest shall come, I will say to the ones that will reap: First gather the worthless plants and bind them into bunches to be burnt; then go to gather the grain into my barn!”	Lava yúyon ale tenna i yávie, ar íre i yávie tuluva, quetuvan innar cirihtuvar: Minyave á comya i úmirwe olvar ar nuta te mir loxi náven urtaine; tá mena comien i ore mir hauranya!”
Another comparison he put before them, saying: “The kingdom of heaven is like a seed of mustard, which a man took and planted in his field.	Hyana sestie panyanes epe te, quétala: “Menelo aranie ná ve erde sinapio, ya nér nampe ar empanne restaryasse.
That is the smallest of all seeds, but having grown it is the biggest of the vegetables and has been made a tree, and so heaven's birds came and find rest in its branches!”	Ta ná i ampitya ilye erdion, mal álienwa náse i anhoa i quearon ar anaie carna alda, ar sie menelo aiwi tulir ar hirir sére olvaryassen!”
Another comparison he said to them: “The kingdom of heaven is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three big measures of flour, until everything was raised!”	Hyana sestie quentes téna: “Menelo aranie ná ve pulmaxe, ya nís nampe ar nurtane hoe lestassen nelde moleva, tenna ilqua náne ortaina!”
All these things Jesus said to the crowds in comparisons, and without a comparison he did not speak to them,	Ilye sine nati Yésus quente i şangannar sestiessen, ar ú sestiéno uas carampe téna,
to make true which was said through the Prophet who said: “I will open my mouth in comparisons; I will make known things hidden from the foundation!”	carien nanwa ya náne quétina ter i Erutercáno ye quente. “Pantuvan antonya sestielissen; caruvan sinwe natali nurtane i tulciello!”
Then, after sending the crowds away, he went into the boat. And his disciples came to him and said: “Let us understand the comparison about the worthless plants in the field!”	Tá, apa mentie i şangar oa, lendes mir i coa. Ar hildoryar túler senna ar quenter: “Lava men hanya i sestie pa i úmirwe olvar i restasse!”
In answer he said: “ who sows the good seed is the Son of Man;	Hanquentasse eques: “Ye rere i mára erde ná i Atanyondo;
the field is the world, and the good seed, they are the sons of the kingdom, but the worthless plands are the sons of the Wicked One.	i resta ná i mar, ar i mára erde, té nar i araniéno yondor, mal i úmirwe olvar nar i Olco yondor.
The enemy who sowed them is the Devil. The harvest is the end of the age, the reapers are angels.	I ñotto ye rende te ná i Arauco. I yávie ná i rando tyel, i cirihtor nar vali.
Therefore, as when the worthless plants are gathered and burnt by fire, so it will be at the conclusion of the age:	Etta, ve íre i úmirwe olvar nar comyaine ar urtaine nárenen, sie euva i rando tyelde:
The Son of Man will send his angles, and they will gather out of his kingdom all things that cause people to fall and the people that break the law,	I Atanyondo mentuva valaryar, ar comyuvalte et aranieryallo ilye nati yar tyarir queni lanta ar i queni i racir i şanye,
and they will thrown them into the oven of fire. There will be their tears and their grinding of teeth.	ar hatuvaltet mir i urna náreva. Tasse euvar nieltar ar mulielta nelciva.
Then the righteous ones will shine like the Sun, in their Father's kingdom. who has hears, let him be hearing!	Tá i failar caltuvar ve Anar, Atarelto araniesse. Ye same hlaru, nai hláras!
The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field, which a man found and hid, and for his joy he goes away and sells the things that he has, and trades to himself that field.	Menelo aranie ná ve harma nurtana i restasse, ya nér hirne ar nurtane, ar alasseryanen autas ar vace i nati yar samis, ar mancas insen resta tana.
Again the kingdom of heaven is like a tradesman seeking good pearls:	Ata menelo aranie ná ve macar cestala máre marillar:
After finding one pearl that was most precious, he went away and sold everything that he had and traded it to himself.	Apa hirie er marilla ya náne ammirwa, oantes ar vance ilqua ya sámes ar mancane sa insen.
Again the kingdom of heaven is like a net, thrown into the sea and gathering fishes of every kind.	Ata menelo aranie ná ve rembe, hátina mir i ear ar comyala lingwili ilya nostaleo.
When it was full, they pulled it up onto the beach and sat down and gathered the good ones into vessels, but the worthless ones they threw away.	Íre anes quanta, tunceltes ama i fáranna ar hamuner ar comyaner i márar mir veneli, mal i úmirwar hantelte oa.
Thus it will be at the conclusion of the age: The angels will go forth and will separate the wicked from the righteous,	Sie euva mí rando tyel: I vali etelelyuvar ar hyamuvar i olcar i failallon,
and they will throw them into the fiery oven. There will be their tears and their grinding of teeth.	ar hatuvaltet mir i uruite urna. Tasse euvar nieltar ar mulielta nelciva.
Do you understand all these things?” They said to him: “Yes!”	Ma hanyanelde ilye sine nati?” Quentelte senna: “Ná!”
Then he said to them: “Therefore every scribe, instructed about the kingdom of heaven, is like a man, a householder, who brings out from his treasure things new and old!”	Tá quentes téna: “Etta ilya parmangolmo, peantana pa menelo aranie, ná ve nér, coantur, ye tala et harmaryallo vinyali ar yárali!”
And then, after Jesus completed these comparisons, he crossed land from there.	Ar tá, apa Yésus telyane sestier sine, lahtanes nóre talo.
And when he came to his home territory, he instructed them in their synagogue. Thus they were filled with wonder and said: “From where did this man receive this wisdom and these mighty deeds?	Ar íre túles vehteryanna, peantanes tien yomencoaltasse. Sie anelte quátine elmendanen ar quenter: “Mallo nér sina camne sailie sina ar i taure cardar sine?
Is this not the carpenter's son? Is his mother not Mary, and his brothers Jacob and Joseph and Simon and Juda?	Ma si ua i tautamo yondo? Ma amillerya ua estaina María, ar hánoryar Yácov ar Yósef ar Símon ar Yúra?
And his sisters, are they not all with us? Where, then, did this man receive all these things?”	Ar néşaryar, ma ualte illi aselve? Masse, tá, nér sina camne ilye sine nati?”
Therefore they were angry with him. But Jesus said to them: “A prophet does not lack honor except in his home territory and in his house!”	Etta anelte rúşie senna. Mal Yésus quente téna: “Erutercáno ua pene laitie hequa vehteryasse ar coaryasse!”
And he did not do numerous mighty deeds there, since they lacked faith.	Ar uas carne tasse rimbe taure cardali, pan pennelte savie.
At that time Herod the Farthing-ruler heard the story about Jesus,	Lúme yanasse Herol i Canastatur hlasse i nyarna pa Yésus,
and he said to his servants: “This is John the Baptist. He has been raised from the dead, and therefore the mighty deeds happen by him!”	ar quentes núroryannar: “Si ná Yoháno i Sumbando. Anaies ortana qualinallor, ar etta i taure cardar martar sénen!”
For Herod formerly took John and bound him and put him in jail, by reason of Herodias, the wife of Filip his brother.	An Herol yá nampe Yohannes ar nunte se ar se-panyane mandosse, castanen Heroliasso, Filip hánoryo veri.
For John said to him: “You are not allowed to have her!”	An Yohannes quente senna: “Ualye lerta same se!”
But though he wanted to kill him, he feared the crowd, for they thought about him as a prophet.	Mal ómu mernes nahta se, runces i şangallo, an sannes pa se ve Erutercáno.
But when they were festive on Herod's birthday, Herodias' daughter danced on it and gave Herod a joy so great	Man íre anelte merye Herolo nónaresse, Heroliasso selye liltane sasse ar antane Herolen alasse ta hoa
that he spoke a promise to her: He was going to give her anything that she was going to request.	i quentes hén vanda: Antauvanes hén aiqua ya arcumnes.
Then, instructed by her mother, she said: “Give me here on a plate John the Baptist's head!”	Tá, peantaina lo amillerya, hé quente: “Ánin anta sisse venesse Yoháno i Sumbando cas!”
Though that caused him grief, the king commanded that one was to give it to the maiden,	Ómu ta tyarne sen naire, i aran canne i mo antauvane sa i venden,
and he sent and cut off John's head in the prison.	ar mentanes ar hocirne Yoháno cas i mandosse.
And his head was brought on a platter and given to the maiden, and she brought it to her mother.	Ar carya náne talana venesse ar antana i venden, ar hé talle sa amilleryanna.
And his disciples came and took away the corpse and brought him to a grave, and they came and told Jesus.	Ar hildoryar túler ar namper oa i loico ar taller se sapsanna, ar túlelte ar nyarner Yésun.
When he heard it, Jesus went away from there in a boat, to a lonely place, to be alone; but the crowds heard it and followed him on foot from the cities.	Ire hlasses sa, Yésus lende oa talo luntesse, eressea nómenna, náven erinqua; mal i şangar hlasser sa ar hilyaner se talunen i ostollon.
And when he came he saw a huge crowd, and his heart went out to them, and he healed their sick ones.	Ar íre túles cennes hoa şanga, ar endarya etelende téna, ar nestanes hlaiwaltar.
But when evening fell, his diciples came to him and said: “The place is lonely, and the hour is late even now; send the crowds away, for them to to into the villages to trade to themselves food!”	Mal íre şinye lantane, hildoryar túler senna ar quenter: “I nóme eressea ná, ar i lúme ná telwa yando sí; á menta i şangar oa, menieltan mir i mastor mancien inten matta!”
But Jesus said to them: “They do not have need of going away. You give them food to eat!”	Mal Yésus quente téna: “Ualte same maure autiéva. Elde áten anta matta matien!”
They said to him: “We have nothing here except five breads and two fishes!”	Quentelte senna: “Samilme munta sisse hequa massar lempe ar lingwe atta!”
He said: “Bring them here to me!”	Eques: “Á tala tai sir ninna!”
Then he commanded the crowds that they were to lie down upon the grass, and he took the five breads and two fishes, and looking up towards heaven he spoke a blessing. And after breaking the breads he distributed them to the disciples, and the disciples to the crowds.	Tá cannes i şangar i caitumnelte undu i salquenna, ar nampes i massar lempe ar lingwe atta, ar yétala ama menelenna quentes aistie. Ar apa racie i massar etsanteset i hildoin, ar i hildor i şangain.
And all ate and were filled, and they took up the remaining pieces: twelve baskets full.	Ar illi manter ar náner quátine, ar ortanelte i lemyala rantar: quante vircolcar yunque.
But those who ate were around five thousand men, except for the women and children.	Mal i manter náner os neri húmi lempe, hequa i nissi ar híni.
Then, quickly, he compelled his disiples to go into the boat and go before him to the other shore, while he sent the crowds away.	Tá, lintiénen, mauyanes hildoryar mene mir i lunte ar lelya epe se i hyana fáranna, íre mentanes i şangar oa.
And after he sent the crowds away, he went up into the mountain to a lonely place, to pray. When evening came, he was alone there.	Ar apa mentanes i şangar oa, lendes ama mir i oron eressea nómenna, hyamien. Íre şinye túle, anes erinqua tasse.
Now the boat was many hundred yards from land, being tormented by the waves, for they had the wind to their face.	Sí i lunte náne rangar rimbe tuxali norello, ñwalyaina i falmainen, an sámelte i súre cendeleltanna.
But in the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea.	Mal mí cantea tirisse i lómio túles téna, vantala i earesse.
When they saw him, they were being troubled, saying: “That is a ghost!” And for their fear they cried .	Íre cenneltes, anelte tarastaine, quétala: “Ta auşa ná!” Ar caureltanen yámelte.
But in the same moment Jesus said to them: “Courage! It is I! Do not be afraid!”	Mal mi imya lú Yésus quente téna: “Huore! Inye ná! Áva ruce!”
Peter answered him: “Lord, if that is you, command me that I am to come to you across the waters!”	Péter hanquente senna: “Heru, qui ta elye ná, ánin cane i tuluvan lyenna olla i neni!”
He said: “Come!”	Eques: “Tula!”
Then Peter, going away from the boat, walked across the waters and came to Jesus.	Tá Péter, autala i luntello, vantane olla i neni ar túle Yésunna.
But when he saw the storm, he was terrified, and when the water started to swallow him, he cried: “Lord, save me!”	Mal íre cennes i raumo, anes ruhtaina, ar íre i nén yestane hlucitas, yámes: “Heru, áni rehta!”
In the same moment Jesus reached out with his hand and seized him, and he said to him: “Man of little faith, how is that your faith was unsteady?”	Mi imya lú Yésus rahtane máryanen ar nampe se, ar quentes senna: “Nér pitya saviéno, manen ná i savielya náne iltanca?”
And after they went into the boat, the storm ceased.	Ar apa lendette mir i lunte, i raumo pustane.
Then the people in the boat bowed before him, saying: “Truly you are God's Son!” And they crossed over and came to land in Gennesaret.	Tá i queni i luntesse luhtaner epe se, quétala: “Nanwave nalye Eruo Yondo!” Ar lahtanelte ar túler norenna mi Ennesaret.
When the men of that place saw who he was, they sent into the entire surrounding country, and people brought to him all that were sick.	Íre i neri tana nómesse cenner man anes, mentanelte mir i quanda pelila nórie, ar queni taller senna illi i náner hlaiwe.
And they prayed to him that they might only touch the rim of his cloak, and all that touched it received full health.	Ar arcanelte senna i rie appumnelte collaryo lane, ar illi i appaner sa camner quanta mále.
Then came to Jesus from Jerusalem some Pharisees and scribes, saying:	Tá túler Yésunna Yerúsalemello Farisali ar parmangolmoli, quétala:
“How is that your disciples break the custom received from the elders? For they do not wash their hands before they eat food!”	“Manen ná i hildolyar racir i haime cámina i amyárallon? An ualte sove máltat nó matilte matta!”
In answer he said to them: “How is that you break God's command because of your custom?	Hanquentasse quentes téna: “Manen ná i elde racir Eruo axan haimeldanen?
For God said: 'Give glory to your father and to your mother', and: 'Anyone who speaks evil about father or mother, will without fail die.'	An Eru quente: 'Á anta alcar atarelyan yo amillelyan,' ar: 'Aiquen ye quete ulco pa atar hya amil, é qualuva.'
But you say: 'Anyone who says to his father or to his mother: 'Anything useful that you were to receive from me, is a gift to God ' –	Mal elde quetir: 'Aiquen ye quete ataryanna hya amilleryanna: 'Aiqua aşea ya camumnetye nillo, ná anna Erun' –
it is necessary for him that he does not give glory to his father or to his mother at all.	mauya sen i aqua uas anta alcar ataryan hya amilleryan.
Hypocrites, Isaiah spoke well as a prophet concerning you, when he said: This people give me glory with their lips , but their heart is far from me.	Imnatyandoli, Yesaia quente mai ve Erutercáno pa le, íre quentes: Lie sina nin-anta alcar péltanten, mal endalta ná haira nillo.
Emptily they worship me, teaching Men's teachings!”	Cumnave tyerilte ni, peantala Atanion peantier!”
And he summoned the crowd and said to them: “Listen and understand!	Ar tultanes i şanga ar quente téna: “Á lasta ar hanya!
 not which comes inside through a person's mouth soils a man, but which comes out from his mouth is which soils a man.	Lá ya tule minna ter queno anto vahta atan, mal ya ettule antoryallo ná ya vahta atan!”
Then the disciples came and said to him: “Do you know that when the Pharisees heard the word, they were angry?”	Tá i hildor túler ar quenter senna: “Ma istal in íre i Farisar hlasser i quetta, anelte rúşie?”
In answer he said: “Every plant that my heavenly Father did not plant, will be pulled up with its roots.	Hanquentasse quentes: “Ilya olva ye meneldea Atarinya ua empanne, nauva túcina ama as şunduryar.
Let them be! Blind leavers they are. But if a blind person leads a blind person, both will fall into a pit!”	Lava tien náve! Laceníti tulyandoli nalte. Mal qui laceníte quén tulya laceníte quén, yúyo lantuvat mir sapta!”
In answer Peter said to him: “Give us insight about the comparison!”	Hanquentasse Péter quente senna: “Ámen anta tercen pa i sestie!”
Then he said: “Do you as well fail to understand?	Tá quentes: “Ma yú elde loitar hanya?
Do you know know that which comes in through the mouth, goes into the entrails and passes into the sewer? 	Ma ualde ista in ilqua ya tule minna ter i anto, mene mir i hirdi ar auta mir i aucelie?
But what comes out from the mouth come out from the heart, and they soil a man!”	Mal yar ettulir i antollo ettulir i endallo, ar tai vahtar atan.
And out of the heart come evil thoughts, killings, marriage-breaking, fornication, thefts, lying testimonies, blasphemies.	An et i endallo tulir olce sanwar, nahtier, vestaleracie, úpuhtale, pilwi, húrala vettier, naiquetier.
They are that soil a man, but if a man eats food with unwashed hands, that does not soil him!”	Tai nar yar vahtar atan, mal qui atan mate matta úsóvine mánten, ta ua vahta se!”
Passing from there, Jesus now went away into the regions of Tyre and Sidon.	Autala talo, Yésus sí lende oa mir i ménar Tíro ar Sírono.
And behold! a Canaanite woman from those countries came out and cried, saying: “Have mercy on me, Son of David! My daughter is badly possessed by a demon!”	Ar yé! Canáanya nís ente nóriellon ettúle ar yáme, quétala: “Órava nisse, Lavirion! Selyenya ná ulcave haryana lo rauco!”
But he did not answer her a word. And his disciples came to him and petitioned of him, saying: “Send her away, for she is crying behind us!”	Mal isse ua hanquente senna quetta. Ar hildoryar túler senna ar arcaner senna, quétala: “Áse menta oa, an yámas ca vi!”
In answer he said: “I was not sent to anyone except to the lost sheep from the house of Israel!”	Hanquentasse eques: “Únen mentana aiquenna hequa i vanwe mámannar Israélo coallo!”
When the woman came, she bowed before him, saying: “Lord, help me!”	Íre i nís túle, luhtanes epe se, quétala: “Heru, áni manya!”
In answer he said: “It is not proper, taking the children's bread and throwing it to the dogs!”	Hanquentasse quentes: “Ua vanima mapie i hínion massa ar hatie sa i huonnar!”
She said: “Yes, Lord, but the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from the table of their lords !”	Hé quente: “Ná, Heru, mal i huor matir i mier yar lantar sarnollo herultaiva!”
Then Jesus answered her: “O woman, your faith is great; may it happen to you as you have believed!” And the daughter was healed from that hour.	Tá Yésus hanquente senna: “A nís, savielya túra ná; nai martuva lyen ve asáviel!” Ar i selye náne nestana lúme yanallo.
Crossing country from there, Jesus came near to the Sea of Galilee, and after going up into a mountain he sat down there.	Lahtala nórie talo, Yésus túre hare i Earenna Alileo, ar apa menie ama mir oron hamunes tasse.
Then great crowds came to him, bringing some that were lame, maimed , blind, dumb, and ailing in many other ways,	Tá hoe şangali túler senna, túlula queneli i náner úlévime, tapte, lalevíte, úpe, ar nimpe rimbe hyane lélissen,
and so the crowd was full of wonder when they saw the dumb ones speak or the lame walk and the blind see, and they gave glory to the God of Israel.	ar sie i şanga náne quanta elmendanen íre cennelte i úpar quéta ar i úlévimar vantea ar i lalevíti céna, ar antanelte alcar Israélo Ainon.
But Jesus summoned his disciples to himself and said: “My heart goes out to the crowd, for now they have remained with me for three days, and they have nothing to eat; and I do not want to send them away without eating. Maybe they will be too tired on the road!”	Mal Yésus tultane hildoryar insenna ar quente: “Endanya etelelya i şanganna, an sí elémielte asinye auressen nelde, ar samilte munta matien; ar uan mere menta te oa ú matiéno. Cé nauvalte acca lumbe i mallesse!”
But his disciples said to him: “From where, in this lonely place, are we to get sufficient bread for a crowd that is so big?”	Mal hildoryar quenter senna: “Mallo, mi eressea nóme sina, ñetuvalme fárea massa şangan ya ta hoa ná?”
And Jesus said to them: “What number of breads do you have?” They said: “Seven, and a few fishes!”	Ar Yésus quente téna: “Mana nóte massaron samilde?” Quentelte: “Otso, ar nótime lingwili!”
Then, after he commanded the crowd that they were to lie down on the ground,	Tá, apa cannes i şangan i caitumnelte i talamesse,
he took the seven breads and, after giving thanks, he broke them and distributed them to the disciples, and the disciples to the crowds.	nampes i matsar otso ar, apa antave hantale, rance tai ar etsante tai i hildoin, ar i hildor i şangain.
And all ate and were filled, and they gathered the remaining pieces: seven full baskets.	Ar illi manter ar náner quátine, ar comyanelte i lemyala rantar: quante vircolcar otso.
And yet those who ate were four thousand men, except for the women and children.	Ananta i manter náner neri húmi canta, hequa i nissi ar híni.
And after sending the crowds away, he went into the boat and came to the regions of Magadan.	Ar apa mentave i şangar oa, lendes mir i lunte ar túle i ménannar Maharáno.
And the Pharisees and Sadducees came to him, and to test him they asked of him that he would show them a sign from heaven.	Ar i Farisar ar Sandúcear túler senna, ar tyastien se arcanelte sello i tanumnes tien tanwa menello.
In answer he said to them: 	Hanquentasse quentes téna: 
“An evil and unfaithful generation is seeking a sign, but a sign will not be given them, except Jonah's sign!” And he went off from them and went away.	“Ulca ar úvoronda nónare cestea tanwa, mal tanwa ua nauva antaina san, hequa Yóno tanwa!” Ar oantes tello ar lende oa.
Now the disciples crossed over to the other side, and they did not remember to bring bread.	Sí i hildor lahtaner i hyana fáranna, ar ualte renne tala massa.
Jesus said to them: “Take heed and watch out concerning the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees!”	Yésus quente téna: “Cima ar ettira pa i pulmaxe Farisaron ar Sandúcearon!”
They spoke about this among themselves, saying: “We did not bring breads!”	Carampelte pa si mici inte, quétala: “Ualve talle massar!”
Knowing that, Jesus said: “How is it that you speak among yourselves about lacking breads?	Istala ta, Yésus quente: “Manen ná i carpalde mici inde pa penie massar?
Do you still not understand, and do you not recall the five breads for the five thousand, and the number of baskets that you took up?	Ma en ualde hanya, ar ualde enyale i massar lempe i húmin lempe, ar i nóte vircolcaron yar ortanelde?
Or the seven breads for the four thousand, and the number of baskets that you took up?	Hya i massar otso i húmin canta, ar i nóte vircolcaron yar ortanelde?
How, then, is you do not understand that I did not speak to you about breads? But watch out concerning the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees!”	Manen, tá, ualde hanya i uan quente lenna pa massar? Mal ettira pa i pulmaxe Farisaron ar Sandúcearon!”
Then they understood that he said to them that they were to watch out, not concerning the leaven of breads, but concerning the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.	Tá hanyanelte i quentes téna i ettirumnelte, lá pa i pulmaxe massaron, mal pa i peantie Farisaron ar Sandúcearon.
After Jesus came to the regions of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples: “Who do people say that the Son of Man is?”	Apa Yésus túle i ménannar Cesaréa Filippio, maquentes hildoryannar: “Man queni quetir in i Atanyondo ná?”
They said: “People say: John the Baptist, others: Eliah, others: Jeremiah or one of the Prophets.	Quentelte: “Queneli quetir: Yohannes i Sumbando, exeli: Elía, exeli: Yeremía hya quén i Erutercánoron!”
He said to them: “But you, who do you say that I am?”	Quentes téna: “Mal elde, man quetilde i nanye?”
In answer Peter said to him: “You are the Christ, the son of the living God!”	Hanquentasse Péter quente senna: “Elye i Hristo ná, i coirea Aino yondo!”
Jesus answered him: “Happy you are, Simon Bar-Jonah, for flesh and blood did not reveal it to you, but my heavenly Father.	Yésus hanquente senna: “Valima nalye, Símon Var-Yóna, an hráve yo serce uat apantane sa lyen, mal meneldea Atarinya.
And I say to you: You Peter, and on this rock I will build my congregation, and the gates of Mandos will not overpower it.	Ar quetin lyenna: Elye Péter, ar ondo sinasse carastuvan ocombenya, ar Mandosto andor uar turúva sa.
I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and everything that you will bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and everything that you loose on earth will be loosened in heaven!”	Antauvan lyen menelo araniéno latili, ar ilqua ya nutuvalde cemende nauva nútina menelde, ar ilqua ya lehtal cemende nauva lehtaina menelde!”
Then he firmly commanded the disciples that they were not going to say to anyone that he was the Christ.	Tá tulcave cannes i hildoin i ávalte quetumne aiquenna in anes i Hristo.
Then from that time Jesus began to show to his disciples that it was necessary for him to go to Jerusalem and to suffer many things from the elders and scribes, and to be slain, and on the third day to be raised.	Lúme yanallo Yésus yestane tana hildoryain i mauyane sen lelya Yerúsalemenna ar perpere rimbe natali ho i amyárar ar parmangolmor, ar náve nahtana, ar i nelya auresse náve ortana.
But Peter brought him aside and started to speak firmly to him, saying: “Be kind to yourself, Lord! It will by no means be so to you!”	Mal Péter talle se arana ar yestane carpa tulcave senna, quétala: “Na moica imlen, Heru! Sie laume euva elyen!”
But he turned and said to Peter: “Begone behind me, Satan! You want to cause me to fall, for you think, not God's thoughts, but those of men!”	Mal sé quernexe ar quente Péterenna: “Heca ca ni, Sátan! Meril tyare ni lanta, an sanal, lá Eruo sanwi, mal tai atanion!”
Then Jesus said to his disciples: “If anyone wishes to come after me, may he deny himself and lift up his cross and follow me.	Tá Yésus quente hildoryannar: “Qui aiquen mere tule apa ni, nai laluvas inse ar ortauva tarwerya ar hilyuva ni.
For anyone who desires to save his life, to him it will be lost; but anyone whose life is lost for my sake , will find it.	An aiquen ye mere rehta cuilerya, sen nauvas vanwa; mal aiquen yeo cuile ná vanwa márienyan, hiruva sa.
For if a man receives the whole world, but his life is lost, how is that beneficial to him?	An qui atan came i quanda mar, mal cuilerya ná vanwa, manen ta ná sen aşea?
For the Son of Man will come in his Father's glory with his angels, and then he will reward everyone according to his behavior.	An i Atanyondo tuluva Ataryo alcaresse as valaryar, ar tá paityuvas ilquenen ve lengierya.
Truly I say to you that there are some people that are standing here that by no means will taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom!”	Násie quetin lenna in ear queneli i tárar sisse i laume tyavuvar qualme nó cenilte i Atanyondo túla aranieryasse!”
Six days thereafter Jesus brought Peter and Jacob and John his brother, and led them up into a lofty mountain, they alone.	Auri enque epeta Yésus talle Péter ar Yácov ar Yohannes hánorya, ar tulyane te ama mir tára oron, té erinque.
And he was changed before them, and his face shone like the sun, and his clothes were radiant as light.	Ar anes vistana epe te, ar cendelerya caltane ve Anar, ar lanneryar náner alcarinque ve cala.
And behold! Moses and Eliah showed themselves to them, speaking with him.	Ar yé! Móses ar Elía tanner intu tien, quétala óse.
But Peter spoke and said to Jesus: “Lord, is good that we are here. If you wish, I will erect here three tents: one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah!”	Mal Péter carampe ar quente Yésunna: “Heru, vanima ná i nalme sisse! Qui meril, ortauvan sisse lancoar nelde: er lyen ar er Mósen ar er Elían!”
While the words were still in his mouth, behold! a bright cloud overshadowed them, and there was a voice out of the cloud that said: “This is my son, the beloved, with whom I am pleased; listen to him!”	Íre i quettar en náner antoryasse, yé! calima fanya teltane te, ar enge óma et i fanyallo ya quente: “Si yondonya ná, i melda, pa ye nanye fastaina; á lasta senna!”
Hearing this, the disiciples fell on their face and were extremely afraid.	Hlárala si, i hildor lantaner cendeleltasse ar náner ita caurie.
Then Jesus came near to them, and touching them he said: “Rise, and do not fear!”	Tá Yésus túle hare téna, ar appala te quentes: “Á orta, ar áva ruce!”
When they raised their eyes, they saw no one except Jesus himself.	Íre ortanelte hendultat, cennelte úquen hequa Yésus immo.
On their way down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying: “Do not tell anyone about the sigth before the Son of man has been raised from the dead!”	Tieltasse undu i orontello, Yésus canne tien, quétala: “Áva nyare aiquenen pa i cenie nó i Atanyondo anaie ortana qualinillon!”
But the disciples asked: “Then how is that the scribes say that Elijah by necessity will come first?”	Mal i hildor maquenter: “Tá manen ná in i parmangolmor quetir in Elía maurenen tuluva minyave?”
In answer he said: “Elijah will indeed come and will renew all things.	Hanquentasse eques: “Elía é tuluva ar envinyatauva ilye nati.
But I say to you that Elijah has come even now, and they did not understand who he was, but did to him as they wished. In the same manner the Son of Man will suffer at their hands.”	Mal quetin lyenna i Elía utúlie yando sí, ar ualte hanyane man anes, mal carner sen ve mernelte. Mi imya lé i Atanyondo perperuva máltanten.”
Then the disciples understood that he spoke to them about John the Baptist.	Tá i hildor hanyaner i quentes téna pa Yohannes i Sumbando.
And when they came to the crowd, a man came to him, falling to his knees before him	Ar íre túlelte i şanganna, nér túle senna, lantala occaryanta epe se
and saying: “Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is moon-sick and ailing, and he falls frequently into the fire and frequently into the water,	ar quétala: “Heru, órava yondonyasse, an náse ránahlaiwa ar nimpa, an lantas rimbave mir i náre ar rimbave mir i nén,
and I brought him to your disciples, but they could not heal him!”	ar tallenyes hildolyannar, mal ualte polde nesta se!”
In answer Jesus said: “Unfaithful and twisted generation, how long is it necessary for me to remain with you? How long is it necessary for me to bear you? Bring him to me!”	Hanquentasse Yésus quente: “Úvoronda ar rícina nónare, manen andave mauya nin lemya aselde? Manen andave mauya nin cole le? Áse tala ninna!”
Then Jesus spoke firmly to it, and the demon came out of him, and the boy was healed from that hour.	Tá Yésus carampe tulcave senna, ar i rauco ettúle sello, ar i seldo náne nestana lúme yanallo.
Thereafter the disciples came privately to Jesus and said: “How is that we could not throw it out?”	Epeta i hildor túler vérave Yésunna ar quenter: “Manen ná in elme uar polde et-hatitas?”
He said to them: “Because of your small faith. For truly I say to you: If you have faith like a seed of mustard, you will say to this mountain: Move form here to there, and it will move, and nothing will be impossible to you. 	Quentes téna: “Pitya savieldanen. An násie quetin lenna: Qui samilde savie ve erde sinapio, quetuvalde oron sinanna: Leva silo tar, ar levuvas, ar munta nauva úcárima len. 
When they were gathered in Galilee Jesus said to them: “The Son of Man will be betrayed into the hands of men,	Íre anelte comyane Alileasse Yésus quente téna: “I Atanyondo nauva vartaina mannar atanion,
and they will kill him, and on the third day he will be raised!” Therefore they had deep grief.	ar nahtuvaltes, ar i nelya auresse nauvas ortana!” Etta sámelte lunga naire.
When they came to Capernaum, the men collecting the two dracmas came to Peter and said: “Does not your teacher pay the two dracmas?”	Íre túlelte Capernaumenna, i neri comyala i racma atta túler Péterenna ar quente: “Ma peantarelda ua paitya i racma atta?”
He said: “He does.” But when he went into the house, before he could speak, Jesus said: “What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of earth receive tax or tribute? From their sons or from foreigners?”	Quentes: “Caris.” Mal íre lendes mir i coa, nó polles quete, Yésus quente: “Mana sanal, Símon? Ho man cemeno arani camir tungwe hya rantie? Yondoltallon hya etteleallon?”
When he said: “From the foreigners,” Jesus said to him: “Then the sons are indeed free.	Íre hé quente, “I etteleallon,” Yésus quente senna: “Tá i yondor é nar lére.
But that we will not make them angry, you go to the sea, throw a hook, and take the first fish coming up – and when you open its mouth, you will find a stater. Take that and give it to them for me and for you!”	Mal in uangwe caruva te rúşie, alye lelya i earenna, hata ampa, ar á mapa i minya lingwe tulila ama – ar íre latyal antorya, hiruval stater. Á mapa ta ar áten anta sa nin ar lyen!”
At that time the disciples came near to Jesus and said: “Who really is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?”	Lúme yanasse i hildor túler hare Yésunna ar quenter: “Man nanwave ná i antúra menelo araniesse?”
And after he called a small child to himself, he caused it to stand in the middle	Ar apa yaldes pitya hína insenna, se-tyarnes tare i endesse
and said: “Truly I say to you: If you do not find repentance and are like small children, you will by no means come into the kingdom of heaven.	ar quente: “Násie quetin lenna: Qui ualde hire inwis ar nar ve pitye híni, laume tuluvalde mir menelo aranie.
Therefore, anyone who makes himself lowly like this chind, he is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven;	Etta, aiquen ye care inse nalda ve hína sina, isse ná i antúra menelo araniesse;
and anyone who receives a single such child in my name, receives me.	ar aiquen ye came erya taite hína essenyanen, came ní.
But anyone who causes to fall one among these who believe in me – to him it is more beneficial if a millstone was put around his neck, and he was drowned in the deep sea.	Mal aiquen ye tyare lanta er mici sine i savir nisse – sen nauva ambe aşea qui mulondo náne panyana os yahtya, ar anes quórina mí núra ear.
Woe to the world for its temptations! For the temptations will by necessity come, but woe to the man by whom the temptation comes!	Horro i marden úsahtieryain! An i úsahtier maurenen tuluvar, man horro i atanen yenen i úsahtie tule!
But if your hand or your foot is causing your fall, cut it off and throw it from you! To go lame or maimed into life is to you better than being thrown having two hands or two feet into the eternal fire!	Mal qui málya hya talelya tyára lantelya, ása aucire ar hata sa lyello! Mene lalevíte hya tapta mir coivie ná lyen arya epe náve hátina arwa má atto hya tál atto mir i oira náre!
And if your eye is causing your fall, tear it out and throw it from you! To go into life having a single eye is to you better than being thrown having two eyes into the fiery Gehenna!	Ar qui hendelya tyára lantelya, ása narca ettenna ar hata sa lyello! Mene mir coivie arwa erya hendo ná lyen arya epe náve hátina arwa hen atto mir i uruite Ehenna!
See that you do not despise anyone among these little ones! For I say to you that their angels in heaven always look at my heavenly Father's face.	Cena in ualde nattire aiquen mici pityar sine! An quetin lenna i valaltar menelde illume yétar meneldea Atarinyo cendele.
For the Son of Man has come to save that which was lost.	An i Atanyondo utúlie rehtien ya náne vanwa.
What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep, and one among them strays, does he not go away from the ninti-nine on the mountains, and he goes to seek the straying sheep?	Mana sanalde? Qui nér same mámar tuxa, ar er mici te ranya, ma uas auta ho i nerte neterquean i orontissen, ar menis cestien i ranyala máma?
And if he does find it – truly I say to you, about that shep he has a joy greater than which he has about the ninety-nine that have not strayed.	Ar qui é hirises – násie quétan lenna, pa máma tana samis alasse túra epe ya samis pa i nerte neterquean i uar aránie.
In the same manner, my heavenly Father's will is not that a single among these little ones will be lost.	Mi imya lé, meneldea Atarinyo indóme ua in erya mici pityar sine nauva vanwa.
Furthermore, if your brother sins, go and rebuke him between you and he alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother.	Ente, qui hánolya úcare, mena ar áse naitya imbe lyé ar sé erinque. Qui lastas lyenna, eñétiel hánolya.
But if he does not listen, bring with you one or two others, for by the mouth of two or three witnesses every affair shall be established.	Mal qui uas lasta, á tala aselye er hya atta ambe, an i antonen astarmor atto hya neldeo ilya natto nauva tulcana.
If he does not listen to them , speak to the congregation. If he fails to listen to the congregation as well, he is to be to you as a person of the nations or as a tax collector.	Qui uas lasta túna, queta i ocombenna. Qui loitas lasta yú i ocombenna, nauvas lyen ve quén i nórion ar ve tungwemo.
Truly I say to you, everything that you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and everything that you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.	Násie quetin lenna, ilqua ya nutilde cemende nauva nútina menelde, ar ilqua ya lehtalde cemende nauva lehtana menelde.
Again I truly say to you: If two among you are of one mind on earth to request something, that will happen for them by my heavenly Father. For where two or thre are gathered in my name, there I am in their midst.	Ata násie quetin lenna: Qui atta mici le nát er sámo cemende arcien nat, ta martuva tunt meneldea Atarinyanen. An yasse atta hya nelde nar comyane mi essenya, tasse ean endaltasse.
Then Peter came and said to them: “Lord, what is number of times when my brother may sin against me and I am to forgive him? As far as seven times?” Jesus said to him: “I say to you, not as far as seven times, but as far as seventy times seven!	Tá Péter túle ar quente senna: “Heru, mana nóte i lúron yassen hánonya lerta úcare ninna ar apsenuvan sen? Tenna lúr otso?” Yésus quente senna: “Quétan lyenna, lá tenna lúr otso, mal tenna otoquean lúr otso!
Therefore the kingdom of heaven is like a man, a king, who wished to have a reckoning with his thralls.	Etta menelo aranie ná ve nér, aran, ye merne same onótie as móliryar.
When he started the reckoning, a person having a debt of ten thousand talents was brought to him.	Íre yestanes i onótie, qúen arwa rohto talention húmi quean náne tulyana senna.
Since he did not have enough to pay him, his lord commanded that one was to sell him, with his wife and his children, and everything that he had, in order to pay the debt.	Pan uas sáme fáre paitien sen, herurya canne i mo vacumne se, as verirya ar hínaryar, ar ilqua ya sámes, paitien i rohta.
Therefore the thrall fell down and bowed before him, saying: “Have patience with me , and I will pay back everything to you!”	Etta i mól lantane undu ar luhtane epe se, quétala: “Sama cóle nin, ar paityuvan nan ilqua lyen!”
Being touched to his heart, the lord of that thrall released him and forgave his debt.	Ápaina endaryanna, sana mólo heru lehtane se ar apsenne rohtarya.
But that slave went out and found a person of the other slaves, who had to him a debt of a hundred denarii. And seizing him, he began to choke him, saying: “Pay me your debt!”	Mal sana mól etelende ar hirne quén i hyane mólion, ye sáme sen rohta lenárion tuxa. Ar mápala se, yestanes quore se, quétala: “Ánin paitya rohtalya!”
Then the other slave fell down and made request of him, saying: “Have patience with me, and I will pay you!”	Tá i hyana mól lantane undu ar arcane senna, quétala: “Sama cóle nin, ar paityuvan lyen!”
But he did not want to, but he went and threw him into prison until he would pay his debt.	Mal uas merne, ono lendes ar hante hé mir mando tenna hé paityumne rohtarya.
Therefore, when the other slaves saw which happened, they had deep grief, and they went and told to their lord everything that had happened.	Etta, íre i hyane móli cenner ya martane, sámelte tumna naire, ar lendelte ar nyarner herultan ilqua ya martanelyane.
Then his lord summoned him and said to him: “Wicked slave, your entire debt I forgave you, when you asked of me!	Tá herurya tultane se ar quente senna: “Olca mól, quanda rohtalya apsennen lyen, íre arcanel ninna!
Would you not then do well if you as well would have mercy on the other slave who was with you, as I gave you mercy?”	Lau tá carumnel mai qui yú lyé oravumne i hyana mólesse ye enge aselye, ve inye antane lyen oravie?”
And being angry, his lord gave him over to the jailers, until he was going to pay his entire debt.	Ar nála rúşea, herurya antane se ollo i mandonturin, tenna paityumnes quanda rohtarya.
In the same manner my heavenly Father will also do to you if you do not everyone forgive his brother from your heart!”	Mí imya lé meneldea Atarinya yú caruva len qui ualde ilquen apsene hánoryan endaldallo!”
And after Jesus completed all these words he went away from Galilee and came to the regions of Judea, beyond the Jordan.	Ar apa Yésus telyane ilye quettar sine oantes Alileallo ar túler i ménannar Yúreo, Yordan pella.
And great crowds followed him, and he healed them there.	Ar hoe şangali hilyaner se, ar te-nestanes tasse.
And some Pharisees came to him to test him, saying: “May a man divorce his wife for every reason?”	Ar Farisali túler senna tyastien se, quétala: “Ma lerta nér lehta inse veriryallo ilya castanen?”
In answer he said: “Did you not read that who created them, from the beginning made them male and female	Hanquentasse eques: “Ma ualde hentane i ye ontane tu, i yestallo carne tu hanu yo ní
and said: For this reason a man will abandon his father and his mother and will stick to his wife, and they will be one flesh – ?	ar quente: Sina castanen nér autuva ataryallo ar amilleryallo ar himyuva verirya, ar nauvatte hráve er – ?
Thus they are no more two, but one flesh. Therefore, which God has put under one yoke, do not let man separate!”	Sie uatte ambe atta, mal hráve er. Etta, ya Eru apánie nu er yalta, áva lave atanen hyare!”
They said to him: “Then how is that Moses commanded that one is to give her a writing of divoce and is to put her away?”	Quentelte senna: “Tá manen ná i Móses canne i mo antauva sen tecie aumentaléva ar panyuva se oa?”
He said to them: “Because of your hard heart Moses allowed that you may divorce your wifes, but it was not so from the beginning.	Quentes téna: “Hranga endaldanen Móses láve i lertalde lehta inde verildallon, mal lá enge sie i yestallo.
And I say to you: Anyone who divorces his wife except because of fornication, and gets married to another, breaks marriage!”	Ar quetin lenna: Aiquen ye lehta immo veriryallo hequa úpuhtiénen, ar verya exenna, race vestale!”
The disciples said to him: “If it is so concerning husband and wife, marriage is not beneficial!”	I hildor quenter senna: “Qui ea sie pa veru yo veri, vestale ua aşea!”
He said to them: “All cannot receive the saying, but only that have the gift.	Quentes téna: “Illi uar pole came i quetie, mal rie i samir i anna.
For there are some eunuchs that were born so from their mother's womb, and there are some eunuchs that were made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs that have have made themselves eunuchs for the good of the kingdom of heaven. Let that can receive it, receive it!”	An ear vielórali i náner nóne sie amillelto mónallo, ar ear vielórali i náner cárine vielóre lo atani, ar ear vielórali i acárier inte vielóre menelo araniéno márien. Lava yen pole camitas, came sa!”
Then children were being brought to him, for him to put his hands on them and for him to pray for them, but the disciples rebuked them. 	Tá hínali náner talaine senna, panieryan máryat tesse ar hyamieryan tien, mal i hildor naityaner te.
But Jesus said: “Let the children come, and do not stop them from coming to me, for the kingdom of heaven is for suchlike ones!”	Mal Yésus quente: “Lava i hínin tule, ar ávate pusta tuliello ninna, an menelo aranie taitin ná!”
And he put his hands on them and went away from there.	Ar panyanes máryat tesse ar oante talo.
And behold, one came to him and said: “Teacher, what is the good that it is necessary for me to do, in order to receive eternal life?”	Ar yé! quén túle senna ar quente: “Peantar, mana i márie ya mauya nin care, camien oira coivie?”
He said to him: “How is that you are asking me about goodness? There exists one whois good. But if you want to go into life, keep the commandments!”	Quentes senna: “Manen ná i maquétal ní pa márie? Ea er ye mára ná. Mal qui meril mene mir coivie, á himya i axani!”
He said to him: “What are they?” Jesus answered: “You shall not kill, you shall not steal, you shall not speak a lying witness,	Quentes senna: “Mana nalte?” Yésus hanquente: “Ávalye nahta, ávalye pile, ávalye quete hurila vettie,
you shall give glory to your father and to your mother, and love your neighbour as yourself!”	alye anta alcar atarelyan ar amillelyan, ar mela armarolya ve imle!”
The young man said to him: “I have kept all these commandments; what do I still lack?”	I nessa nér quente senna: “Ihímien ilye axani sine; mana en penin?”
Jesus said to him: “If you want to be perfect, go and sell your goods and give them to the poor, and you will receive a treasure in heaven; then come and follow me!”	Yésus quente senna: “Qui meril náve ilvana, mena ar vaca armalyar ar átai anta i penyain, ar camuval harma menelde; tá tula ar áni hilya!”
When the young man heard that, he went away in grief, for he had numerous goods.	Íre i nessa nér hlasse ta, oantes nairesse, an sámes rimbe armali.
But Jesus said to his disciples: “Truly I say to you that it will be difficult for a rich person to come into the kingdom of heaven.	Mal Yésus quente hildoryannar: “Násie quétan lenna in urda nauva lára quenen tule mir menelo aranie.
Again I say to you: For a camel to go through a needle's eye is easier than coming into God's kingdom for a rich person.	Ata quétan lenna: Ulumpen menie ter nelmo assa ná ancárima epe tulie mir Eruo aranie lára quenen!”
When the disciples heart that, they wre filled with great wonder, saying: “Who can be saved?”	Íre i hildor hlasser ta, anelte quátine túra elmendanen, quétala: “Man pole náve rehtana?”
Looking at them, Jesus said: “To men it is impossible, but to God all things are possible!”	Yétala te, Yésus quente: “Atanin nas úcárima, mal Erun ilye nati nar cárime!”
Then Peter spoke, saying: “Behold, we have abandoned everything and have followed you. What, really, will there be for us?”	Tá Péter carampe, quétala: “Yé, ehehtielme ilqua ar ihílier lyé. Mana, nanwave, euva men?”
Jesus said to them: “Truly I say to you: In the resurrection, when the Son of Man shall sit down upon his glorious throne, you that have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging Israel's twelve tribes.	Yésus quente téna: “Násie quetin lenna: I enontiesse, íre i Atanyondo hamúva alcarinqua mahalmaryanna, elde i ihílier ni yú hamuvar mahalassen yunque, namila Israélo nossi yunque.
And everyone who has gone away from houses or brothers or sisters or fields by reason of my name, will receive many times more and will be heir to eternal life.	Ar ilquen ye oantie ho coar hya hánor hya néşar hya restar castanen essenyo, camuva rimbe lúli amba ar nauva aryon oira coiviéno.
But numerous ones that are first will be last, and the last, first.	Mal rimbali i nar minye nauvar métime, ar i métimar, minye.
For the kingdom of heaven is like a man, an householder, who went out early to find workers that he could pay for them to work in his garden of vines .	TATTAn menelo aranie ná ve nér, coantur, ye etelende arinyave hirien molindoli in poldes paitya molieltan tarwaryasse liantassion.
After making an agreement with the workers about one denarius for the day, he sent them into his garden.	Apa carie vére as i molindor pa er lenár i auren, mentanes te mir tarwarya.
He also went out around the third hour and saw some others stand without work in the market-place,	Etelendes yú os i neldea lúme ar cenne exeli tára pen molie mí mancalenóme,
and he said to them as well: “You as well, go into the garden, and I shall give you what is just!”	ar quentes yú téna: “Yú elde, á lelya mir i tarwa, ar antauvan len ya faila ná!”
And they went. Again he went out around the sixth and the ninth hour, and he did the same thing.	Ar lendelte. Ata lendes ettenna os i enquea ar i nertea lúme, ar carnes i imya nat.
But around the eleventh hour he went out and found some others standing, and he said to them: “How is that you are standing here the whole day without working?”	Mal os i minquea lúme lendes ettenna ar hirne exeli tára, ar quentes téna: “Manen ná i táralde sisse i quanda aure pen molie?”
They said to him: “Because nobody has made an agreement with us about working!” He said to them: “Go to the garden of vines, you as well!”	Quentelte senna: “Pan úquen acárie vére aselme pa molie!” Quentes téna: “Mena i tarwanna liantassion, yú elde!”
When evening came, the master of the garden said to his overseer: Call the workers and pay them their payment, from the last ones to the first ones!	Íre şinye túle, i tarwantur quente ortirnoryanna: Yala i molindor ar á paitya tien paityalelta, i métimallon i minyannar!
When the men of the eleventh hour came, everyone among them received a denarius.	Íre i minquea lúmeo neri túler, ilquen mici te camne lenár.
Therefore, when the first ones came, they supposed that they were going to receive more, but everyone among them also received one denarius.	Etta, íre i minyar túler, intyanelte i camumnelte amba, mal ilquen mici té yú camne er lenár.
After receiving it they grumbled against the garden-master	Apa camie sa nurrunelte i tarwanturenna
and said: These last ones have worked a single hour, and yet you give them the same that you give to us that have carried the burden of the day and the heat!	ar quenter: “Métimar sine omólier erya lúme, ananta antal tien i imya ya antal men i ocólier i aureo cólo ar i úre!”
But in answer to one among them he said: 'Fellow, I have done nothing unrighteous to you! You assented when I said that I was going to give you one denarius, no?	Mal hanquentasse quenenna mici te quentes: “Málo, acárien munta úfaila lyen! Şáquentel íre quenten in antauvanen lyen er lenár, lá?
Take what is yours and go! I want to give this this last one the same that I give to you.	Á mapa ya lyenya ná ar mena! Merin anta métima sinan i imya ya antan lyen.
May I not do what I want to my own things? Or is your eye wicked since I am good?Thus the last ones will be first, and the first ones last!”	Ma uan lerta care ya merin vére natinyain? Hya ma hendelya olca ná pan inye mane ná? Sie i métimar nauvar minye, ar i minyar métime!”
Now, before he went up to Jerusalem, Jesus led the twelve disciples to a private place and said to them:	Sí, nó lendes ama Yerúsalemenna, Yésus tulyane i hildor yunque véra nómenna ar quente téna:
“Behold! We will go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be given over to the chief priests and the scribes, and they will judge him worthy of death	“Yé! Lelyuvalme ama Yerúsalemenna, ar i Atanyondo nauva antana olla i hére airimoin ar i parmangolmoin, ar namuvaltes valda qualmeo
and will give him over to the nations, for them to behave towards him with scorn and for them to flay him and for them to crucify him, and on the third day he will be raised!”	ar antauvaltes olla i nórin, lengieltan senna yaiwenen ar riptieltan se ar tarwestieltan se, ar i neldea auresse nauvas ortana!”
Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to him with her sons, bowing before him and requesting something of him.	Tá Severaio yondoron amil túle senna as yondoryar, luhtala epe se ar arcala nat sello.
Jesus said to her: “What do you want?” She said to him: “Say that these two sons of mine will sit, one by your right hand and one by your left hand, in your kingdom!”	Yésus quente senna: “Mana meril?” Isse quente senna: “Queta i yondonya atta sine haruvat, quén ara formalya ar quén ara hyarmalya, aranielyasse!”
In answer Jesus said: “You do not know what you request! Are you able to drink the cup that I will drink?” They said to him: “We are able!”	Hanquentasse Yésus quente: “Uaste ista ya arcaste! Ma lét polit suce i yulma ya inye sucuva?” Quentette senna: “Polimme!”
He said to them: “You will indeed drink my cup, but sitting by my right hand and my left hand is not a gift I may give; that is for those that are prepared by my Father!”	Quentes túna: “É sucuvaste yulmanya, mal harie ara formanya ar hyarmanya ua anna inye lerta anta; ta ná in nar manwane lo Atarinya!”
When the ten others heard about this, they were angry with the two brothers.	Íre i exi quean hlasser pa si, anelte rúşie i háno attanna.
But Jesus called them to himself and said: “You know the rulers of the nations rule them, and their mighty ones have power over them.	Mal Yésus yalde te insenna ar quente: “Istalde i nórion turi turir tai, ar tauraltar samir túre or te.
But it is not so among you, but who wants to be great among you, for him it is necessary to be your slave	Mal ua ea sie mici elde, ono ye mere náve túra mici lé, sen mauya náve núrolda,
– like also the Son of Man did not come to be served, but in order to serve and to give his life as a ransom in exchange of many!”	– ve yú i Atanyondo ua túle náven veuyaina, mal vevien ar antaven cuilerya ve nanwere quaptalesse rimbaiva!”
Now, when they went out of Jericho a great crowd followed him.	Sí, íre lendelte et Yericollo hoa şanga hilyane se.
And behold! two blind men were sitting by the road. When they heard that Jesus was the person passing by, they cried saying: “Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!”	Ar yé! laceníte nér atta hámanet ara i malle. Íre hlassette i Yésus náne i quén lahtala, yámette quétala: “Heru, órava metse, Lavirion!”
But the crowd spoke firmly to them, for them to be silent; and yet they cried the more: “Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!”	Mal i şanga carampe túna tulcave, návettan quilde; ananta yámette i ambe: “Heru, órava metse, Lavirion!”
And Jesus stopped, called them and said: “What do you wish that I will do for you?”	Ar Yésus pustane, yalde tu ar quente: “Mana meriste i caruvan lent?”
They said to him: “Lord, may our eyes be opened!”	Quentette senna: “Heru, nai hendummat nauvat pantaine!”
Being touched to his heart, Jesus touched their eyes – and in the same moment it was possible for them to see, and they followed him.	Ápaina endaryanna, Yésus appane henduttat – ar mi yana lú ence tunt cene, ar hilyanettes.
When they came near to Jerusalem and came to Bethphage to the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent forth two disciples, saying to them: “Go into the city that lies before you, and quickly you will find a donkey bound, and a colt with it; loose them and lead them to me.	Íre túlelte hare Yerúsalemenna ar túler Vet-Fahenna i Orontenna Milloaldaron, tá Yésus etementane hildo atta, quétala túna: “Mena mir i osto ya caita epe tu, ar lintave hiruvaste pellope nútina, ar rocolle óse; átu lehta ar átu tulya ninna.
And if somebody says anything to you, say: The Lord has need of them . Then, in the same moment, he will send them!”	Ar qui quén quete aiqua lenta, queta: I Heru same maure túva. Tá, mi imya lú, mentauvas tu!”
This thing happened to make true the word which the prophet spoke:	Nat sina martane carien anwa i quetta ya i Erutercáno quente:
“Tell the daughter of Zion: Behold, your king is coming to you, lowly and sitting on a donkey and on a cold, offspring of a beast of burden!”	“Nyara Siono selyen: Yé, aranelya túla lyenna, nalda ar hámala pellopesse, ar rocollesse, onna celvo cólova!”
Thus the disciples went and did as Jesus commanded them.	Sie i hildor lender ar carner ve Yésus canne tun.
And they brought the donkey and its colt, and they put on them their cloaks, and he sat upon them.	Ar tulunette i pellope ar rocollerya, ar panyanette tusse collattar, ar hamnes tusse.
The greater part of the crown spread out their cloaks on the road, while others cut off branches from the trees and spread them out in the road.	I ambe hoa ranta i şango pantaner collaltar i mallesse, íre exeli hocirner olvali i aldallon ar pantaner tai i mallesse.
And the crowds that went before him and the ones that followed cried: “Hosanna for the son of David! Blessed is who is coming in the Lord's name! Hosanna in the highest places!”	Ar i şangar yar lender epe se ar i hilyaner yámer: “Hosanna yondon Laviro! Aistana ná ye túla i Heruo essenen! Hosanna i tarmenissen!”
And when he went into Jerusalem, the entire city was exited, saying: “Who is this person?”	Ar íre lendes mir Yerúsalem, i quanda osto náne valtana, quétala: “Man ná quen sina?”
But the crowds answered: “This is Jesus the Prophet, from Nazareth in Galilee!”	Mal i şangar hanquenter: “Si ná Yésus i Erutercáno, Nasaretello Alileasse!”
And Jesus went into the temple, and he threw out all that sold and bought in the temple, and the tables of the money-changers he overturned, and the chairs of that sold the doves.	Ar Yésus lende mir i corda, ar et-hantes ilye i vancer ar homancaner i cordasse, ar sarnor i telpevistandoiva nuquernes, ar i hammar iva vancer i cucuar.
And he said to them: “It is written: My house will be called a house of prayer – but you have made it a cave of robbers!”	Ar quentes téna: “Ná técina: Coanya nauva estaina coa hyamiéva – mal elde acárier sa rotto piluiva!”
Furthermore, blind and lame people came to him in the temple, and he healed them.	Ente, laceníti ar lalevíti queneli túler senna i cordasse, ar nestanes te.
When the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonders that he did and the boys crying in the temple: “Hosianna to the Son of David,” they were angry	Íre i hére airimor ar i parmangolmor cenner i elmendar yar carnes ar i seldor yámala i cordasse: “Hosianna Yondon Laviro!”, anelte rúşie
and said to him: “Are you hearing what they are saying?” Jesus said to them: “Yes! Did you not ever read this: From the mouth of babes and babies you have prepared praise – ?	ar quenter senna: “Ma hláral ya té quétar?” Yésus quente téna: “Ná! Ma ualde oi hentane si: Et antollo lapsion ar vinimoron amanwiel laitale – ?”
And he went away from them and went out of the city and remained there through the night.	Ar oantes tello ar lende et i ostollo Vetanianna ar lemne tasse ter i lóme.
Returning to the temple early, he was hungry.	Nanwénala i cordanna arinyave, anes maita.
And he saw a fig tree beside the road and went to it, but he found nothing on it except only some leaves, and he said to it: “May nobody ever receive fruit from you!” And in the same moment the fig tree withered.	Ar cennes relyávalda ara i malle ar lende senna, mal hirnes munta sesse hequa rie lasseli, ar quentes senna: “Nai úquen oi camuva yáve lyello!” Ar mi imya lú i relyávalda hestane.
But when the disciples saw that, they were in wonder, saying: “How did the fig tree wither in a single moment?”	Mal íre i hildor cenner ta, anelte elmendasse, quétala: “Manen i relyávalda hestane mi erya lú?”
In answer Jesus said to them: “Truly I say to you: If you have faith and are not uncertain, you will not do only what I did to the fig tree, but also if you say to this mountain: Be lifted and thrown into the sea!, that will happen.	Hanquentasse Yésus quente téna: “Násie quetin lenna: Qui samilde savie ar uar iltance, ualde rie caruva ya inye carne i relyávaldan, mal yú qui quetilde oron sinanna: Na ortana ar hátina mir i ear!, ta martuva.
And all the things that you request in prayer, having faith, you will receive!”	Ar ilye i nati yar arcalde hyamiesse, arwe saviéno, camuvalde!”
Now after he went into the temple, the chief priests and the elders among the people came to him while he was teaching the crowd and said: “What is the authority by which you do these things? And who gave you this authority?”	Sí apa lendes mir i corda, i hére airimor ar i amyárar imíca i lie túler senna íre peantanes i şanga ar quenter: “Mana i hére yanen caril nati sine? Ar man antane lyen hére sina?”
In answer Jesus said to them: “I as well will ask you about one thing. If you tell me, I too will tell you about the authority with which I do these things.	Hanquentesse Yésus quente téna: “Yú inye maquetuva lenna pa er nat. Qui nyarilde nin, yú inye nyaruva len pa i hére yanen carin nati sine.
John's baptism, where was it from? From heaven or from men?” But they made a consideration among themselves, saying: “If we say: From heaven, he will say to us: Then how is that you did not believe in him?	Yoháno sumbie, mallo anes? Menello hya atanillon?” Mal carnelte úvie mici inte, quétala: “Qui quetilve: Menello, quetuvas venna: Tá manen ná i ualde sáve sesse?
But if we say: From men, we will fear the crowd, for all mong them beliee that John was a prophet!”	Mal qui quetilve: Atanillon, rucuvalve i şangallo, an illi mici te savir i Yoháno náne Erutercáno!”
And in answer they said to Jesus: “We do not know!” He as well said to them: “Then I alike do not tell you about the authority with which I do these things!”	Ar hanquentasse quentelte Yésunna: “Ualme ista!” Yú isse quente téna: “Tá inye véla ua nyare len pa i hére yanen carin nati sine.
But what do you think? was a man with two children. He went to the first one and said: Child, today work in the garden of wines!	Mal mana sanalde? Enge nér as hína atta. Lendes i minyanna ar quente: Hína, síra mola i tarwasse liantassion!
He said: I am going, lord! – but he did not go.	Hé quente: Ménan, heru! – mal uas lende.
Going to the other, he said the same thing. But in answer he said: I do not want to. But afterwards he changed his mind and went.	Lelyala i exenna, quentes i imya nat. Mal hanquentasse hé quente: Uan mere. Ono epeta vistanes sámarya ar lende.
Who among the two did the father's will?” They said: “The second one!” Jesus said to them: “Truly I say to you: The tax collectors and the harlots go before you into God's kingdom.	Man imíca i atta carne i ataro nirme?” Quentelte: “I attea!” Yésus quente téna: “Násie quetin lenna: I tungwemor ar i imbacindi lelyar epe lé mir Eruo aranie.
For John came to you in the way of righteousness, but you did not believe in him. But the tax collectors and the harlots believed in him, and you, though you saw that, did not afterwards change your mind so as to believe in him.	An Yoháno túle lenna mí malle failiéva, mal ualde sáver sesse. Mal i tungwemor ar i imbacindi sáver sesse, ar elde, ómu cennelde ta, uar epeta vistane sámalda savien sesse.
Hear another comparison: There was a man, a householder, who planted a garden of vines , surrounded it with a fence, dug a wine-press and built a tower. Then he let some cultivators use it for money, and went to foreign country.	Hlara hyana sestie: Enge nér, coantur, ye empanne tarwa liantassion, pelde sa pelonen, sampe limpevorma ar carastane mindo. Tá láves alamólin yuhta sa telpen, ar lende ettelea nórenna.
When the time of fruits came, he sent his servants to get his fruits.	Íre i lúme yáviva túle, mentanes núroryar ñetien yáveryar.
But the cultivators took his servants, and one they beat up, another they slew, on another they threw stones until he died.	Mal i alamor namper núroryar, ar er palpanelte, exe nacantelte, exenna hantelte sarni tenna qualles.
Again he sent other servants, more numerous than the first ones, but they did the same to them.	Ata mentanes hyane núroli, rimbe epe i minyar, mal carnelte i imya tien.
In the end he sent his son to them, saying: “They will have awe for my son!”	I mettasse mentanes yondorya téna, quétala: “Samuvalte áya yondonyan!”
Seeing the son, the cultivators said among themselves: “This is the heir; come, let us kill him and get his inheritance!”	Cénala i yondo, i alamor quenter mici inte: “Si i aryon ná; tula, alve nahta se ar ñete aryonierya!”
And seizing him, they threw him out of the garden and killed him.	Ar mápala se, hanteltes et i tarwallo ar nacanter se.
Therefore, when the garden-master shall come, what will he do to these cultivators?”	Etta, íre i tarwantur tuluva, mana caruvas sine alamoin?”
They said: “To these evil ones he will give an evil end, and he will let other cultivators use the garden, that will give him the fruits when the time has come!”	Quentelte: “Sine ulcain antauvas ulca metta, ar lavuvas hyane alamoin yuhta i tarwa, i antauvar sen i yávi íre i lúme utúlie!”
Jesus said to them: “Have you really not read in the scriptures: The rock which the builders turned away, it has become head of the corner. From the Lord this has come, and it is a wonder in our eyes – ?	Yésus quente téna: “Lau hentanelde i tehtelessen: I ondo ya i şamnor querner oa, sá olólie cas i vinco. I Hérullo si utúlie, ar nas elmenda hendulmatse – ?
Therefore I say to you: The Kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a nation making its fruits.	Etta quetin lenna: Eruo aranie nauva mapana oa lello ar antana nóren cárala yáveryar.
And who falls upon this rock will be broken, but whoever it falls upon – it will completely break him asunder.	Ar ye lanta ondo sinanna nauva rácina; mal aiquen yenna lantas – aqua ascatuvas se.
And when the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his comparisons, they knew that he spoke about them,	Ar íre i hére airimor ar i Farisar hlasser sestieryar, sintelte i quentes pa té,
and though they sought to seize him they feared the crowd, since they thought of him as a prophet.	ar ómu cestanelte mapa se runcelte i şangallo, pan sannelte pa se ve Erutercáno.
And in answer Jesus again spoke to them in comparisons, saying:	Ar hanquentasse Yésus ata carampe téna sestielissen, quétala:
“The kingdom of heaven is like a man, a king, who made a feast of marriage for his son.	“Menelo aranie ná ve nér, aran, ye carne veryangweo meren yondoryan.
And he sent his servants to call those that were called to the feast of marriage, but they did not want to come.	Ar mentanes núroryar yalien i náner yáline i veryangweo merendenna, mal ualte merne tule.
Again he sent other servants, saying: Tell the ones invited: 'Behold, I have prepared my meal, my bulls and my fattened animals have been slaughtered, and everything is ready! Come to the feast of marriage!'	Ata mentanes hyane núroli, quétala: Nyara i yálinain: 'Yé, amanwien mattinya, mundonyar ar maitane celvanyar anaier nahtane, ar ilqua manwa ná! Tula i veryangweo merendenna!'
But they did not give heed and went off, one to his own field, one to his business;	Mal ualte cimne ar oanter, quén véra restaryanna, quén mancaleryanna;
but the others, seizing his servants, behaved towards them with scorn and killed them.	mal i exi, mápala núroryar, lenganer tien yaiwenen ar nacanter te.
But the king became angry, and he sent his armies and destroyed those murderers and burnt their city.	Mal i aran olle rúşea, ar mentanes hosseryar ar nancarne tane nahtari ar urtane ostolta.
Then he said to his servants: The feast of marriage is indeed ready, but the ones called were not worthy.	Tá quentes núroryannar: I veryangweo meren é manwa ná, mal i yálinar úner valde.
Therefore go to the roads that lead out of the city, and call anyone that you find to the feast of marriage.	Etta mena i mallennar yar tulyar et i ostollo, ar yala aiquen ye hirilde i veryangweo merendenna.
And these servants went out and gathered all that they found, wicked ones and good ones alike, and the room in which they made the feast of marriage was filled by those that lay at the table.	Ar núror sine etelender ar comyaner illi i hirnelte, olcar ar mani véla, ar i şambe yasse carnelte i veryangweo meren náne quátina inen cainer ara i sarno.
When the king came in to look at the ones lying at the table, he saw a man who was not adorned in clothes of marriage.	Íre i aran túle minna yétien i caitalar ara i sarno, cennes nér ye úne netyana lanninen veryangweo.
And he said to him: “Friend, how did you come in here without clothes of marriage?” He had nothing that he could say.	Ar quentes senna: “Málo, manen túlel minna sir ú lannion veryangweo?” Sámes munta ya poldes quete.
Then the king said to his servants: Bind him on feet and hands and throw him out into the darkness on the outside; there will be the wailing and the grinding of teeth.'	Tá i aran quente núroryannar: 'Áse nute talusse ar mátse ar áse et-hate mir i mornie i ettesse; tasse nauvar i yaime ar i mulie nelciva.'
For numerous ones are called, but few are chosen!”	An rimbar nar yáline, mal mancar nar cíline!
Then the Pharisees went and made plans together, to trap him in his speech.	Tá i Farisar lender ar carner panoli uo, rembien se questaryasse.
And they sent to him their disciples with the Herodians, that said: “Teacher, we know that you are true and teach God's way in truth, and you do not give heed to anyone , for you do not look at the face of Men.	Ar mentanelte senna hildoltar as i Herolyar, i quenter: “Peantar, istalme i nalye nanwa ar peanta Eruo malle nanwiesse, ar ualye cime aiquen, an ual yéta Atanion cendele.
Therefore say to us what you think: Is it allowed to give tax to the High King, or not?	Etta queta menna ya sanalye: Ma ná lávaina anta tungwe i Ingaranen, hya lá?”
But Jesus, knowing their evil, said: “How is that you test me, hypocrites?	Mal Yésus, istala ulculta, quente: “Manen ná i tyastalde ni, imnetyandor?
Show me a silver-piece of the tax!” They brought to him a denarius. And he said to them: “Whose picture and writing is this?”	Ánin tana telpemitta i tungweo!” Tulunelte senna lenár. Ar quentes téna: “Mano emma ar tecie ná si?”
They said: “The High King's!” Then he said to them: “Therefore pay the High King's things to the High King, but God's things to God!”	Quentelte: “I Ingarano!” Tá quentes téna: “Etta á paitya i Ingarano nati i Ingaranen, mal Eruo nati Erun!”
And when they heard that, they were in wonder, and going away from him they went off.	Ar íre hlasselte ta, anelte elmendasse, ar autala sello lendelte oa.
In that day came to him some Sadducees, that say that is no resurrection, and they asked him:	Yana auresse túler senna Sanduceáli, i quetir i lá ea enortie, ar maquentelte senna:
“Teacher, Moses said: If anyone dies without children, it is necessary for his brother to marry his wife and raise up seed to his brother.	“Peantar, Móses quente: Qui aiquen quale ú hínion, mauya hánoryan verya veriryanna ar orta erde hánoryan.
 were with us seven brothers, and the first, after he got married to a woman, died; and since he lacked child, he left his wife for his brother.	Enger aselte hánor otso, ar i minya, apa veryanes nissenna, qualle; ar pan pennes hína, hehtanes verirya hánoryan.
The same thing happened also to the second and to the third, indeed until the seventh.	I imya nat martane yú i attean ar i neldean, é tenna i ostean.
As the last the woman died.	Ve i métima i nís qualle.
Then who will have her as wife in the resurrection? For all among them had her!”	Tá man se-samuvas ve veri i enortiesse? An illi mici te sámer se!”
In answer Jesus said to them: “You err, since you do not know the Scriptures and God's power alike.	Hanquentasse Yésus quente téna: “Loitalde, pan ualde ista i Tehteler ar Eruo túre véla.
For in the resurrection they do not get married to others or are married off, but they are like the angels of heaven.	An i enortiesse ualte verya exennar hya nar vertane, mal nalte ve menelo vali.
But concerning the resurrection of the dead, did you not read what was said to you by God, when he said:	Mal pa i enortie qualinaron, ma ualte hentane ya náne quétina lenna lo Eru, íre quentes:
I Abraham's God and Isaac's God and Jacob's God – ? He is not the God of dead ones, but of living ones!”	Inye Avrahámo Aino ar Ísaco Aino ar Yácovo Aino – ? Uas qualinaron Aino, mal coirearon!”
Hearing that, the crowds were filled with wonder at his teaching.	Hlárala ta, i şangar náner quátine elmendanen peantieryanen.
When the Pharisees heard how he stopped the mouth of the Sadducees, they gathered together.	Íre i Farisar hlasser manen pustanes anto i Sandúcearon, ocomnelte uo.
And one among them, a lawyer, asked to test him:	Ar quén imíca te, şanyengolmo, maquente tyastien se:
“Teacher, what is the greatest commandment in the Law?”	“Peantar, mana i antúra axan i Şanyesse?”
He said to him: “'You shall love the Lord your God with your whole heart and your whole soul and your whole mind.'	Quentes senna: “Alye mele i Héru Ainolya quanda endalyanen ar quanda fealyanen ar quanda sámalyanen.
That is the greatest and first commandment.	Ta ná i antúra ar minya axan.
The second one is similar: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.	I attea vávea ná: Alye mele armarolya ve imle.
These are the two commandments by which the entire Law hangs, and the Prophets!”	Sine nát i axan atta yanten i quanda Şanye linga, ar i Erutercánor!”
Now while the Pharisees were gathered Jesus said to them:	Sí lan i Farisar aner comyane Yésus maquente téna:
“What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?” They said to him: “David's!”	“Mana sanalde pa i Hristo? Mano yondo náse?” Quentelte senna: “Laviro!”
He said to them: “How, then, may David by the Spirit call him Lord, saying:	Quentes téna: “Manen, tá, lerta Lavir i Fairenen esta se Heru, quétala:
The Lord said to my lord: Sit by my right hand until I place your enemies under your feet'– ?	I Héru quente herunyanna: Hara ara formanya tenna panyan ñottolyar nu talulyat – ?
If, then, David calls him Lord, how is he his son?”	Qui, tá, Lavir esta se Heru, manen náse yondorya?”
And nobody was able to say to him a single word; furthermore, was not anyone who dared to ask him more.	Ar ence úquenen hanquete senna erya quetta; ente, lá enge aiquen ye veryane maquete senna ambe.
Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to the disciples, saying:	Tá Yésus carampe i şangannar ar i hildonnar, quétala:
“The scribes and the Pharisees are sitting on the chair of Moses.	“I parmangolmor ar Farisar hárar Móseo hammasse.
Therefore do and keep all the things that they tell you, but to do do according to their deeds, for they say it, but do not perform.	Etta á care ar himya ilye i nati yar nyarilte len, mal áva care ve cardaltar, an quetiltes, mal uar care.
They bind heavy burdens and put them on people's back, but they do not wish to touch them with their finger.	Nutilte lunge cólar ar panyar tai quenion pontesse, mal té uar mere appa tai lepereltanen.
All their doings they do in order to be seen by men, for they make their phylacteries broad and their fringes broad.	Ilye carieltar carilte náven cénine lo atani, an carilte colcalleltar palle ar laniltar hoe.
They love to have the most prominent places at meals and the first seats in the synagogues,	Melilte same i amminde nómi mattissen ar i minye hammar i yomencoassen,
and to receive greetings in the market-places and to be called Rabbi by men.	ar came suilier i mancalenómessen ar náve estaina Ravi lo atani.
But you, do not allow anyone to call you Rabbi, for one is your teacher, but all among you are brothers.	Mal elde, áva lave aiquenen esta le Ravi, an er ná peantarelda, mal illi mici lé nar hánor.
Furthermore, do not call anyone on earth your father, for you have a single Father, the heavenly one.	Ente, áva esta aiquen cemende atarelda, an samilde erya Atar, i meneldea.
And do not be called leaders, for you have a single Leader, the Christ.	Ar áva na estaine tulyandor, an samilde erya Tulyando, i Hristo.
But for who is the greatest among you it is necessary to be your servant.	Mal yen ná i antúra mici le mauya náve núrolda.
 who exalts himself will be humbled, and that humbles himself will be exalted.	Ye orta inse nauva nucumna, ar ye nucumne inse nauva ortaina.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you close God's kingdom before Men, for you do not go inside, and that go inside you stop! 	Horro len, parmangolmor ar Farisar, imnetyandor! An holtalde Eruo aranie epe Atani, an elde uar lelya minna, ar i lelyar minna pustalde! 
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you travel across sea and land to turn a single person to your faith, and when he has received it, you make him worthy of Gehenna two times more than you.	Horro len, parmangolmor ar Farisar, imnetyandor! An lelyalde olla ear yo nor querien erya quén savieldanna, ar íre acámies sa, carildes valda Ehennan lú atta ambe epe lé.
Woe to you, blind leaders, that say: 'If anyone gives his oath by the temple, that is nothing, but if anyone gives his oath by the gold of the temple, he is obliged.'	Horro len, cénelóre tulyandor, i quetir: 'Qui aiquen anta vandarya i cordanen, ta ná munta, mal qui aiquen anta vandarya i cordo maltanen, náse nauta.'
Fools and blind ones! For what is the greater, the gold or the temple that hallows the gold?	Aucor ar cénelórar! An mana i ambe túra, i malta hya i corda ya airita i malta?
Also you say: 'If anyone gives his oath by the altar, that is nothing, but if anyone gives his oath by the gift on it, he is obliged.'	Yando quetilde: 'Qui aiquen anta vandarya i yangwanen, ta ná munta; mal qui aiquen anta vandarya i annanen sasse, náse nauta.'
Blind ones! For what is the greater, the gift or the altar that hallows the gift?	Cénelórar! An mana i ambe tura, i anna hya i yangwa ya airita i anna?
Therefore who gives his oath by the altar does so by it and by all the things on it,	Etta ye anta vandarya i yangwanen care sie sánen ar ilye i natinen sasse,
and who gives his oath by the temple does so by it and by he that dwells in it,	ar ye anta vandarya i cordanen care sie sánen ar sénen ye mare sasse,
and who gives his oath by heaven does so by God's throne and by who is sitting on it!	ar ye anta vandarya menelden care sie Eruo mahalmanen ar yenen hára sasse!
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you give the tenth of i mint and the dill and the cumin, but you have abandoned the more important things in the Law: justice and mercy and faithfulness. It was necessary to do these things, and yet not abandon the others.	Horro len, parmagolmor ar Farisar, imnetyandor! An antalde i quaista i minto ar i lillo ar i cúmino, mal ehehtielde i ambe valdie nati i Şanyesse: failie ar óravie ar voronwie. Mauyane care nati sine, ananta lá hehta i exi.
Blind ones, that strain out the gnat , but devour the camel!	Cénelórar, i saltar i pí, mal ammatir i ulumpe!
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for you cleans outside of the cup and the dish, but on the inside they are full of plunder and lack of self-control.	Horro len, parmangolmor ar Farisar, imnetyandor, an poitalde ette i yulmo ar i veneo, mal i mityasse nalte quante pilweo ar peniéno immoturiéva.
Blind Pharisee, cleanse first the inside of the cup and the dish, for its outside to be clean as well!	Cénelóra Farisa, á poita minyave i mitya i yulmo ar i veneo, yando etteryo náven poica!
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for you are like whitened graves, which indeed seem beautiful on the outside, but on the inside they are full of bones of dead ones and every kind of uncleanness.	Horro len, parmangolmor ar Farisar, imnetyandor, an nalde ve ninquinte sapsar, yar é şéyar vanye i ettesse, mal i mityasse nalte quante axoinen qualinion ar ilya nostalénen úpoitiéva.
In that manner you as well on the outside seem just to men, but on the inside you are full of hypocricy and lawlessness.	Mi sana lé yando elde i ettesse nemir faile atanin, mal i mityasse nalde quante imnetyaleo ar şanyelóriéno.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for you build the graves of the Prophets and adorn the tombs of the just,	Horro len, parmangolmor ar Farisar, imnetyandor, an caraste i Erutercánoron sapsar ar netyar i failaron noiri,
and you say: “If we existed in our father's days, we did not have part with them in the blood of the Prophets!”	ar quetilde: “Qui engelve auressen atarilvaron, ualve sáme ranta aselte i Erutercánoron sercesse!”
Thus you witness against yourselves that you are sons of that killed the Prophets!	Sie vettalde indenna i nalde yondor ion nacanter i Erutercánor!
You too, then, fill your fathers' measure!	Yando elde, tá, quata atarildaron lesta!
Serpents, brood of worms, how will you escape from the judgment of Gehenna?	Leucar, vembion hín, manen uşuvalde Ehenno námiello?
Therefore, behold! I am sending to you prophets and wise ones and scribes. Some among them you will kill and you will crucify, and some among them you will flay in your synagogues and you will pursue them from city to city,	Etta, yé! inye mentea lenna Erutercánoli ar sailali ar parmangolmoli. Queneli mici te nahtuvalde ar tarwestuvalde, ar queneli mici te riptuvalde yomencoaldassen ar roituvaldet ostollo ostonna,
and so there will come upon you all righteous blood poured forth on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Barakiah, whom you slew between the sanctuary and the altar.	ar sie tuluva lenna ilya faila serce etulyana cemende, sercello faila Avelo sercenna Sacarío Varaciaion, ye nacantelde imbi i yána ar i yangwa.
Truly I say to you: All these things will come upon this generation!	Násie quetin lenna: Ilye nati sine tuluvar nónare sinanna!
Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that slays the prophets and stones those that are sent to her – how frequently I wished to gather your children, as a hen gathers her young under her wings ! But you did not want to.	Yerúsalem, Yerúsalem, ye nahta i Erutercánor ar sarya i nar mentaine senna – manen rimbave mernen comya hínalyar, ve poroce comya nessaryar nu rámaryat! Mal ualde merne.
Behold! Your house is left to you!	Yé! Coalda ná len hehtana!
And I say to you: From now you will not see me until you say: 'Blessed is he that is coming in the name of the Lord.'”	An quetin lenna: Ho sí ualde ni-cenuva tenna quetuvalde: Aistana ná ye túla i Héruo essenen!”
Leaving, Jesus went away, but his disciples came to him to show him the buildings of the temple.	Autala, Yesus lende oa, mal hildoryar túler senna tanien sen i cordo ataqui.
In answer he said to them: “Do you not see all these things? Truly I say to you: Here a stone will by no means remain on a stone that will not be thrown down!”	Hanquentasse quentes téna: “Ma ualde cene ilye sine nati? Násie quetin lenna: Sisse ondo laume lemyuva to ondo ya ua nauva hátina undu!”
When he sat on the Mounts of Olives, the disciples came to him when they were alone, saying: “Tell us: What is the time when these things will happen, and what will be the sign of your return and the conclusion of the age?”	Íre hamnes Orontesse Milloaldaron, i hildor túler senna íre anelte erinque, quétala: “Nyara men: Mana i lúme yasse nati sine martuvar, ar mana nauva i tanwa entulesselyo ar i tyeldo i rando?”
In answer Jeuss said to them: “See that nobody causes you to err ,	Hanquentasse Yésus quente téna: “Á yéta in úquen tyare le ranya,
for numerous ones will come in my name, saying: 'I am the Christ!', and they will cause many to err.	an rimbali tuluvar essenyanen, quétala: 'Inye i Hristo ná!', ar tyaruvalte rimbali ranya.
You will hear about wars and will receive news of wars; take heed, that you are not terrified. By necessity it will happen, but the end still has not come.	Hlaruvalde pa ohtali ar camuvar sinyali ohtalion; cima in ualde ruhtane! Maurenen martuvas, mal i metta en ua utúlie.
For nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom, and will be famines and earthquakes in numerous places.	An nóre ortuva nórenna ar aranie aranienna, ar euvar saiceléli ar cempaliéli rimbe nómelissen.
All these things are a beginning of pains.	Ilye nati sine nar yesta naicelion.
Then people will give you over into tribulation and will kill you, and you will be hated by all the nations by reason of my name.	Tá queneli antauvar le olla mir şangie ar nahtuvar le, ar nauvalde tévaine lo ilye i nóri castanen essenyo.
And then numerous ones will fall away and will betray one another and will hate one another.	Ar tá rimbali lantuvar oa ar vartuvar quén i exe ar tevuvar quén i exe.
And many false prophets will arise and will cause many to err,	Ar rimbe hurutercánoli ortuvar ar tyaruvar rimbali ranya,
and since the lawlessness grows, love will become cold in the greater number of people.	ar pan i şanyelórie ale, melme oluva ringa i ambe rimbe quenissen.
But who endures until the end, he will be saved.	Mal ye perpere i mettanna, isse nauva rehtana.
And the gospel of the kingdom will be made known in the entire world as a witness for all the nations, and then the end will come.	Ar i evandilyon i araniéno nauva carna sinwa i quanda ambaresse ve vettie ilye i nórin, ar tá i metta tuluva.
Therefore, when you see the Disgusting Thing of Destruction, of which Daniel the Prophet spoke, standing in a holy place” – let who is reading understand –	Etta, íre cenilde i Faica Nat Nancariéva, pa ya Laniel i Erutercáno carampe, tárala aire nómesse” – lava yen hentea hanya –
“then it is necessary for who are in Judea escape to the mountains.	“tá mauya in nar Yureasse uşe i orontinnar.
A man on the roof is not to go down to bring his goods out of his house,	Nér i tópasse áva lelya undu talien armaryar et coaryallo,
and a man in the field is not to return to his house to pick up his cloak.	ar nér i restasse áva nanwene coaryanna leptien collarya.
Woe to the pregnant women and that suckle a baby in those days!	Horro i lapsarwain ar i tyetir vinimo ente auressen!
Pray that your flight will not happen in winter or on the sabbath,	Hyama i lercielda ua martuva hrívesse hya i sendaresse,
for then there will be a great tribulation, as has not happened from the beginning of the earth until now, and will not happen again.	an tá euva túra şangie, ve ua amartie i mardo yestallo tenna sí, ar ua martuva ata.
If those days were not shortened, there was not flesh being saved, but for the good for the chosen ones, those days will be shortened.	Qui ente auri úner nuhtane, ua enge hráve nála rehtana, mal i cílinaron márien, ente auri nauvar nuhtane.
Then, if anyone says to you: 'Look! Here is the Christ!', or 'There!', do not believe it .	Tá, qui aiquen quete lenna: 'Ela! Sisse ná i Hristo!', hya 'Tasse!', ávasa save.
For false Christs and false prophets will rise up and will give great signs and wonders, to cause also the chosen ones to stray, if that was possible.	An huruhristoli ar hurutercánoli ortuvar ar antauvar túre tanwali ar elmendali, tyarien yando i cílinar ranya, qui tá náne cárima.
Behold, I have told you beforehand.	Yé, len-anyárien nóvo.
Therefore, if people say to you: 'Behold! He is in the wilderness!', do not go thither. If they say: 'Behold, he is in the inner rooms!', do not believe it!	Etta, qui queni quetir lenna: 'Yé! Náse i erumasse!', áva lelya tar. Qui quetilte: 'Yé, náse i mitye şambessen!', ávasa save!
For as when the flash of thunder comes out from east and shines to west, so it will be at the coming of the Son of Man!	An ve i íta hundiéva ettule Rómello ar calta Númenna, sie euva i Atanyondo tulesse!
The place where the corpse is, there the eagles will gather!	I nóme yasse i quelet ea, tasse i şorni ocomuvar!
Soon after the tribulation in those days, the Sun will bcome dark, and the Moon will not give his sheen, and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of heaven will be being shaken.	Ron apa i şangie mi ente rí, Anar oluva morna, ar Işil ua antuva işilmerya, ar i tinwi lantuvar menello, ar menelo túri nauvar pálaine.
And then the sign of the Son of Man will be seen in heaven, and then all tribes of the earth will beat themselves in lamentation, and they shall see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven having power and much glory;	Ar tá i tanwa i Atanyondova nauva cénina menelde, ar tá ilye nossi cemeno palpuvar inte nainiesse, ar cenuvalte i Atanyondo túla menelo fanyassen arwa túreo ar olya alcaro;
and he will send his angels with a mighty trumpet-blast, and they will gather his chosen ones out of the four winds, from heaven's border to its other border.	ar mentauvas valaryar taura rómanen, ar comyauvalte cílinaryar et i súrillon canta, menelo rénallo hyana rénaryanna.
Now learn this comparison from the fig tree: When its branch becomes soft and it sprouts its leaves, you know that summer is near.	Sí para sestie sina i relyávaldanen: Íre olvarya ole musse ar tuias lasseryar, istalde i laire hare ná.
Thus you as well, when you see all these things, know that he is near, before the doors.	Sie yando elde, íre cenilde ilye nati sine, istar i náse hare, epe i fendi.
Truly I say to you that this generation shall by no means pass away before all these things happen.	Násie quetin lenna i laume autuva nónare sina nó ilye nati sine martar.
Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words will not pass away.	Menel cemenye autuvat, mal ninye quettar uar autuva.
Of that day and hour nobody knows, not the angels in heaven and not the Son, but the Father alone.	Pa ré ar lúme enta úquen ista, lá i vali menelde ar lá i Yondo, mal i Atar erinqua.
For as the days of Noah were, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.	An ve réryar Noaħ náner, sie euva mí Atanyondo tulesse.
For as they were in those days before the Flood, eating and drinking, marrying and being married off, until the day that Noah went into the ark;	An tambe anelte yane auressen nó i Oloire, matila ar sucila, veryala ar nála vertane, tenna i aure ya Noaħ lende mir i marcirya,
and they understood nothing until the Flood came and carried them off, so the coming of the Son of Man will be.	ar hanyanelte munta tenna i Oloire túle ar colde te illi oa, síve i Atanyondo tulesse euva.
Then two men shall be in one field: One will be brought and the other will be abandoned.	Tá nér atta euvat er restasse: Qúen nauva talana ar i exe nauva hehtana.
Two women will grind with the same mill; one will be brought and the other will be abandoned.	Nís atta muluvat i imya mulmanen: quén nauva talana ar i exe nauva hehtana.
Therefore be awake, for you do not know what day your Lord will come.	Etta na cuive, an ualde ista mi mana ré Herulda tuluva.
But know this: If the master of the house knew in what watch the thief will come, he was awake and did not allow anyone to break into his house.	Mal á ista si: Qui i coantur sinte mi mana tiresse i arpo tuluva, anes cuiva ar ua láve aiquenen race mir coarya.
Therefore you as well be ready, for the Son of Man will come in an hour when you do not think so.	Etta yando elde na manwe, an i Atanyondo tuluva mi lúme yasse ualde sana sie.
Who is the faithful and wise thrall whom his lord put over the people of his house, to give them food in the proper hour?	Man ná i voronda ar saila mól ye herurya panyane or coaryo queni, antaven tien matta i vanima lúmesse?
Happy is that thrall if his lord, when he comes, finds him doing so.	Valima ná mól tana qui herurya, íre hé tule, hire se cára sie.
Truly I say to you: He will put him over everything that he has.	Násie quetin lenna: Hé panyuva se or ilqua ya hé same.
But if that evil slave will say in his heart: 'My lord is late',	Mal qui tana ulca mól quetuva endaryasse: 'Herunya ná telwa',
and he will begin to beat the other slaves and drink with that fill themselves with wine,	ar yestuvas palpa i hyane móli ar sucuva as i quatir inte limpenen,
then the lord of that slave will come on a day that he does not foresee and in an hour that he does not know,	tá tana mólo heru tuluva auresse ya uas apacene ar lúmesse ya uas ista,
and he will punish him in a harsh manner and will give him the same end that the hypocrites receive. There will be his tears and his grinding of teeth.	ar se-paimetuvas naraca lénen ar antauva sen i imya metta ya i imnetyandor camir. Tasse euvar níreryar ar mulierya nelciva.
Then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten maidens that brought their lamps and went outside to meet the bridegroom.	Tá menelo aranie nauva ve vendi quean i taller calmaltar ar lender ettenna velien i ender.
Five among them were unwise, and five were wise.	Lempe mici te náner alasaile, ar lempe náner saile.
For the foolish ones took their lamps but did not bring oil with them,	An i aucar namper calmaltar mal uar talle millo aselte,
while the wise ones brought oil in their bottles with their lamps.	íre i sailar namper millo olpeltassen as calmaltar.
When the bridegroom was late, all among them were slumberous and slept.	Íre i ender náne telwa, illi mici té náner lorde ar húmer.
In the middle of the night was a cry: “Behold the bridegroom! Go to meet him!”	Endesse i lómio enge yáme: 'Yé i ender! Mena se-velien!'
Then all those maidens arose and prepared their lamps.	Tá ilye tane vendi oronter ar manwaner calmaltar.
The unwise ones said to the wise ones: 'Give us of out of your oil, for our lambs will soon be extinguished!”	I alasailar quenter i sailannar: 'Ámen anta et milloldo, an calmalmar ron nauvar luhtyane!'
The wise ones answered: 'Maybe the oil will not suffice for us and for you. Instead go and buy for yourselves!'	I sailar hanquenter: “Cé i millo ua faryuva men ar len. I mende mena ar á homanca elden!”
After they went away to buy, the bridegroom came, and the maidens that were ready went with him to the feast of marriage, and the door was closed.	Apa oantelte homancien, i ender túle, ar i vendi i náner manwe lende óse i merendenna veryangweo, ar i fenna náne holtana.
Afterwards the other maidens also came, saying: 'Lord, lord, open for us!'	Epeta i hyane vendi yando túler, quétala: 'Heru, heru, ámen latya!'
In answer he said: 'Truly I say to you, I do not know you!'	Hanquentasse eques: 'Násie quetin lenna, uan ista le!'
Therefore take heed, for you do not know the day or the hour.	Etta cima, an ualde ista i aure hya i lúme.
For the matter is like when a man who was going to travel to another country summoned his thralls and gave his goods into their keeping.	An i natto ná ve íre nér ye lelyumne hyana nórenna tultane mólyar ar antaner armaryar mir hepielta.
And to one among them he gave five talents, to another two, to another one – according to their skill. Then he went away.	Ar quenen mici te antanes talenti lempe, exen atta, exen er – ve fintielta. Tá lendes oa.
Quickly that received the five talents went away and traded with them, and he gained another five.	Lintiénen ye camne i talenti lempe lende oa ar mancane tainen, ar ñentes an lempe.
In the same manner who received the two gained another two.	Mí imya lé ye camne i atta ñente an atta.
But that received the one, went off and dug in the ground and hid the money of his lord.	Mal ye camne i er, oante ar sampe i talamesse ar nurtane i telpe heruryava.
After a long time the lord of those thralls came and had a reckoning with them.	Apa anda lúme i heru sane mólion túle ar sáme onótie aselte.
And coming forward, that received thmattme five talents brought another five talents, saying: “Lord, you gave five talents into my keeping. Behold, I have gained another five talents!”	Ar túlala ompa, ye camne i talenti lempe talle an talenti lempe, quétala: “Heru, antanel talenti lempe mir hepienya. Ela, eñétien an talenti lempe!”
His lord said to him: “Well done, good and faithful thrall! You were faithful over a few things. I will put you over many things. Come into the joy of your lord!”	Herurya quente senna: “Mai carna, mára ar voronda mól! Anel voronda or nótime natali. Panyuvan lye or rimbe natali. Tula mir herulyo alasse!”
Also who received the two talents came forward and said: “Lord, two talents you gave into my keeping. Behold, I have gained another two talents!”	Yú ye camne i talent atta túle ompa ar quente: “Heru, talent atta antanel mir hepienya. Ela, eñétiel an talent atta!”
His lord said to him: “Well, done, good and faithful thrall! You were faithful over a few things. I will put you over many things. Come into your the joy of your lord!”	Herurya quente senna: “Mai carna, mára ar voronda mól! Anel voronda or nótime natali. Panyuvan lye or rimbe natali. Tula mir herulyo alasse!”
In the end that received the one talent came forward and said: “Lord, I know that you are a harsh man, reaping where you did not sow and gathering where you did not scatter.	I mettasse ye camne i er talent túle ompa ar quente: “Heru, istan i nalye naraca nér, cirihtala yasse ual rende ar comyala yasse ual vintane.
Therefore I was terrified and went off and hid your talent in the ground. Here you have what is yours!”	Etta anen ruhtaina ar oante ar nurtane talentelya i talamesse. Sisse samil ya lyenya ná!”
In answer he said: “Wicked and dull thrall, then you knew that I reap where I did not sow and gather where I did not scatter?	Hanquentasse eques: “Olca ar lenca mól, tá sintel i cirihtan yasse uan rende ar comyan yasse uan vintane?
Therefore it was necessary for you to put my money with the bankers, and when I came I could receive what was mine with added money .	Etta mauyane lyen panya telpenya as i sarnomor, ar íre túlen ence nin came ya ninya né as napánina telpe!
Therefore you are to take the talent from him and give it to the one that has the ten talents!	Etta alde mapa i talent sello ar ása anta yen same i talenti quean!
For to everyone that has, more will be given and he will have abundance, but that does not have – also what he has will be taken from him!	An ilquenen ye same, amba nauva antana ar samuvas úve, mal ye ua same – yando ya samis nauva mapana sello!
And you are to throw the no-good thrall into the darkness on the outside! There will be his tears and his grinding of teeth.	Ar alde hate i alamára mól mir i mornie i ettesse! Tasse euvar níreryar ar molierya nelciva.
But when the Son of Man shall come in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit down on his glorious throne.	Mal íre i Atanyondo tuluva alcareryasse, ar ilye i vali óse, tá hamuvas undu alcarinqua mahalmaryasse.
And all the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate them one from the other, as when a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.	Ar ilye i nóri nauvar comyane epe se, ar te-ciltuvas quén i exello, ve íre mavar cilta i mámar i nyénillon.
And he will put his sheep at his right hand, but the goats at his left hand.	Ar panyuvas mámaryar ara formarya, mal i nyénir ara hyarmarya.
Then the king will say to that are standing to his right: 'Come, you who are blessed by my Father, possess the kingdom prepared for you from the founding of the world!	Tá i aran quetuva innar tárar foryaryasse: 'Tula, le i nar aistane lo Atarinya, á harya i aranie manwana len tulciello mardeva!
For I was hungry and you gave he food; I was thirsty, and you gave me something to drink; I was a stranger, and you received me,	An anen maita ar antanelde nin matta; anen soica, ar antanelde nin nat sucien; anen ettelea ar camnelde ni,
naked, and you covered me. I was sick and you cared for me, I was in prison and you came to me.'	helda, ar tumpelde ni. Anen hlaiwa ar cimbanelde ni, anen mandosse ar túlelde ninna.'
Then the just ones will answer him so: 'Lord, what the time that we saw you hungry and gave you food, or thisty, and gave you something to drink?	Tá i failar hanquetuvar senna sie: 'Heru, mana i lú ya cennelme lye maita ar antaner lyen matta, hya soica, ar antane lyen nat sucien?
What the time that we saw you as a foreign person and received you, or naked, and covered you?	Mana i lú ya cennelme lye ve ettelea quén ar camner lye, hya helda, ar tumper lye?
What the time that we saw you sick or in prison and came to you?'	Mana i lú ya cennelme lye hlaiwa hya mandosse ar túler lyenna?'
And in answer the king will say to them: 'Truly I say to you: In the measure that you did that to one among these smallest brothers of mine, in the same measure to me you did it.'	Ar hanquentasse i aran quetuva téna: 'Násie quetin lenna: I lestasse ya carnelde ta quenen mici ampitye hánonyar sine, mí imya lesta inyen carneldes.'
Then he will say also to that are standing at his right: 'Pass from me, you that are accursed by my Father, into the eternal fire that has been prepared for the Devil and his angels!	Tá quetuvas yú innar tárar hyaryaryasse: 'Á auta nillo, elde i nar húne lo Atarinya, mir i oira náre ya anaie manwana i Araucon ar valaryain!
I was hungry, and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink,	Anen maita, ar antanelde nin munta matien, anen soica ar antanelde nin munta sucien,
I was a stranger and you did not receive me, naked and you did not cover me, sick and in prison, but you did not care for me.'	anen ettelea ar ualde camne ni, helda ar ualde tumper ni, hlaiwa ar mandosse, mal ualde cimbane ni.'
Then they as well will answer, saying: 'Lord, what was the time that we saw you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and we did not serve you?'	Tá yú té hanquetuvar, quétala: 'Heru, mana i lú ya cennelme lye maita hya soica hya ettelea hya helda hya hlaiwa hya mandosse, ar ualme veuyane len?'
Then he will answer them so: 'Truly I say to you: In the measure that you failed to do so to one among these smallest ones, in the same measure you failed to do it for me.'	Tá hanquetuvas lenna sie: 'Násie quetin lenna: I lestasse ya loitanelde care sie quenen mici sine ampityar, mí imya lesta loitanelde caritas inyen.'
And they will go off into eternal punishment, but the just ones, into eternal life.	Ar autuvalte mir oira paime, mal i failar, mir oira coivie.
And after Jesus completed all these sayings, he said to his disciples:	Ar apa Yésus telyane ilye quetier sine, quentes hildoryannar:
“You know that two days from now the Passover will come, and the Son of Man will be given over to be crucified!”	“Istalde i aure atta ho sí i Lahtale tuluva, ar i Atanyondo nauva antana olla náven tarwestana!”
Then the chief priests and the elders among the people gathered in the courtyard of the chref priest, whose name was Caiaphas,	Tá i hére airimor ar i amyárar imíca i lie ocomner i pacasse i héra airimóva, yeo esse náne Caiafas,
and made plans together to seize Jesus by cunning and to kill him.	ar carner panoli uo mapien Yésus curunen ar nahtien se.
But they said: “Not at the festival, or will be an uprising among the people!”	Mal quentelte: “Lá i aşaresse, hya euva amortie imíca i lie!”
When Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the Leper,	Íre Yésus enge Vetaniasse, mi coarya Símon Helmahlaiwa,
a woman having a stone-box full of fragrant oil came to him, and she poured it on his head when he lay at the table.	nís arwa ondocolco quanta níşima millo túle senna, ar sa-ulyanes caryanna íre caines ara i sarno.
Seeing that, the disciples were wroth and said: “What is the reason for throwing away the oil? For one could sell it for a great sum, to give it to poor!”	Cénala ta, i hildor náner rusce ar quenter: “Mana i casta hatien oa i millo? An mo polde vacitas hoa nóten, antaven sa penyain!”
Knowing this, Jesus said to them: “How is that you are making trouble for the woman, when she has done a good deed to me?	Istala si, Yésus quente téna: “Manen ná i cáralde tarastie i nissen, íre acáries mára carda nin?
For the poor you have always among you, but you will not always have me.	An i penyar samilde illume mici le, mal ualde illume samuva ni.
For when this woman put this fragrant oil on my body, she did it to prepare me for the tomb.	An íre nís sina panyane níşima millo sina hroanyasse, carneses ni-manwien i noirin.
Truly I say to you: Wherever this gospel will be made known in the entire world, what this woman did will also be told in memory of her!”	Násie quetin lenna: Quiquie evandilyon sina nauva carna sinwa i quanda mardesse, ya nís sina carne yando nauva nyárina enyalien sé!”
Then one among the twelve, he whose name was Judas, went to the chief priests	Tá quén imíca i yunque, isse yeo esse náne Yúras, lende i hére airimonnar
and said: “What will you give me if I give him over to you?” And they put thirty silver pieces before him.	ar quente: “Mana antauvalde nin qui antanyes olla len?” Ar panyanelte telpemittar nelequean epe se.
And he sought how he was going to give him over when it was possible for him.	Ar cestanes manen antauvanes hé olla íre ence sen.
On the first day of Unleavened Breads the disciples came to Jesus, saying: “Where do you wish that we prepare for you, for you to eat the Passover?”	Minya auresse Alapalúne Massaron i hildor túler Yésunna, quétala: “Masse meril i manwalme lyen, matielyan i Lahtie?”
He said to them: “Go into the city to so-and-so and say to him: The teacher says: 'My time is near; in your house I will make the Passover with my disciples!”	Quentes téna: “Mena mir i osto ana sie-yo-sie ar queta senna: I Peantar quete: 'Lúmenya hare ná; coalyasse caruvan i Lahtie as hildonyar.'”
And the disciples did as Jesus commanded them, and they prepared the Passover.	Ar i hildor carner ve Yésus canne tien, ar manwanelte i Lahtien.
When evening came, he lay at the table with the twelve disciples. While they were eating, he said: “Truly I say to you: One among you will give me over!”	Íre şinye túle, caines ara i sarno as i hildor yunque. Íre mátanelte, quentes: “Násie quetin lenna: Quén imíca le antauva ni olla!”
In deep grief every one among them began to say to him: 'Surely I am not he, Lord?'”	Núra nairesse ilya quén mici te yestane quete senna: “Lau inye ná sé, Heru?”
In answer he said: “ who dips his hand with me in the bowl is who will give me over.	Hanquentasse eques: “Ye sumba márya asinye i salpesse ná ye antauva ni olla.
The Son of Man will indeed pass away, as is written about him, but woe to the man by whom the Son of Man is given over! was better for that man if he was not born!”	I Atanyondo é autuva, ve ná técina pa sé, mal horro i neren lo ye i Atanyondo antane olla ná! Náne arya tana neren qui únes nóna!”
In answer Judas, who was going to betray him, said: “Surely I am not he, Rabbi?” He said to him: “You have said it!”	Hanquentasse Yúras, ye antauvane se olla, quente: “Lau inye ná sé, Rappi?” Quentes senna: “Elye equétie sa!”
While they were eating, Jesus took a bread, and after speaking a blessing he broke it, and giving it to his disciples he said: “Take it, eat! This is my body!”	Lan mátanelte, Yésus nampe massa, ar apa quetie aistie ranceses, ar antala sa hildoryain quentes: “Ása mapa, mata! Si hroanya ná!”
And he took a cup, and after giving thanks he gave it to them, saying: “Drink of it, all among you!	Ar nampes yulma, ar apa antave hantale sa-antanes tien, quétala: “Suca et sallo, illi mici le!
For this is my blood of the covenant, which will be poured forth on behalf of numerous ones for forgiveness of sins.	An si ná sercenya i véreo, ya nauva etulyaina rá rimbalin apsenien úcariva.
But I say to you: I will by no means drink of this fruit of the vine until that day when I shall drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom!”	Mal quetin lenna: Laume sucuvan sina yávello i liantasseo tenna enta aure yasse sucuvanyes vinya aselde Atarinyo araniesse!”
And after singing the hymns they went out to the Mount of Olives.	Ar apa lindie i airilíri etelendelte Orontenna Milloaldaron.
Then Jesus said to them: “All among you will fall away from me in this night, for it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.'	Tá Yésus quente téna: “Illi mici le lantuvar oa nillo lóme sinasse, an ná técina: 'Petuvan i mavar, ar i lamáreo mámar nauvar vintane.'
But after my being raised, I will go before you into Galilee!”	Mal apa návenya ortana, lelyuvan epe le mir Alilea!”
But in answer Peter said to him: “ if all will fall away from you, I will not fall away!”	Mal hanquentasse Péter quente senna: “Qui illi lantuvar oa lello, inye ua oi lantuva oa!”
Jesus said to him: “Truly I say to you: In this night, before a cock shall sound, you will deny me thrice!”	Yésus quente senna: “Násie quetin lenna: Lóme sinasse, nó tocot lamyuva, ni-laquetuval nel!”
Peter said to him: “If it is necessary for me to die with you, I shall not ever deny you!” All the other disciples said the same thing.	Péter quente senna: “Qui mauya nin quale aselye, uan oi laquetuva lye!” Ilye i hyane hildor quenter i imya nat.
Then Jesus came with them to the place called Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples: “Sit here while I go thither to pray!”	Tá Yésus túle aselte i nómenna estaina Etsemane, ar quentes hildoryannar: “Hama sisse íre lelyan tar hyamien!”
And bringing Peter and the two sons of Zebedee with himself, he began to have grief and to be troubled.	Ar tálala Péter ar i yondo atta Severaio as inse, yestanes same naire ar náve tarastaina.
Then he said to them: “My soul is heavy until death with grief. Remain here and keep yourselves awake with me!”	Tá quentes téna: “Feanya ná lunga tenna qualme nairenen. Á lemya sisse ar hepa inde coive asinye!”
After going a short walk forward, he fell upon his face, praying and saying: “My Father, if that is possible, may this cup pass away from me! And yet, not as I wish, but as you wish!”	Apa menie şinta vanta ompa, lantanes cendeleryanna, hyámala ar quétala: “Atarinya, qui ta ná cárima, nai yulma sina autuva nillo! Ananta, lá ve inye mere, mal ve tyé mere!”
And he came to the disciples and found them asleep, and he said to Peter: “Could you not keep yourselves awake for a single hour with me?	Ar túles i hildonnar ar hirne te lorne, ar quentes Péterenna: “Ma ualde polde hepe inde coive ter erya lúme asinye?
Be awake and pray, or you will fall into temptation! For the spirit is eager, but the flesh is weak!”	Na coive ar hyama, hya lantuvalde mir úşahtie! An i faire mína ná, mal i hráve milya ná!”
Again, for a second time, he went away and prayed, saying: “My Father, if it is not possible that this will pass without my drinking it, let your will happen!”	Ata, mi tatya lú, lendes oa ar hyamne, quétala: “Atarinya, qui ua cárima i si autuva ú sucienyo sa, nai indómelya martuva!”
And he came again, and found them asleep, for their eyes were heavy.	Ar túles ata, ar hirneset lorne, an hendultat nánet lunge.
And he went away from them and prayed for a third time, saying the same word again.	Ar lendes oa tello ar hyamne mi neldea lú, quétala i imya quetta ata.
Then he came to the disciples and said to them: “Surely you are not still sleeping and resting? Behold, the time is near when the Son of Man will be given over into the hands of sinners!	Tá túles i hildonnar ar quente téna: “Lau en húmalde ar séralde? Yé, i lúme ná hare yasse i Atanyondo nauva antana olla mannar úcarindoron!
Rise, let us go! Look! who betrays me has come near!”	Á orta, alve mene! Ela! Ye anta ni olla utúlie hare!”
And while the words were still in his mouth, behold, there came Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great crowd having swords and clubs came from the chief priests and the elders among the people.	Ar íre i quettar en enger antoryasse, yé, tasse túle Yúras, quén i yunqueo, ar óse hoa şanga arwa macillion ar rundalion túle ho i hére airimor ar i amyárar mici i lie.
 who gave him over had given them a sign, saying: “Anyone that I kiss, take him into custody!”	Ye antane se olla antanelyane tien tanwa, quétala: “Aiquen ye miquin, áse mapa mir mando!”
And straightway he went to Jesus and said: “Greetings, Rabbi!”, and he kissed him.	Ar térave lendes Yésunna ar quente: “Hara máriesse, Rappi!”, ar minqueses.
But Jesus said to him: “Fellow, what is your reason for coming?” Then they came forward and laid hand on Jesus and took him into custody.	Mal Yésus quente senna: “Málo, mana castalya tulien?” Tá túlelte ompa ar panyaner má Yésusse ar nampe se mir mando.
But behold, one among that were with Jesus reached out with his hand and drew his sword and struck the chief priest's thrall and cut off his ear.	Mal yé, quén mici i náner as Yésus rahtane máryanen ar tunce macilya ar pente i héra airimo mól ar aucirne hlarya.
Then Jesus said to him: “Put your sword in its place again, for all that take the sword will be undone by the sword .	Tá Yésus quente senna: “Á panya macilelya nómeryanna ata, an illi i mapar i macil nauvar nancarne i macilden.
Or do you not suppose that I can make petition to my Father, for him to send me in this moment over twelve legions of angels?	Hya ual intya i lertan arca Atarinyanna, mentaveryan ninna lú sinasse or lehióni yunque valion?
But then how will it be made true, the Scripture that says that so it must happen?”	Mal tá manen nauvas carna nanwa, i Tehtele ya quete i sie mauyas marta?”
In that time Jesus said to the crowds: “Have you come with swords and clubs, as upon a robber, to seize me? Day after day I sat in the temple teaching, and yet you did not seize me.	Lúme yanasse Yésus quente i şangannar: “Ma utúlielde arwe macillion ar rundalion, ve pilunna, ni-mapien? Aure apa aure hamnen i cordasse peantala, ananta ualde nampe ni.
But all this has happened to make the Scripture true!” Then all the disciples abandoned him and fled.	Mal ilqua sina amartie carien i Tehtele nanwa!” Tá ilye i hildor hehtaner se ar úşer.
Then who seized Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the chief priest, while the scribes and the elders assembled.	Tá i namper Yésus tulyane se oa Caiafas i héra airimonna, íre i parmangolmor ar i amyárar ocomner.
But Peter followed them from afar, as far as the courtyard of the chief priest, and he went inside and sat down with the servants, to see the end.	Mal Péter hilyane te hairallo, tenna paca i héra airimóva, ar lendes minna ar hamune as i núror, cenien i metta.
The chief priests and the High Counsil sought lying testimony against Jesus, for them to kill him,	I hére airimor ar i Tára Combe cestaner húrala vettie Yésunna, nahtieltan se,
but they found nothing, though numerous lying witnesses came forward. In the end, two came forward	mal hirnelte munta, ómu rimbe húrala astarmoli túler ompa. Mí tyel, atta túlet ompa
and said: “This man has said: 'I can throw down the temple of God and build it up in three days.'”	ar quentet: “Nér sina equétie: 'Polin hate undu i corda Eruva ar carasta sa ama ter auri nelde!'”
Then the chief priest arose and said to him: “Are you answering nothing? What is that these people witness against you?”	Tá i héra airimo oronte ar quente senna: “Ma munta hanquétal? Mana ya queni sine vettar lyenna?”
But Jesus was silent. And the chief priest said to him: “By the living God I put you under oath that you will tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God!”	Mal Yésus náne quilda. Ar i héra airimo quente senna: “I coirea Erunen panyan lye nu vanda i nyaruval men qui nalye i Hristo, i Eruion!”
Jesus said to him: “You have said it. But I say to you: From now you will see the Son of God sitting by the right hand of the Power and coming on the clouds of heaven!”	Yésus quente senna: “Elye equétie sa. Mal quetin lenna: Ho sí cenuvalde i Eruion hára ara i Túreo forma ar túla menelo fanyassen!”
Then the chief priest tore his garments, saying: “He has blasphemed! What further need for witnesses do we have? Behold! You have heart the blasphemy.	Tá i héra airimo narcane larmaryar, quétala: “Naiequéties! Mana an maure astarmoiva samilve? Yé! Ahlárielde i i naiquetie.
What do you think?” They answered: “He is worthy of death!”	Mana sanalde?” Hanquentelte: “Náse valda qualmeo!”
Then they spat in his face and struck him with fists,	Tá piutanelte cendeleryanna ar penter se nondaltainen,
saying: “Speak to us as a prophet, o Christ! Who is that struck you?”	quétala: “Queta men ve Erutercáno, a Hristo! Man ná ye pente lye?”
Now Peter sat down on the outside in the court, and a maidservant came to him, saying: “You too were with Jesus from Galilee!”	Sí Péter hamne i ettasse i pacasse, ar núre túle senna, quétala: “Yando elye náne as Yésus Alileallo!”
But he denied that before all, saying: “I do not know of what you are speaking!”	Mal laquentes ta epe illi, quétala: “Uan ista pa mana quétal!”
After he went out to the gate, another maiden noticed him and said that were there: “This man was with Jesus from Nazareth!”	Apa lendes ettenna i andonna, hyana vende túne se ar quente innar enger tasse: “Nér sina náne as Yésus Nasaretello!”
And again he denied it, with an oath: “I do not know the man!”	Ar ata laquentes ta, vandanen: “Uan ista i nér!”
After a short time those that stood around him came and said to Peter: “Indeed you are among them, for your speech reveals you!”	Apa şinta lúme i tarner os se túler ar quenter Péterenna: “É nalye mici te, an questalya apanta lye!”
Then he started to curse and say with oaths: “I do not know the man!” And in the same moment a cock sounded.	Tá yestanes húta ar quete vandalínen: “Uan ista i nér!” Ar mí imya lú tocot lamyane.
And Peter recalled which Jesus said: “Before a cock shall sound, you will deny me thrice!”	Ar Péter enyalde ya Yésus quente: 'Nó tocot lamyuva, ni-laluval nel!”
And he went outside and let bitter tears flow.	Ar lendes ettenna ar láve sáre nírin sire.
When morning came, all the chief priests and the elders among the people made a consideration against Jesus in order to kill him.	Íre arin túle, ilye i hére airimor ar i amyárar imíca i lie carner úvie Yésunna nahtien se.
They bound him and led him away and gave him over to Pilate the governor.	Nunteltes ar tulyane se oa ar antane se olla Pílato i nórecánonna.
Then, when Judas saw that he was being judged, he had a change of mind and brought back the thirty silver pieces to the chief priests and the elders.	Tá, íre Yúras cenne i hé náne námaina, sámes inwis ar talle nan i telpemittar nelequean i hére airimoin ar i amyárain.
He said: “I sinned when I gave over righteous blood!” They said: “What is that to us? You see to it!”	Quentes: “Úcarnen íre antanen olla faila serce!” Quentelte: “Mana ta elmen? Elye cena sanna!”
Then he threw the silver pieces into the temple and went off, and he went away and hanged himself.	Tá hantes i telpemittar mir i corda ar oante, ar lendes oa ar lingane inse.
But the chief priests took the silver-pieces and said: “It is not allowed to throw them into the holy treasury, for they are a payment for blood!” After making a consideration they bought with them the potter's field, as a grave-place for strangers.	Mal i hére airimor namper i telpemittar ar quenter: “Ua lávina hatitat mir i aire harwe, an nalte paityale sercen!” Apa carie úvie homancanelte tainen i cemnaro resta, ve sapsanóme etteleain.
Therefore that place has been named “Bloodfield” until this day.	Etta tana nóme anaie estaina “Serceresta” tenna aure sina.
Then which was said through Jeremiah the Prophet was made true: “And they took the thirty silver pieces, the payment for the man that had his worth fixed, for whom the Children of Israel fixed a payment, and they gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord commanded me!”	Tá ya náne quétina ter Yeremia i Erutercáno náne carna nanwa: “Ar nampelte i telpemittar nelequean, i paityale i neren ye sáme valdierya tulcana, yen i Israelindi tulcane paityale, ar antanelte tai i cemnaro restan, ve i Héru canne nin!”
But Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him: “Are you king of the Jews?” Jesus answered: “You yourself say it!”	Mal Yésus tarne epe i nórecáno, ar i nórecáno maquente senna: “Ma elye aran Yúraron ná?” Yésus hanquente: “Elye quete sa!”
But when the chief priests and the elders said that he had done crimes, he did not answer.	Mal íre i hére airimor ar i amyárar quenter i carnelyanes ongweli, uas hanquente.
Then Pilate said to him: “Do you not hear all the things that they witness against you?”	Tá Piláto quente senna: “Ma ual hlare ilye i nati yar vettalte lyenna?”
And yet he did not answer him, not with a single word. Therefore the governor had great wonder.	Ananta uas hanquente senna, lá erya quettanen. Etta i nórecáno sáme túra elmenda.
From festival to festival a habit of the governor was to release to the crowd a person from the prison, the man that they wanted.	Aşarello aşarenna náne haime i nórecánova lehtie i şangan quén i mandollo, i nér ye mernelte.
At that time was in prison a man called Barabbas, having an evil name .	Mi yana lúme enge mandoltasse nér estaina Varavas, arwa ulca esseo.
Therefore, after they gathered, Pilate said to them: “Who is the person that you wish I am to release to you, Barabbas or Jesus called Christ?”	Etta, apa ocomnelte, Piláto quente téna: “Man ná i quén ye merilde i lehtuvan len, Varavas hya Yésus estaina Hristo?”
For he knew that they gave him over because of envy.	An sintes i antaneltes olla hrúcennen.
Furthermore, when he sat on the seat of judgement, his wife sent to him, saying: “May there be nothing between you and that righteous man, for I had great pain today in a dream concerning him!”	Ente, íre hamnes i hammasse namiéva, verirya mentane senna, quétala: “Nai nauva munta imbi lyé ar tana faila nér, an sámen túra naice síra oloresse pa sé!”
But the chief priests and the elders talked the crowds into requesting Barabbas, but that they were to destroy Jesus.	Mal i hére airimor ar i amyárar mirquenter i şangar arcienna Varavas, mal i nancarumnelte Yésus.
In answer the governor said to them: “Who among the two do you wish that I am to release to you?” They said: “Barabbas!”	Hanquentasse i nórecáno quente téna: “Man imíca i atta merilde i lehtuvan lenna?” Quentelte: “Varavas!”
Pilate said to them: “Then what am I to do to Jesus who is called Christ?” All among them said: “Let him be crucified!”	Piláto quente téna: “Tá mana caruvan Yésun ye ná estaina Hristo?” Illi mici te quenter: “Nai nauvas tarwestana!”
He said: “Then what evil has he done?” But they cried still more: “Let him be crucified!”	Eques: “Tá mana ulco acáries?” Mal yámelte en ambe: “Nai nauvas tarwestana!”
When he saw that he could do nothing beneficial, but that sooner an uprising was going to arise, Pilate took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying: “I do not have guilt of the blood of this man! You see to it!”	Íre cennes i poldes care munta aşea, mal ambe ron amortie ortumne, Piláto nampe nén ar sóve máryat epe i şanga, quétala: “Uan same cáma serceo nér sino! Elde cena sanna!”
And in answer the people said: “Let his blood come upon us and upon our children!”	Ar hanquentasse i lie quente: “Nai sercerya tuluva menna ar hínalmannar!”
Then he freed to them Barabbas, but Jesus he flayed and gave him over to being crucified.	Tá leryanes tien Varavas, mal Yésus rípes ar antane se olla náven tarwestaina.
Then the governor's soldiers brought Jesus into the palace, and gathered the entire soldier-host to him.	Tá i nórecáno ohtari taller Yésus mir i túrion ar comyaner i quanda ohtarhosse senna.
And they took from him his clothes and put on him a scarlet cloak,	Ar nampelte sello lanneryar ar panyaner sesse culda colla,
and they made a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand.	ar carnelte ríe neceliva ar panyaner sa caryasse, ar esce formaryasse.
And falling on their knees before him they spoke to him with scorn, saying: “Hail, king of the Jews!”	Ar lantala occaltanta epe se carampelte senna yaiwenen, quétala: “Aiya, aran Yúraron!”
And they spat on him and took the reed and struck him on his head.	Ar piutanelte senna ar namper i esce ar se-penter caryasse.
And after their scorn against him, they took away from him the cloak and put on him his own clothes, and they led him away to be crucified.	Ar apa yaiwelta senna nampelte oa sello i colla ar panyaner sesse vére larmaryar, ar tulyaneltes oa náven tarwestana.
On the road they found a man for Cyrene called Simon. This man they compelled to carry his cross.	Mí malle hirnelte nér ho Ciréne estaina Símon. Nér sina mauyanelte cole tarwerya.
And when they came to a place called Golgotha, that is, Skull,	Ar íre túlelte nómenna estaina Olyaşa, tá ná, Caraxo,
they gave him wine in a mix with gall, but after tasting it he did not want to drink.	antanelte sen limpe ostimesse as sála, mal apa tyavie sa uas merne suce.
After crucifying him they distributed his garments by throwing lots,	Apa tarwestie se etsantelte larmaryar hatiénen şanwali,
and sitting there they were watching him.	ar hámala tasse tíraneltes.
Furthermore, over his head they put the accusation against him, written: “This is Jesus, king of the Jews!”	Ente, or carya panyanelte i ongwequetta senna, técina: “Si ná Yésus, aran Yúraron!”
Then two robbers were crucified with him, one at his rigth and one at his left.	Tá pilu atta nánet tarwestane óse, quén foryaryasse ar quén hyaryaryasse.
 that passed by blasphemed against him, shaking their heads	I lahtaner naiquenter senna, pálala cariltar
and saying: “You who were going to throw the temple down and re-build it in three days, save yourself! If you are God's Son, come down from the cross!”	ar quétala: “Elye ye hatumne i corda undu ar encarastumne sa ter auri nelde, á rehta imle! Qui nalye Eruo Yondo, tula undu i tarwello!”
In the same manner also the chief priests and the scribes spoke to him with scorn and said:	Mí imya lé yú i hére airimor as i parmangolmor caramper senna yaiwenen ar quenter:
“Others he has saves; himself he cannot save! He is king of Israel; let him now come down from the cross and we will believe in him!	“Exeli erehties; inse uas pole rehta! Náse Israélo aran; lava sen sí tule undu i tarwello ar savuvalme sesse!
He has put his hope in God; now let him rescue him if he wants him, for he said: I am God's Son!”	Apánies estelya Erusse; sí lava hén etelehta se qui hé mere se, an quentes: Nanye Eruo Yondo!”
In the same manner also the robbers crucified with him abused him.	Mí imya lé yú i pilur tarwestane óse naityaner se.
From the sixth hour darkness fell over the entire land, until the ninth hour.	I enquea lúmello mornie lantane or i quanda nóre, tenna i nertea lúme.
Aroud the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a mighty voice, saying: “Eli, eli, lema sabachtani?”, that is: “My God, my God, what is your reason for forsaking me?”	Os i nertea lúme Yésus yáme taura ómanen, quétala: “Eli, eli, lema savahtáni?”, ta ná: “Ainonya, Ainonya, mana castalya hehtien ni?”
When they heard this, some among who stood there said: “This man is calling Elijah!”	Íre hlasselte si, queneli imíca i tarner tasse quenter: “Nér sina yála Elía!”
And in the same moment one among them took a sponge and filled it with sour wine and put it on a reed and let him drink.	Ar mi imya lú quén mici te nampe hwan ar quante sa sára limpenen ar panyane sa escesse ar láve sen suce.
But the others said: “Let him be! Let us see if Elijah comes to save him!”	Mal i exi quenter: “Lava sen náve! Alve cene qui Elia tule rehtien se!”
But Jesus again cried with a mighty voice and expired.	Mal Yésus ata yáme taura ómanen ar effirne.
And behold! the curtain in the temple was torn into two, from top to bottom, and the earth shook, and the rocks were split.	Ar yé! i fanwa i cordasse náne narcana mir atta, telmello talmanna, ar i cemen palle, ar i ondor náner şance.
And the tombs were opened, and many bodies of the sleeping holy ones were raised,	Ar i noiri náner pantane, ar rimbe hroali i lorne airion náner ortane,
and coming out of the tombs after he was raised they came into the holy city and showed themselves to many.	ar túlala et i noirillon apa anes ortana túlelte mir i aire osto ar tanner inte rimbain.
But the centurion and with him that were watching Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and the things happening, were extremely terrified, saying: “This man was indeed God's Son!”	Mal i tuxantur ar óse i tíraner Yésus, íre cennelte i cempalie ar i nati martala, náner ita ruhtaine, quétala: “Nér sina é náne Eruo Yondo!”
There were there many women watching from afar, who followed Jesus from Galilee to serve him.	Enger tasse rimbe nisseli tírala hairallo, i hilyaner Yésus Alileallo vevien sen.
Among them were Mary Magdalene, also Mary mother of Jacob and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.	Mici té náner María Mahtaléne, yú María amil Yácovo ar Yósefo, ar i amil yondoron Severaio.
When evening fell, came thither a rich man from Arimathea called Josef, who also was a disciple of Jesus.	Íre şinye lantane, túle tar lára nér Arimaşeallo estaina Yósef, ye yú náne Yésus hildo.
This man went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. Then Pilate gave the order, and it was given to him.	Nér sina lende Pilátonna ar arcane Yésuo hroa. Tá Piláto antane i canwa, ar anes antana sen.
And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in pure linen,	Ar Yósef nampe i hroa ar sa-vaitanes poica páşenen,
and he put it in a new tomb, which beforehand he made as an artifical cave in the rock. After he rolled a stone to before the door of the tomb he went off.	ar sa-panyanes vinya noiriryasse, ya nóvo carnes ve hróta i ondosse. Apa peltanes sar epe i noirio fennanna oantes.
But Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were still there, sitting before the tomb.	Mal María Mahtaléne ar i hyana María enger en tasse, hámala epe i noire.
On the following day, which was after the Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered before Pilate,	I hilyala auresse, ya náne apa i Manwie, i hére airimor ar i Farisar ocomner epe Piláto,
saying: “Lord, we have recalled which this man of lies said when he was still alive: 'After three days I shall be raised again.'	quétala: “Heru, enayálielme ya tana nér huruiva quente íre en anes coirea: 'Apa auri nelde nauvan enortana.'
Therefore give the order, and the tomb will be protected until the third day, to stop his disciples from coming and stealing him and saying to the people: 'He was raised from the dead!', and the last error will be worse than the first!”	Etta á anta i canwa, ar i noire nauva varyaina tenna i neldea aure, pustien hildoryar ho tulie ar pilie se ar quetie i lienna: 'Anes ortana qualinallon!', ar i métima loima nauva olca epe i minya!”
Pilate said to them: “You have guards. Go and make it as safe as you know!”	Piláto quente téna: “Samilde cundor. Mena ar ása care ve varna ve istalde!”
They went and made the tomb safe by sealing the stone and by putting the guards there.	Lendelte ar carner i noire varna lihtiénen i ondo ar paniénen i cundor tasse.
After the day of rest, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the tomb.	Apa i sendare, árasse i minya auresse i otsolo, María Mahtaléne ar i hyana María túler cenien i noire.
And behold! there occurred a great earthquake, for the angel of the Lord came down from heaven and put away the stone, and he sat on it.	Ar yé! martane hoa cempalie, an i Héruo vala túle undu menello ar panyane oa i ondo, ar hamnes sasse.
His appearance was like lightening , and his garments were snow-white.	Ilcerya náne ve íta, ar larmaryar náner lossie.
For the fear of him the guards shook and were like dead.	Ruciénen sello i cundor paller ar náner ve qualine.
But the angel said to the women: “Do not fear, for I know that you are seeking Jesus, who was crucified.	Mal i vala quente i nissennar: “Ávas ruce, an istan i cesteaste Yésus, ye náne tarwestana.
He is not here, for he has been raised, as he said. Come, see the place where he lay!	Uas sisse, an anaies ortana, ve quentes. Tula, cena i nóme yasse caines!
And go with speed and tell his disciples that he has been raised from the dead, and behold! he is going before you into Galilee; there you will see him. Behold, I have told you !”	Ar mena lintiénen ar nyara hildoryain in anaies ortana qualinallon, ar yé! ménas epe le mir Alilea; tasse cenuvaldes. Yé, anyárien lent!”
And quickly going away from the grave, having fear and great joy, they ran to tell that to the disciples.	Ar lintiénen autala i noirillo, arwa ruciéno ar túra alasseo, nornette ta-nyarien hildoryain.
And behold! Jesus met them and said: “Good day!” . They came to him and seized his feet and fell down before him.	Ar yé! Yésus velde tu ar quente: “Hara máriesse!” Túlette senna ar nampet talyat ar lantanet undu epe se.
Then Jesus said to them: “Do not be afraid! Go, tell my brothers, for them to go into Galilee, and there they will see me!”	Tá Yésus quente túna: “Áva ruce! Mena, nyara hánonyain, menieltan mir Alilea, ar tasse cenuvalte ni!”
But after they went, behold, some of the guards went into the city and told the chief prist about everything that had happened.	Mal apa lendette, yé, queneli i cundoron lender mir i osto ar nyarne i héra airimon pa ilqua ya martanelyane.
And at a meeting with the elders they made consideration, and they gave a sufficient number of silver-pieces to the soldiers	Ar yomeniesse as i amyárar carnelte úvie, ar antanelte fárea nóte telpemittalíva i ohtarin
and said: “Say: 'His disciples came in the night and stole him while we were asleep.'	ar quenter: “Queta: 'Hildoryar túler i lómisse ar pilder se íre anelme lorne.'
And if this comes to the ears of the governor, we shall speak to him, and you do not be afraid!”	Ar qui si tule i nórecáno hlarunnar, elme quetuvar senna, ar elde áva ruce!”
And they took the silver-pieces and did as they were instructed, and this saying has been spread among Jews until this day.	Ar nampelte i telpemittar ar carner ve náne tien peantana, ar quetie sina anaie vintaina mici Yúrar tenna aure sina.
But the eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus said that he was going to meet them,	Mal i hildor minque lender mir Alilea, i orontenna yasse Yésus quente i velumnes te,
and when they saw him, they fell down before him, but some among them were not firm in the faith.	ar íre cenneltes, lantanes undu epe se, mal queneli úner tance i saviesse.
And Jesus went to them and spoke to them, saying: “All lordship has been given me in heaven and earth.	Ar Yésus lende téna ar carampe téna, quétala: “Ilya hére anaie nin antana mi menel cemenye.
Therefore go and make all nations disciples, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit,	Etta á lelya ar cara ilye nóri hildoli, sumbala te mí esse i Ataro ar i Yondo ar i Aire Feo,
teaching them to do all the things that I commanded you. And behold, I am with you all the days until the end of the age!”	peantala te care ilye i nati yar inye canne len. Ar yé, inye ea aselde ilye i rí tenna tyel i rando!”
Paul, in prison for Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon our beloved, who works with us,	Paulo, mandosse Yésus Hriston, ar Timoşeo hánolma, Fílemon meldalmanna, ye mole aselme,
and Apphia our sister who is a soldier with us, and to the congregation that is in your house: May you have mercy and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.	ar Apfia néşalmanna, ar Arhipponna ye ná ohtar aselme, ar i ocombenna ya ea coalyasse: Nai samuvalde oravie ar raine ho Eru Atarelva ar i Heru Yésus Hristo.
I always thank my God when I speak about you in my prayers,	Illume hantan Ainonya ire quetin pa lye hyamienyassen,
since I am hearing about your love and your faith which you have for Jesus Christ and for all the holy ones,	pan hláran pa melmelya ar savielya ya samil Yésus Hristova ar ilye i airiva,
so that you give to others a part in your faith, by the knowledge of every god thing that we have in Christ.	antielyan exelin ranta savielyo, i istyanen ilya mánava ya samilve Hristosse.
And I received joy and comfort by your love, for the warm feelings of the holy ones are renewed by means of you, brother.	An camnen túra alasse ar tiutie melmelyanen, an i airion lauce felmi nar envinyante elyenen, háno.
For this reason, though I have great courage in Christ to give you a command about what is proper,	Sina castanen, ómu samin túra huore Hristosse antien lyen canwa pa ya ná vanima,
I sooner wish to urge you by love, being what I am: Paul, an elder, now also in prison for Christ.	merin ambe rato horta lye melmenen, nála ya nanye: Paulo, amyára, sí yando mandosse Hriston.
I urge you about my child which I begat in my chains: Onesimus,	Hortan lye pa hínanya ye ónen naxenyassen: Onésimo,
formerly without use for you, but now being of use to you and me alike.	yá ú yuhtiéno elyen, mal sí nála yuhtiéno lyen ar nin véla.
Him I make return to you, that is, my own heart.	Sé tyarin nanwene lyenna, ta ná, véra endanya.
I wished to keep him with me, for him to be a servant for me in your place, in the chains that I bear for the gospel.	Mernen hepitas asinye, náveryan núro nin nómelyasse, mí naxi yar colin i evandilyonen.
But without your permission I do not want to do anything, and thus your good deed will not be by compulsion, but by your own free choise.	Mal ú lavielyo uan mere care aiqua, ar sie mane cardalya ua nauva maustanen, mal véra léra cilmelyanen.
Maybe for this reason he was taken from you for a short time, for you to receive him back forever,	Cé sina castanen anes mapaina lyello şinta lúmen, nancamielyan se tennoio,
no more as a slave but as more than a slave, as a beloved brother, above everything to me, but how much more to you, in the flesh and in the Lord alike.	lá ambe ve mól mal ve amba la mól, ve melda háno, or ilqua inyen, mal manen ita ambe elyen, i hrávesse ar i Herusse véla.
Therefore, if you think about me as having a share with you, receive him as if you were going to receive me.	Etta, qui sanal pa ní ve arwa ranto aselye, cama se ve qui camumnel ni.
Furthermore, if he has done anything wrong or has a debt to you, count that against me.	Ente, qui acáries aiqua raica hya same rohta lyen, nota ta inyenna.
I Paul am writing with my own hand: I will pay – not to tell you that your debt to me is your own person.	Ni Paulo téca véra mányanen: Paityuvan – lá nyarien lyen i rohtalya inyen ná véra quenelya.
Yes, brother: may I have gain from you in the Lord. You renew my warm feelings in Christ.	Ná, háno: nai inye samuva ñetie lyello i Herusse! Alye envinyata lauce felmenyar Hristosse.
Being sure that you will do as I want I am writing to you, knowing that you will do more as well, beyond which I write.	Nála tanca i caruval ve méran técan lyenna, istala i caruval yando amba, han ya quetin.
But at the same time prepare for me a place to dwell, for my hope is that by your prayers I shall be released to you.	Mal mí imya lú á manwa nin nóme marien, an estelinya ná i hyamieldainen nauvan leryaina len.
Epaphras, who is in prison with me in Jesus Christ, greets you ;	Epafras, ye ea mandosse óni Yésus Hristosse, suila lye;
also Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke – who labour with me.	yando Marco, Aristarco, Lémas, Lúcas – i molir asinye.
May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit!	Nai i Heru Yésus Hristo lisse nauva as fairelda!
Paul and Timothy, thralls of Jesus Christ, to all the holy ones in Jesus Chrsit that are in Philippi, and to overseers and congregation servants:	Paulo ar Timoşeo, Yésus Hristo móli, ilye i airin Yésus Hristosse i ear Filippisse, ar ortirindoin ar ocombenúroin:
May you have grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.	Nai samuvalde lisse ar raine ho Eru Atarelva ar i Heru Yésus Hristo.
I give thanks to my God whenever I recall you.	Antan hantale Ainonyan quiquie enyalin le.
Always, in every petition of mine for all among you, I make petition in joy	Illume, mi ilya arcandenya illin mici le, carin arcande mi alasse
because of the part that you have in making the gospel known, from the first day until this moment.	i rantanen ya samilde mi carie i evandinyon sinwa, i minya aurello tenna lú sina.
For I am certain about this thing, that he who began a good work in you will also complete it, until the day of Jesus Christ.	An nanye tanca pa nat sina, i sé ye yestane mára molie lesse yando telyuva sa, tenna Yésus Hristo aure.
I do well by thinking so about you all, since I have you in my heart, you that all have a part with me in the grace – by my fetters, and alike by the defending and establishing of the gospel.	Carin mai saniénen sie pa le illi, pan samin le endanyasse, elde i illi samir ranta mí lisse asinye – naxanyainen, ar véla i variénen ar tulciénen i evandilyonwa.
For God is my witness that I long for you all, with the heart of Jesus Christ.	An Eru astarmonya ná i milyan le illi, Yésus Hristo endanen.
And for this thing I am praying: that your love will still be more and more abundant, by knowledge and by keenness of perception,	Ar nat sinan hyáman: i melmelda en nauva ambe ar ambe úvea, istyanen ar laicenen,
allowing you to test the important things, for you to be without stain and not causing others to fall, until the day of the Christ.	lávala len tyasta i valdie nati, náveldan ú vaxeo ar lá tyárala exi lanta, tenna i Hristo aure.
You will be filled with just fruit, which is by Jesus Christ, to the glory and the praise of God.	Nauvalde quátine faila yávenen, ya ea Yésus Hristonen, i alcaren ar laitalen Eruva.
Now I wish that you are to know, brothers, that my condition has caused the gospel to go forward more than stopping it,	Sí merin i istalde, hánor, i sómanya atyárie i evandilyon lelya ompa ambe lá pusta sa,
and so my fetters have been made known in Christ to the entire fortress and to all the others.	ar sie naxanyar anaier cárine sinwe mi Hristo i quanda artan ar ilye i exin.
Furthermore, the greater number of the brothers in the Lord, that have received courage by my chains, more extensively dare to speak the word without fear.	Ente, i amarimbar i hánoron i Herusse, i acámier huore naxanyainen, ambe yondave veryar quete i quetta ú caureo.
Indeed there are some that make Christ known out of envy and quarrelling, but others also sincerely.	É ear queneli i carir Hristo sinwa et hrúcenello ar costiello, mal exeli yando holmo.
They make the Christ known out of love, for they know that I have been put here to protect the gospel.	Té carir i Hristo sinwa et melmello, an istalte i anaien panyaina sisse varien i evandilyon.
But the others do it since they want the strife, not for pure reasons, for they suppose that they will cause tribulation against me in my fetters.	Mal i exi carir sa pan merilte i cos, lá poice castainen, an intyalte i tyaruvalte şangie nin naxanyassen.
Then what? – except that in every manner, with hidden thoughts or in truth, the Christ is made known, and therefore I am happy. Indeed I shall be happy again,	Tá mana? – hequa i mi ilya lé, as nurtaine sanwali hya mi nanwie, i Hristo ná carna sinwa, ar etta nanye valima. É nauvan valima ata,
for I know that so I shall get salvation, by your supplication and by receiving the spirit of Jesus Christ,	an istan i sie ñetuvan rehtie, arcandeldanen ar camiénen i faire Yésus Hristo,
according to my great longing and my hope that I shall be humbled in nothing, but in all boldness the Christ shall be praised by means of my body – as always before, so also now, in life or in death.	ve maivoinenya ar estelinya i nauvan nucumna muntasse, mal ilya veriesse i Hristo nauva laitana hroanyanen – tambe illume yá, síve yando sí, coiviesse hya qualmesse.
For to me life is Christ, and dying, to receive more.	An inyen coivie ná Hristo, ar qualie, came amba.
But if remaining in life means that I can do work that bears fruit, I do not know what I am to choose.	Mal qui lemie coiviesse tea i polin care molie ya cole yáve, uan ista mana ciluvan.
I am drawn between the two: I wish to go away from here and be with Christ, for that is much better.	Nanye túcina imbe i atta: Merin auta silo ar náve as Hristo, an ta nauva ita arya.
But is a greater need that I shall remain in the flesh, for your good.	Ono ea ambe túra maure i lemyuvan i hrávesse, márieldan.
For being certain about this, I know that I shall remain and keep dwelling with all of you, for you to go forwards and for you to have the joy which the faith gives.	Ar nála tanca pa si, istan i lemyuvan ar termaruvan as le illi, menieldan ompa ar i samieldan i alasse ya i savie anta.
Thus it will be possible for you to praise yourselves in Jesus Christ in an abundant manner – concerning me, by my being with you again.	Sie ecuva len laita inde Hristo Yésusse mi úvea lé – pa ní, návenyanen aselde ata.
Solely behave in a manner worthy of the gospel about the Christ! Thus, not heeding if I come to see you or if I am away, it will be possible for me to hear about your condition,, that you stand firm in one spirit, fighting person by person for the faith of the gospel,	Eryave á lenga mi lé valda i evandilyono pa i Hristo! Sie, lá címala qui tulin velien le hya qui nanye oa, ecuva nin hlare pa sómalda, i tarilde tance mi faire er, mahtala quén ara quén i savien i evandilyono,
in nothing terrified by that stand against you. That is to them a sign of undoing, but to you, of salvation. Also this sign comes from God.	muntasse ruhtaine lo i tarir lenna. Ta ná tien tanwa nancariéno, mal len, rehtiéno. Yando tanwa sina tule Erullo.
For to you was given, on behalf of Christ, not solely to believe in him, but also to suffer on behalf of him.	An lenna náne antaina, rá Hriston, lá eryave save sesse, mal yando perpere rá sen.
For you have the same war that you saw that I had, and as you now are hearing that I still have.	An samilde i imya ohta ya cennelde i inye sáme, ar ve sí hláralde i en samin.
Therefore, if is encouragement in Christ, if is comfort of love, if is a sharing of spirit, if are mercy and compassion,	Etta, qui ea hortie Hristosse, qui ea tiutale melmeo, qui ea etsatie faireva, qui ear oravie ar ofelme,
make my joy full by being of one mind, having the same love, being one in soul, having the same thoughts,	cara alassenya quanta návenen er sámo, arwe i imya melmeo, nála er mi fea, arwe i imye sanwi,
doing nothing because of wishing strife or empty glory, but with a lowly mind counting one another greater than yourselves,	cárala munta meriénen cos hya cumna alcar, mal nalda sámanen nótala quén i exe ambe túra lá elde,
heeding not your own matters alone, but also the matters of the others.	címala lá vére nattoldar erinque, mal yando i exion nattor.
Have the same mind that also existed in Christ Jesus!	Sama i imya sáma ya yando enge mi Hristo Yésus!
He, being in God's form, did not count being like God a thing that he was going to seize.	Sé, nála Eruo cantasse, ua nonte náve ve Eru nat ya mapumnes.
On the contrary, he made himself empty and took a thrall's form and was made like a man.	Úsie, carnes inse lusta ar nampe mólo canta ar náne carna ve atani.
And when he found himself in a man's form, he humbled himself and was obedient until death, indeed death on the cross.	Ar íre hirnes inse atano cantasse, nucumnes inse ar náne canwacimya tenna qualme, é qualme i tarwesse.
Therefore God also made him supreme and gave him the name over all names,	Etta Eru yando carne se arata ar antane sen i esse or ilye essi,
to cause to bend every knee, of who are in heaven and of that are on earth and of who are under the ground,	tyarien cúna ilya occa, ion ear menelde ar ion ear cemende ar ion ear nu talan,
and to cause every tongue to say openly that Jesus Christ is Lord, for the glory of God the Father.	ar tyarien ilya lamba quete pantave i Yésus Hristo ná Heru, Eru i Ataro alcaren.
Thus, my beloved, as you have always been obedient, not solely when I was there but now much more when I am away, thus work for your salvation in fear and shivering,	Sie, meldanyar, tambe illume anaielde canwacimye, lá eryave íre engen tasse mal sí ita ambe íre nanye oa, síve mola rehtieldan mi caure ar palie,
for God is who works in you as he thinks well, causing you to wish and to work alike.	an Eru ná ye mole lesse ve sanas mai, tyárala le mere ar mole véla.
Do everything without complaints and quarrelings,	Cara ilqua ú nurrion ar costiéron,
for you to be without stain and clean, God's children among the perverse and twisted people of your time. Among them you shine as light-bearers in the world,	náveldan ú mordo ar poice, Eruo híni imíca i quarce ar rícine queni lúmeldo. Mici té caltalde ve calacolindor i mardesse,
keeping the word of life. Therefore I will praise myself on the day of Christ, that I have not run for nothing or I have toiled for nothing.	hépala i quetta coiviéva. Etta laituvanyexe Hristo auresse, i uan onórie muntan hya omótien muntan.
But also if I am poured out upon the sacrifice and upon the ministry of your faith, I am happy and I have joy with all among you.	Mal yando qui nanye etulyaina i yancanna ar savieldo núromolienna, nanye valima ar samin alasse as illi mici le.
In the same manner, be happy and have joy with me, you as well!	Mí imya lé, na valime ar sama alasse óni, yando elde!
For I have the hope by the Lord Jesus that soon I will send Timothy to you; thus I as well will have the joy of knowing the things that concern you.	An samin i estel i Heru Yésunen i rato mentuvan Timoşeo lenna; sie yando inye samuva i alasse istiéva i nati yar apir le.
For I do not have another with the same inclination , one who sincerely will watch your matters.	An uan same exe arwa i imya óreo, quén ye holmo tiruva nattoldar.
For all the others seek their own matters, not those of Jesus Christ.	An ilye i exi cestar vére nattoltar, lá tai Yésus Hristova.
But you know how he showed his steadfastness – that like a child with father he laboured with me for the gospel.	Mal istalde manen tannes voronwerya – i ve hína as atar móles óni i evandilyonen.
Therefore I have the hope that I will send this man, as soon as I have seen how my matters stand.	Etta samin i estel i nér sina mentuvan, ve rato ve ecénien manen nattonyar tarir.
Indeed I am certain in the Lord that I as well will come soon.	É nanye tanca i Herusse i yando inye rato tuluva.
But I believe there is a need that I send you Epaphroditus, my brother who works and figths with me, but your sent-forth man and a servant for my need.	Mal savin i ea maure i mentan lenna Epafrolíto, hánonya ye mole ar mahta asinye, mal lenya mentaina nér ar núro maurenyan.
For he longs to see you all, and he has had grief since you heard that he was sick.	An milyas vele le illi, ar asámies nyére pan hlasselde i anes hlaiwa.
For indeed he was sick, near to death, but God had mercy on him, indeed not on him alone, but also on me, not wishing that I was to have grief on grief.	An é anes hlaiwa, hare qualmenna, mal Eru oráve sesse, é lá sesse erinqua, mal yando inyesse, lá mérala i samumnen nyére nyéresse.
Therefore I send him that more soon, for you to meet him and for you to have joy, and thus I will have less grief.	Etta mentanyes ta ambe rato, velieldan se ar samieldan alasse, ar sie inye samuva mis nyére.
Therefore receive him in the Lord, in all joy, and let such men be precious to you,	Etta áse came i Herusse, mi ilya alasse, ar lava taiti nerin náve mirwe len,
for by reason of the work of the Lord he came near to death, putting his life in danger to do the ministry which you were prevented from giving me.	an castanen i Heruo moliéno túles hare qualmenna, panyala cuilerya raxesse carien i núromolie ya elde náner hampe antiello nin.
Finally, my brothers: Have joy in the Lord! To write the same things to you is not difficult for me, but to you it is a safety.	Teldave, hánonyar: Sama alasse mí Heru! Tece len i imye nati ua urda nin, mal len nás varnasse.
Watch yourselves for the dogs, watch yourselves for those that work evil, watch yourselves for who cut the flesh.	Tira inde pa i huor, tira inde pa i molir ulco, tira inde pa i cirir i hráve!
For we are the true circumcision, that by God's spirit are servants, and praise ourselves by Jesus Christ, not believing we have our security by the flesh,	An elve i nanwa oscirie nar, i Eruo Fairenen nar núror ar laitar inwe Yésus Hristonen, lá sávala i samilve varnasselva i hrávenen,
though I indeed have reasons for believing that I have security also by the flesh.	ómu inye é same castali savien i samin varnasse yando i hrávenen.
If anyone believes that he has security in the flesh, I have more:	Qui aiquen save i samis varnasse mí hráve, inye same amba:
Circumcized on the eighth day, born into Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews, concerning the Law: a Pharisee,	Oscirna i toltea auresse, nóna mir Israel, Venyamíno nosseo, Heverya Heveryalion, pa i Şanye: Farisa,
concerning burning faith: persecuting the congregation, concerning the righteousness that is by Law: a person who was perfect.	pa uryala savie: roitala i ocombe, pa i failie ya ná Şanyenen: quén ye ilvana né.
But the things that were to me gain, those I have counted as loss , by reason of the Christ.	Mal i nati yar náner nin ñetie, tai onótien ve uñetie, castanen i Hristo.
But indeed I count all things as loss, by the supreme preciousness of the knowledge about Jesus Christ my Lord. By reason of him I have also let all things be lost to me, and I think about them as refuse , for my gaining Christ	Ono é notin ilye nati ve úñetie, i arata mirwiénen i istyo pa Yésus Hristo Herunya. Castaryanen yando alávien ilye natin náve vanwe nin, ar sanan pa tai ve auhantar, ñetienyan Hristo
and for being found in him, not by my own righteousness, that which comes by the Law, but by which exists by faith in Christ, the rigtheousness which comes from God by the faith,	ar náven hírina sesse, lá véra failienyanen, ta ya tule i Şanyenen, mal yanen ea saviénen Hristosse, i failie ya tule Erullo i saviénen,
for me to know him and the power of his resurrection and have a part in his sufferings, being shaped by his death	istienyan sé ar enortieryo melehte ar same ranta perperieryaron, nála cátina qualmeryanen,
– to see if is a way by which it is possible for me to reach to the resurrection from dead.	– cenien qui ea lé yanen ece nin rahta i enortienna qualinillon.
Not that I have received it even now, or that even now I have been made perfect – but I I am pursuing to see if I can seize that for which I am also seized by Christ Jesus.	Lá i acámienyes yando sí, hya i yando sí anaien carna ilvana – mal roitean cenien qui polin mapa ta yan nanye yando mapaina lo Hristo Yésus.
Brothers, I do not believe concerning myself that I have now seized it, but one thing I do: Putting out of my mind that lie behind me and reaching towards that are before me	Hánor, uan save pa imne i sí amápienyes, mal er nat carin: Panyala et sámanyallo yar caitar ca ni ar rahtala yannar nar epe ni
I am pursuing the goal, seeking the reward – God's calling to on high by Christ Jesus.	roitean i met, cestala i paityale – Eruo yalie tarmenna Hristo Yésunen.
Therefore, we that are ready, let us have this matter in mind, and if you have another thing in your thoughts, God will reveal to you also this matter.	Etta, elve i nar manwe, alve same natto sina sámasse; ar qui samilde hyana nat sanweldassen, Eru apantuva len yando natto sina.
But after coming thus far, let us walk forward in the same path.	Ono apa tulie sie andave, alve vanta ompa i imya tiesse.
Follow me in my path, brothers, and heed that walk in a manner following the example that you have in us.	Áni hilya tienyasse, hánor, ar cima i vantar mí lé hilyala i epemma ya samilde messe.
For are numerous ones – I spoke about them frequently, but now I am speaking about them with grief – that walk as enemies of the cross of the Christ.	An ear rimbali – quenten pa te rimbave, mal sí quétan pa té arwa nyéreo – i vantar ve ñottoli i tarweo i Hristo.
Their end will be undoing and their god is their belly, and their glory is their own humiliation , for they have their mind on the things on earth.	Mettalta nauva nancarie ar ainolta cumbalta ná, ar alcarelta ná véra nucumnielta, an samilte sámalta i natissen cemende.
As for us, our country exists in heaven, from where we also wait for a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ,	Pa elve, nórelva ea menelde, yallo yando lertalve Rehton, i Heru Yésus Hristo,
who will remake our lowly body to be like his glorious body, with his power with which he can also put everything under himself.	ye encaruva nalda hroalva náven ve alcarinqua hroarya, túreryanen yanen yando polis panya ilqua nu inse.
Therefore, my brothers beloved and longed-for, my joy and my crown – thus stand firm by the Lord, beloved ones!	Etta, hánonyar melde ar milyaine, alassenya ar ríenya – sie tara tance i Herunen, meldar!
Euodia I exhort and Syntece I exhort: Be of one mind, in the Lord!	Euoria hortan ar Sintíce hortan: Na er sámo, i Herusse!
Indeed I ask also of you, trusty fellow who works with me under the yoke, help them that have toiled with me for the gospel, together with Clement and also the others that work with me, whose names are in the Book of Life.	É arcan yando lyello, sarto ye mole asinye nu i yanwe, á manya tú yet omótiet asinye i evandilyonen, as Hlement ar yando i exi i molir asinye, ion essi ear Parmasse Coiviéva.
Always be happy in the Lord. Again I will say: Be happy!	Illume na valime i Herusse. Ata quetuvan: Na valime!
Let your gentleness be known to all men. The Lord is near.	Lava moicieldan náve sinwa ilye atanin. I Heru hare ná.
Let nothing disturb you, but in everything, by prayer and by supplication with thanksgiving, make your requests known to God,	Lava muntan tarasta le, mal ilquasse, hyamiénen ar arciénen as hantale, cara arcandeldar sinwe Erun,
and God's peace, which surpasses every thought, will watch your heart and your mind by Jesus Christ.	ar Eruo raine, ya lahta ilya sanwe, tiruva endalda ar sámalda Yésus Hristonen.
Finally, brothers: All things that are true, all that are serious , all that are just, all that are pure, all that are desirable, all of which one speaks well, every goodness and everything being worthy of praise – think about them!	Teldave, hánor: Ilye nati yar nanwe nar, ilye yar lunge nar, ilye yar faile nar, ilye yar poice nar, ilye yar írime nar, ilye pa yar mo quete mai, ilya márie ar ilqua nála valda laitaleo – á sana pa tai!
 which you learnt and you received and you heard and you saw by means of me, do them, and the God of peace will be with you.	Yar parnelde ar camnelde ar hlasselde ar cennelde inyenen, tai cara, ar i Aino raineva euva aselde.
Furthermore, I have great joy in the Lord that now in the end you have renewed your thinking about me, to whom indeed you gave thought, but was nothing that you could do.	Ente, samin túra alasse mí Heru i sí i mettasse eceutielde sanielda pa ni, yen é antanelde sanwe, mal enge munta ya pollelde care.
Not that I am talking about lack, for I have learnt to let which I have suffice for me.	Lá i quétan pa penie, an apárien lave yain samin farya nin.
Indeed I know how to suffer lack, indeed I know how to have abundance. In everything and all conditions I have learnt the secret – how to be full and how to be hungry alike, how to have abundance and how to suffer lack.	É istan manen perpere penie, é istan manen same úve. Mi ilqua ar ilye sómar apárien i fóle – manen náve quanta ar manen náve maita véla, manen same úve ar manen perpere penie.
For all things I have strength, by who gives me strength .	Ilye natin samin poldore, yenen anta nin antoryame.
And yet you did well by having a part with me in my tribulation.	Ananta carnelde mai samiénen ranta asinye şangienyasse.
Indeed you know, Philippians, that when the gospel first came to you – when I went away from Macedonia – was not a single congregation that had a part with me concerning giving and receiving, except you alone.	É istalde, Filippiar, i íre i evandilyon minyave túle lenna – íre oanten Maceroniallo – ua enge erya ocombe ya sáme ranta asinye pa antie ar camie, hequa elde erinque.
For also in Thessalonica, one time and two times alike, you sent to me for my need.	An yando Şessalonicasse, er lú ar lú atta véla, mentanelde ninna maurenyan.
Not that I am seeking the gift, but indeed I am seeking the fruit that will be counted to you.	Lá i cestean i anna, mal é cestean i yáve ya nauva nótina elden.
But I have everything and have abundance. I have been filled after I received from Epafroditus the things from you, a fragrant smell, a desirable sacrifice, pleasing to God.	Mal samin ilqua ar same úve. Anaien quátina apa camnen ho Epafrolíto i nati lello, níşima olme, írima yanca, mára Erun.
And my God will fill your every need with his riches in glory, by Jesus Christ.	Ar Ainonya quatuva ilya maurelda laryanen alcaresse, Yésus Hristonen.
To our God and our Father be the glory forever and ever! Amen.	Ainolvan ar Atarelvan na i alcar tennoio ar oi! Násie.
Greet every holy one in Jesus Christ. The brothers that are with me greet you.	Á suila ilya aire mi Yésus Hristo. I hánor i ear asinye suilar le.
All the holy ones, but above all who are in the house of the High King, greet you!	Ilye i airi, mal or illi i ear i coasse i Ingaranwa, suilar le!
May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit!	Nai i Heru Yésus Hristo lisse euva as fairelda!
The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him, to show to his servants that soon will happen. He sent his angel and made it known in signs to John his servant,	Yésus Hristo apantie, ya Eru sen-antane, tanáven núroryain yar ron martuvar. Mentanes valarya ar sa-carne sinwa tanwalínen Yoháno núroryan,
who witnessed about the word of God and the witness about Jesus Christ, everything that he saw.	ye vettane pa i quetta Eruo ar i vettie pa Yésus Hristo, ilqua ya cennes.
Happy is the one who reads aloud, and happy are who hear the words of the prediction and who heed that are written in it, for the time is near.	Valima ná ye et-henta, ar valime nar i hlarir i quettar i apacéno ar i cimir yar nar técine sasse, an i lúme hare ná.
John to the seven congregations in Asia: Grace and peace to you from who is and who was and who shall come, and from the seven spirits that are before his throne,	Yoháno i ocombennar otso Ásiasse: Lisse ar raine len ho ye ea ar ye enge ar ye tuluva, ar i fairellon otso i ear epe mahalmarya,
and from Jesus Christ, the Faithful Witness, the Firstborn out of the Dead, and the Ruler of kings of earth. To who loves us and who has freed us from our sins with his own blood	ar Yésus Hristollo, i Voronda Vetto, i Minnóna Qualinallon, ar i Tur aranion cemeno. Yen mele vi ar eleryanie vi úcarilvallon véra serceryanen
– and made us a kingdom, priests for his God and his Father – be to him the glory and the power forever! Amen!	– ar vi-carne aranie, airimor Ainoryan ar Ataryan – na sen i alcar ar i túre tennoio! Násie!
Behold! He is coming with the clouds, and every eye shall see him, also those who pierced him; and all tribes of earth shall beat themselves in grief because of him. Yes, amen!	Yé! Túlas as i fanyar, ar ilya hen cenuva se, yú i terner se; ar ilye nossi cemeno palpuvar inte nairesse issenen. Ná, násie!
“I am Tinco and Úre ”, says the Lórd God, “ who is and who was and who shall come, the Almighty.”	“Inye Tinco ar Úre,” quete i Héru Eru, “i ea ar i enge ar i tuluva, i Iluvala.”
I John, your brother who has a share with you in the tribulation and the kingdom and the faithfulness in Jesus, was on the island called Patmos because of speaking about God and because of witnessing about Jesus.	Inye Yoháno, hánolda ye same ranta aselde i şangiesse ar araniesse ar voronwiesse mi Yésus, enge i tollosse estaina Patmos quetiénen pa Eru ar vettiénen pa Yésus.
On the day of the Lord I was in spirit, and I heard behind me a mighty voice like from a trumpet,	I Héruo auresse anen fairesse, ar hlassen ca ni taura óma ve hyólallo,
saying: “Write which you see in a book and send it to the seven congregations, in Ephesus and Smyrna and Pergamum and Thyatira and Sardis and Philadelphia and Laodicea.”	quétala: “Teca ya cenil parmasse ar ása menta i ocombennar otso, mi Efesus ar Mirna ar Peryamum ar Şiatíra ar Sardis ar Filarelfia ar Laoricea.”
I turned to see whose voice spoke to me, and after turning I saw seven lampstands of gold,	Quernen immo cenien mano óma quente ninna, ar apa querie cennen calmatarmar otso maltava,
and in the midst of the lampstands one like a son of man, clad in a robe that reached to his feet and having a golden belt bound about the chest.	ar i endesse i calmatarmaron quén ve atanyondo, vaina vaimasse ya rahtane talyanta ar arwa laurea quilto nútina os i ambas.
Furthermore, his head and his hair were white like white wool, like snow, and his eyes like a fiery flame.	Ente, carya ar findelerya náner ninqui ve ninque tó, ve losse, ar henyat ve uruite ruine.
His feet were like gold-colored copper, glowing in an oven , and his voice was like the sound of many waters.	Talyat nánet ve laurea urus, lúşina urnasse, ar ómarya náne ve i lamma rimbe nenion.
In his right hand he had seven stars; out of his mouth went a sharp, two-edged longsword having two edges. His face shone as when the Sun shines in its power.	Formaryasse sámes tinwi otso; et antoryallo lende aica andamacil arwa címa atto. Cendelerya calle ve íre Anar cala túreryasse.
When I saw him I fell like dead before his feet. He put his right hand on me and said: “Do not fear! I am the First and the Last	Íre cennenyes lantanenye ve qualina epe talyat. Panyanes formarya to ni ar quente: “Áva ruce! Inye i Minya ar i Métima
and the living; and I was dead, but behold! I am alive forever and ever, and I have the keys to death and to Mandos .	ar i coirea ná; ar anen qualina, mal yé! nanye coirea tennoio ar oi, ar samin i latili ñuruo ar Mandosto.
Therefore write that you have seen, that are now and that shall happen after this alike.	Etta teca yar ecéniel, yar ear sí ar yar martuvar apa si véla.
About the secret of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand, and of the seven lampstands: the seven stars are angels of the seven congregations, and the seven lampstands are the seven congregations.”	Pa i fóle i tinwion otso yar cennel formanyasse, ar i calmatarmaron otso: i tinwi otso nar vali i ocombion otso, ar i calmatarmar otso nar i ocombi otso.”
I know your deeds and your labour and your faithfulness, and that you cannot bear evil people, and that you have tried who say that they are apostles, but are not, and you have found that they lie.	Istan cardalyar ar molielya ar voronwielya, ar i ual pole cole ulce queni, ar i atyastiel i quetir i nalte aposteli, mal uar, ar hirnel i hurilte.
Also endurance you have, and you have been steadfast for my name, and you have not become tired.	Yú voronwie samil, ar anaiel şorna essenyan, ar ual olólie lumba.
And yet I have against you that you have forsaken the love that you had in the beginning.	Ananta samin ana lye i ehehtiel i melme ya sámel i yestasse.
Therefore remember which you have fallen from, and find repentance and do the first deeds. If you do not, I am coming to you, and I shall take away your lampstand from its place, if you do not find repentance.	Etta enyala yallo alantiel, ar hira inwis ar cara i minye cardar. Qui lalye, túlan lenna, ar mapuvan oa calmatarmalya nómeryallo, qui ual hire inwis.
And yet you do have this, that you hate the doings of the Nicolaitans, which also I loathe.	Ananta é samil si, i tevil i cardar i Nicolaiyaron, yar yú inye teve.
May who has an ear hear which the Spirit says to the congregations: To who conquers I shall give to eat from the Tree of Life, which is in the garden of God.	Nai ye same hlas hlaruva ya i Faire quete i ocombennar: Yen same i apaire antauvan mate i Aldallo Coiviéva, ya ea i tarwasse Eruva.
And to the angel of the congregation in Smyrna write: This says the First and the Last, who was dead and came back to life:	Ar i valanna i ocombeo Mirnasse teca: Sin quete i Minya ar i Métima, ye náne qualina ar nanwenne coivienna:
I know your tribulation and your poverty – but you are rich – and the mockery of who call themselves Jews, and yet they are not, but are Satan’s synagogue:	Istan şangielya ar únielya – mal nalye lárea – ar i yaiwe ion estar inte Yúrar, ananta ualte, mal nar Sátano yomencoa:
Do not fear the torments that now will come upon you. Look! The Devil will now throw some among you into prison, for you to be wholly tested, and that you will have tribulation for ten days . Be faithful until death, and I shall give you the crown of life.	Áva ruce i ñwalmallon yar sí tuluvar lyenna. Yé! I Arauco sí hatuva ennoli mici le mir mando, náveldan aqua tyastane, ar i samuvalde şangie ter rí quean. Na voronda tenna ñuru, ar lyen-antauvan i ríe coiviéva.
May he who has an hear which the Spirit says to the congregations: who has victory will by no means be harmed by the second death.	Nai ye same hlas hlaruva ya i Faire quete i ocombennar: Ye turue laume nauva malana i attea ñurunen.
And to the angel of the congregation in Pergamum write: This says who has the sharp longsword having two edges:	Ar i valanna i ocombeo Peryamumesse teca: Sin quete ye same i aica andamacil arwa címa atto:
I know where you dwell, in which the throne of Satan is; and yet you are keeping my name. You did not deny your faith in me also in the days of Antipas my faithful witness, who was slain by your side, where Satan dwells.	Istan masse marilye, yasse ea i tarhanwa Sátanwa; ananta hépal essenya. Ual lalane savielya nisse yando mi réryar Antipas voronda vettonya, ye náne nanca ara lye, yasse mare Sátan.
And yet I hold a few matters against you, that there are with you who keep the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling block before the sons of Israel, and so they ate that were sacrificed to idols and fornicated.	Ananta samin nótime nattoli ana lye, in ear aselye i hepir i peantave Valamo, ye peantane Valacen panie sar taltiéva epe Israelindi, ar sie mantelte yar náner yácine cordonin ar hrupuhtaner.
Thus there are also with you who keep the teaching of the Nicolaitans.	Sie ear yú aselye i hepir i peantave i Nicolaiyaron.
Therefore find repentance! If you do not, I will come to you soon, and I will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.	Etta hira inwis! Qui lalye, tuluvan lyenna ron, ar mahtuvan téna antonyo macilden.
May he who has an ear hear which the Spirit says to the congregations: To who conquers I shall give of the hidden mán , and I shall give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name not known to anyone, except who receives it.	Nai ye same hlas hlaruva ya i Faire quete i ocombennar: Yen turue antauvan i nurtana máno, ar antauvan sen ninque sar, ar to i sar vinya esse lá sinwa aiquenen, hequa ye came sa.
And to the angel of the congregation in Thyatira write: This says the Son of God, who has his eyes like a fiery flame, and his feet like copper:	Ar i valanna i ocombeo Şiatírasse teca: Sin quete i Eruion, ye same henyat ve uruite ruine, ar talyat ve urus:
I know your deeds and your love and your faith and your service and your faithfulness, and your newest deeds are more than the first ones.	Istan cardalyar ar melmelya ar savielya ar núromolielya ar voronwielya, ar anvinye cardalyar nar ambe lá i minyar.
And yet I hold against you that you do not stop the woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophet , and teaches and causes to err my servants into doing fornication, and to eat things sacrificed to idols.	Ananta samin ana lye in ual pusta i nís Yesavel, ye esta immo Erutercáne, ar peantas ar tyaris ranya núronyar mir carie úpuhtale, ar matie nati yácine cordonin.
I gave her time to find repentance, but she does not want to seek repentance for her fornication.	Antanen sen lúme hirien inwis, mal uas mere cesta inwis pa hrupuhtalerya.
Look! I throw her into bed, and who fornicate with her into a great tribulation, if they do find repentance concerning her deeds.	Yé! Hatuvanyes mir caima, ar i hrupuhtar óse mir túra şangie, qui ualte hire inwis pa cardaryar.
And her children I will let death take, to cause all the congregations to know that I am who searches minds and hearts, and I shall give to everyone among you according as your deeds are.	Ar hínaryar lavuvan ñurun mapa, tyarien ilye i ocombi ista in inye ná ye ceşe sámar ar endar, ar antauvan ilquenen mici le ve cardaldar nar.
But I say to the others among you in Thyatira, to all who do not have this teaching and have not known ‘the deep things of Satan’, as they say: I do not put on you other burden.	Mal quetin i exennar mici le Şiatírasse, illinnar i uar same peantave sina ar uar isistie 'i tumne nati Sátano', ve quetilte: Uan panya lesse hyana cólo.
And yet, keep what you have, until I shall come.	Ananta hepa ya samil, tenna tuluvan.
And who conquers and heeds my deeds until the end, to him I shall give him lordship over nations.	Ar ye turue ar cime cardanyar tenna i metta, sen antauvan hére or nóri.
He shall rule them with an iron rod, for them to be broken into pieces like earthen vessels – the same lordship that I have received from my Father.	Turuvas tai angaina vandilden, náveltan rácine mir mittar ve cemne veni – i imya hére ya inye acámie Atarinyallo.
And I shall give him the morning star.	Ar antauvan sen i arintinwe.
May who has an ear hear what the Spirit says to the congregations!”	Nai ye same hlas hlaruva ya i Faire quete i ocombennar!”
Become awake and strengthen the things remaining that are near to death, for I have not found your deeds completed before my God.	Ola cuiva ar á turya i nati lemyala yar nar hari qualmenna, an uan ihírie cardalyar telyane epe Ainonya.
Therefore recall how you have received and how you heard, and keep it, and find repentance! If you do not become awake, I shall come like a thief, and you will by no means know the hour in which I shall come upon you.	Etta enyala manen acámiel ar manen hlassel, ar ása hepe, ar hira inwis! Qui ual oluva cuiva, tuluvan ve arpo, ar laume istuval i lúme yasse tuluvan lyenna.
And yet you do have a few names in Sardis who have not stained their clothes, and they shall walk with me in white, for they are worthy.	Ananta é samil annótime esseli Sardisse i uar avahtie lanneltar, ar vantuvalte asinye mi ninque, an nalte valde.
 who has victory will thus be clad in white clothes, and I shall by no means take away his name from the Book of Life, but I shall make known that his name is acknowledged by me before my Father and before his angels .	Ye turue nauva sie vaina ninqui lannelínen, ar laume mapuvan oa esserya i Parmallo Coiviéva, mal caruvan sinwa in esserya ná istanwa lo ni epe Atarinya ar epe valaryar.
May who has a hear which the Spirit says to the congregations!	Nai ye same hlas hlaruva ya i Faire quete i ocombennar!
And to the angel of the congregation in Philadelphia write: This says who is holy, who is true, who has David’s key, who opens in a manner stopping anyone from closing, and closes in a manner stopping anyone from opening:	Ar i valanna i ocombeo Filarelfiasse teca: Sin quete ye aire ná, ye şanda ná, ye same Laviro latil, ye latya mi lé pustala aiquen holtiello, ar holta mi lé pustala aiquen latyavello:
I know your deeds – behold! I have placed before you an opened door, which nobody can close. For you have little might, but you kept my word and did not deny my name.	Istan cardalyar – yé! apánien epe lye latyana fenna, ya úquen pole holta. An elye same pitya melehte, mal hempel quettanya ar ua lalane essenya.
Behold! The people from the synagogue of Satan, who call themselves Jews and yet are not, but are lying – behold! I shall cause them to come and fall down before your feet, and I shall make them know that I have loved you.	Yé! I queni yomencoallo Sátanwa, i estar inte Yúrar ananta uar, mal húrar – yé! tyaruvanyet tule ar lanta undu epe talulyat, ar tyaruvanyet ista i emélien lye.
Because you have kept the word of my faithfulness, I too will keep you from the hour of trial that shall come upon the whole world, to test those who dwell on earth.	Pan ehépiel i quetta voronwienyo, yú inye lye-hepuva i lúmello tyastiéva ya tuluva i quanda ambarenna, tyastien i marir cemende.
I will come soon. Keep which you have, to stop anyone from taking your crown.	Tuluvan ron. Hepa ya samil, pustien aiquen mapiello ríelya.
 who conquers I shall make a pillar in the temple of my God, and by no means will he ever go out, and I will write upon him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem that comes down from heaven from my God, and also my own new name.	Ye turue caruvan tarma i cordasse Ainonyava, ar laume oi etelelyuvas, ar tecuvan sesse i esse Ainonyava ar i esse i osto Ainonyava, i vinya Yerúsalem ya tule undu menello Ainonyallo, ar yú ninya vinya esse.
May who has an ear hear which the Spirit says to the congregations!	Nai ye same hlas hlaruva ya i Faire quete i ocombennar!
And to the angel of the congregation in Laodicea write: Thus says the Amen, the faithful and true Witness, Beginning of creation of God:	Ar i valanna i ocombeo Laoriceasse teca: Sin quete i Násie, i voronda ar şanda Vetto, i Yesta ontiéno Eruo:
I know your deeds, that you are not cold or hot. Would that you were cold or hot!	Istan cardalyar, in ual ringa hya lauca. Auve anel ringa hya lauca!
Therefore, since you are lukewarm, and not hot or cold, I shall vomit you out of my mouth.	Etta, pan nalye pellauca, ar lá lauca hya ringa, quamuvanyel et antonyallo.
Since you say: “I am rich, I am wealthy; I have need of nothing” – but you do not know that you are miserable and lamentable and destitute and blind and naked –	Pan quetil: “Nanye lárea, nanye herenya; samin maure muntava” – mal ual ista in elye angayanda ar nainima ar úna ar cénelóra ar helda ná –
I say to you that you do well if you buy from me gold purified by fire, for you to be rich, and white garments, for you to be clad and to stop the humiliation of your nakedness from being shown, and salve to put on your eyes, for you to see.	quetin lyenna i caril mai qui mancal nillo malta poitana nárenen, návelyan lárea, ar ninqui larmar, návelyan vaina ar pustien heldielyo nucumnie návello tanana, ar laive panien hendulyatse, cenielyan.
To all that I love I give rebuke and chastisement. Therefore behave sincerely, and find repentance!	Illin i melin inye anta naitie ar paimesta. Etta á lenga holmo, ar hira inwis!
Behold! I am standing before the door, knocking. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I shall come into his house, and I shall eat the evening meal with him and he with me.	Yé! Táran epe i fenna, tambala. Qui aiquen hlare ómanya ar latya i fenna, tuluvan mir coarya, ar matuvan i şinyemat óse, ar isse asinye.
To who conquers I shall give to sit down with me on my throne, like I conquered and sat down with my Father on his throne.	Yen turue antauvan hame undu óni mahalmanyasse, tambe inye turune ar hamune as Atarinya mahalmaryasse.
May who has an ear hear which the Spirit says to the congregations!”	Nai ye same hlas hlaruva ya i Faire quete i ocombennar!”
After this I saw, and behold! a door opened in heaven. And the first voice that I heard speak with me was like the sound of a trumpet, and it said: “Come up hither, and I shall show you that will soon happen.”	Apa si cennen, ar yé! fenna latyana menelde. Ar i minya óma ya hlassen quéta óni náne ve i lamma hyólo, ar eques: “Tula ama sir, ar lyen-tanuvan yar ron martuvar.”
In the same moment I came under the power of the Spirit, and behold! there was a throne in heaven, and One sat on the throne.	Mí imya lú túlen nu i túre i Faireo, ar yé! enge mahalma menelde, ar Quén hande i mahalmasse.
The appearance of who is sitting there is like jasper and carneol, and around the throne there is a rainbow, like an emerald in appearance.	Ilce yeo hára tasse ná ve nambíre ar culmíre, ar os i mahalma ea helyanwe, ve laimaril ilcesse.
And around the throne there are four twenty thrones, and on the thrones are sitting four twenty elders having white raiments, and thrones of gold on their head.	Ar os i mahalma ear mahalmar canta yúquean, ar i mahalmassen hárar amyárar canta yúquean sámala ninqui larmar, ar ríer maltava cariltasse.
And out of the throne are coming flashes and voices and thunders, and there are seven lamps burning before the throne, which are the seven spirits of God.	Ar et i mahalmallo túlar ítar ar ómar ar hundier, ar ear calmar otso uryala epe i mahalma, yar nar i fairi otso Eruo.
And before the throne there is that seems like a lake of glass.	Ar epe i mahalma ea ya neme ve ailin calcava.
In the middle where the throne stands, around the throne are four living creatures , full of eyes before and behind:	I endesse yasse i mahalma tare, os i mahalma ear coiti canta, quante hendion epe ar cata:
the first living creature is like a lion, the second like an ox, the third has a face like a man’s, and the fourth is like a flying eagle.	i minya coite ná ve rá, i attea ve mondo, i neldea same cendele ve atano, ar i cantea ná ve vilila şoron.
Every one of the four living creatures had six wings, and each living creature is full of eyes around his entire body and inside . Rest they do not have, at day and and night saying: “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty, who is and who was and who shall come!”	Ilya quén i coition canta same rámar enque, ar ilya coite ná quanta hendion os quanda hroarya ar mityave. Sére ualte same, auresse yo lómisse quétala: “Aire, aire, aire ná i Héru Eru Iluvala, ye ea ar ye enge ar ye tuluva!”
And every time that the living creatures give glory and praise and thank to who is sitting on the throne, who lives forever and ever,	Ar mí ilya lú ya i coiti antar alcar ar laitale ar hantale yen hára i mahalmasse, ye coita tennoio ar oi,
the four twenty elders fall down before who is sitting on the throne and worship who lives forever and ever, and they throw their crones before the throne, saying:	i amyárar canta yúquean lantar undu epe ye hára i mahalmasse ar tyerir ye coita tennoio ar oi, ar hatilte ríeltar epe i mahalmanna, quétala:
“You are worthy, our Lord and our God, of receiving the glory and the honor and the power, for you created all things, and by your will they existed and were created.”	“Elye ná valda, Herulma ar Ainolma, camiéno i alcar ar i laitie ar i túre, an ontanel ilye nati, ar indómelyanen engelte ar náner ontane.”
And I saw in the right hand of who sat on the throne a book written on the inside and on the outside, sealed with seven seals.	Ar cennen i formasse yeo hande i mahalmasse parma técina mityave ar i ettesse, lihtana lihtainen otso.
And I saw a strong angel who cried out with a mighty voice: “Who is worthy of opening the book and of breaking its seals?”	Ar cennen polda vala ye yáme taura ómanen: “Man ná valda pantiéno i parma ar raciéno lihtaryar?”
But nobody in heaven or on earth or under earth might open the book or look into it.	Mal úquen menelde hya cemende hya nu cemen lertane panta i parma hya yéta minna sa.
And I was overcome by a great wailing, for nobody was found worthy of opening the book or of looking into it.	Ar anen turúna túra yaimenen, an úquen náne hirna valda pantiéno i parma hya yétiéno minna sa.
But one of the elders says to me: “Do not be wailing! Look! The Lion who is of the tribe of Judah, David’s root, has conquered and may open the book and its seven seals.”	Mal quén i amyáraron quete ninna: “Áva na yaimea! Yé! I Rá ye ná Yehúro nosseo, Laviro şundo, utúruye ar lerta panta i parma ar lihtaryar otso.”
And I saw standing in midst of the throne and the four living creatures, and in midst of the elders, a lamb that had the appearance of being slain , having seven horns and seven eyes, which are God’s seven spirits, the ones sent into the entire earth.	Ar cennen tárala endesse i mahalmo ar i coition canta, ar endesse i amyáraron, eule ye sáme i ilce náveo nanca, arwa rassion otso ar hendion otso, yar nar Eruo fairi otso, i mentanar mir i quanda cemen.
And it went and took the book out of the right hand of who sat on the throne.	Ar lendes ar nampe i parma et formallo yeo hande i mahalmasse.
And when it took the book, the four living creatures and the four twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, every one having a harp and bowls of gold that were full of incense – which is the prayers of the holy ones.	Ar íre nampes i parma, i coiti canta ar i amyárar canta yúquean lantaner undu epe i Eule, ilya quén sámala ñande ar tolpor maltava yar náner quante nisqueo – ya ná i hyamier i airion.
And they sing a new song, saying: “You are worthy of taking the book and of opening its seals, for you were slain, and with your blood you have redeemed people for God out of every tribe and tongue and nation.	Ar lirilte vinya líre, quétala: “Nalye valda mapiéno i parma ar pantiéno lihtaryar, an anel nanca, ar sercelyanen urúniel ennoli Erun et ilya nossello ar lambello ar nórello.
You have made them a kingdom and priests for our God, and they shall rule on earth.”	Acárielyet aranie ar airimor Ainolvan, ar turuvalte cemende.”
And I saw, and I heard a voice of numerous angels around the throne and the living creatures and the elders, and their number was like myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands,	Ar cennen, ar hlassen óma rimbe valalion os i mahalma ar i coiti ar i amyárar, ar nótelta náne ve quaihúmi quaihúmion ar húmi húmion,
saying with a mighty voice: “The Lamb that was slain is worthy of receiving the power and wealth and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing.”	quétala taura ómanen: “I Eule ye náne nahtana ná valda camiéno i túre ar alma ar sailie ar poldore ar laitie ar alcar ar aistie.”
And every creature that exists in heaven and earth and under earth and in the sea, and all the things in them, I heard say: “To who is sitting on the throne and to the Lamb be the blessing and the honor and the might forever and ever.”	Ar ilya onna ye ea mi menel cemenye ar nu cemen ar i earesse, ar ilye i nati tais, hlassen quéta: “Yen hára i mahalmasse ar i Eulen na i aistie ar i laitie ar i alcar ar i melehte tennoio ar oi.”
And the four living creatures said: “So be it!”, and the elders fell down and worshiped.	Ar i coiti canta quenter: “Násie!”, ar i amyárar lantaner undu ar tyerner.
And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures say with a voice like thunders: “Come!”	Ar cennen íre i Eule latyane mine i lihtaron otso, ar hlassen quén i coition canta quéta ómanen ve hundier: “Tula!”
And I saw, and look! a white horse, and who sat upon it had a bow; and a crown was given to him, and he went forth conquering and to conquer.	Ar cennen, ar yé! ninque rocco, ar ye hamme sesse sáme quinga; ar ríe náne sen antana, ar etelendes túrula ar turuyen.
And when he opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say: “Come!”	Ar íre latyanes i attea lihta, hlassen i attea coite quéta: “Tula!”
And another came out, a fiery-red horse; and to who sat on it was given to take peace away from earth, for them to slay one another; and a huge sword was given to him.	Ar exe ettúle, narwa rocco; ar yen hamme sesse náne antana mapa raine oa cemello, nahtieltan quén i exe; ar haura macil náne sen antana.
And when he opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say: “Come!” And I saw, and look! a black horse, and who sat on it had a pair of scales in his hands.	Ar íre latyanes i neldea lihta, hlassen i neldea coite quéta: “Tula!” Ar cennen, ar yé! more rocco; ar ye hamme sesse sáme tolpot máryatse.
And I heard that was like a voice in the midst of the four living creatures say: “A measure of grain for a day’s wages, and three measures of barley for a day’s wages, and do not harm the oil and the wine.”	Ar hlassen ya náne ve óma endesse i coition canta quéta: “Lesta oriva aurepaityalen, ar lestar nelde findoriva aurepaityalen, ar áva mala i millo ar i limpe.”
And when he opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say: “Come!”	Ar íre latyanes i cantea lihta, hlassen i cantea coiteo óma quéta: “Tula!”
And I saw, and behold! a pale horse, and who sat on it had the name Death, and Mandos followed him. And authority was given them over one fourth of earth, in order to slay with a long sword and with famine and with deadly disease and with the beasts of earth.	Ar cennen, ar yé! malwa rocco, ar ye hamme sesse sáme i esse Ñuru, ar Mandos se-hilyane. Ar hére náne tún antana or i canasta cemeno, nahtien andamacilden ar saicelénen ar qualmequámenen ar i hravaninen cemeno.
And when he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those slain by reason of God’s word and of the witness that they had.	Ar íre latyanes i lempea lihta, cennen nu i yangwa fear i nancaron castanen Eruo quetto ar i vettiéno ya sámelte.
And they cried with a mighty voice, saying: “How long, holy and true Sovereign, will you not pass judgment and avenge our blood on those who dwell on earth?”	Ar yámelte taura ómanen, quétala: “Manen andave, aire ar şanda Hér, ual namuva ar ahtaruva sercelma issen marir cemende?”
And a white robe was given to everyone among them; and was said to them that it was necessary for them to be still for yet a little while, until the number was filled also of their fellow servants and of their brothers, who were going to be slain like themselves.	Ar ninque vaima náne antana ilquenen mici te; ar náne tien quétina i mauyane tien náve sende an şinta lúmesse, tenna i nóte náne quátina yú ion málonúroltaron ar hánoltaron, i nauvaner nahtane ve inte.
And I saw when he opened the sixth seal, and a great earthquake occurred, and the Sun changed black like a sack-cloth of hair, and the whole Moon became like blood,	Ar cennen íre latyanes i enquea lihta, ar túra cempalie martane, ar Anar olle more ve fillanne findiva, ar quanda Işil olle ve serce,
and the stars of heaven fell to earth, as when the unripe figs fall from a fig-tree being shaken by a mighty wind.	ar menelo tinwi lantaner cemenna, ve íre i úmanwe relyávi lantar relyávaldallo pálaina taura súrinen.
And heaven passed away like a scroll being rolled up, and every mountain and island moved from where they were.	Ar menel oante ve toluparma nála toluina, ar ilya oron ar tol léver yallo anelte.
And the kings of earth and the mighty and the commanders and the rich and the strong and every thrall and every free person hid themselves in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains.	Ar cemeno arani ar i taurar ar i cánor ar i lárear ar i poldar ar ilya mól ar ilya léra quén nurtaner inte i rottossen ar imíca i ondor i orontion.
And they are saying to the mountains and to the rocks: “Fall upon us and hide us from who is sitting on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb,	Ar quétalte i orontinnar ar i ondonnar: “Á lanta menna ar áme nurta cendelello yeo hára i mahalmasse ar i rúşello i Euleo,
for the great day of their wrath has come, and who can stand?”	an i túra aure rúşettava utúlie, ar man pole tare?”
Thereafter I saw four angels standing in the four corners of earth, holding back the four winds of earth, to stop wind from blowing on earth or at sea or at every tree.	Epeta cennen vali canta tárala i vincassen canta cemeno, avaleryala i súri canta cemeno, pustien súre hlapuyello cemende hya earesse hya ilya aldasse.
And I saw another angel rising from the sunrise, having the seal of the Living God, and he cried with a mighty voice to the four angels to whom was permitted to harm earth and sea,	Ar cennen hyana vala ortala anarórello, arwa i lihto Eru Coireáva, ar yámes taura ómanen i valannar canta in náne lávina mala cemen earye,
saying: “Do not harm earth or sea or the trees, before we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads.”	quétala: “Áva mala cemen hya ear hya i aldar, nó ilihtielme Ainolvo núror timbareltassen.”
And I heard the number of the sealed ones, four and forty and a hundred thousands , sealed out of every tribe of the Children of Israel:	Ar hlassen i nóte i lihtanaron, canta ar canaquean ar húmi tuxa, lihtane et ilya nossello Israelindion:
Out of the tribe of Juda twelve thousand sealed ones, out of the tribe of Reuben twelve thousands, out of the tribe of Gad twelve thousands,	Et nossello Yehúro lihtanar húmi yunque, et nossello Reuveno húmi yunque, et nossello Áro húmi yunque,
out of the tribe of Asher twelve thousands, out of the tribe of Naphtali twelve thousands, out of the tribe of Manasseh twelve thousands;	et nossello Ahyero húmi yunque, et nossello Naftalio húmi yunque, et nossello Manasseo húmi yunque,
out of the tribe of Simeon twelve thousands, out of the tribe of Levi twelve thousands, out of the tribe of Issacar twelve thousands,	et nossello Simeondo húmi yunque, et nossello Levio húmi yunque, et nossello Issacáro húmi yunque,
out of the tribe of Zebulun twelve thousands, out of the tribe of Joseph twelve thousands, out of the tribe of Benjamin twelve thousand sealed ones.	et nossello Sevulundo húmi yunque, et nossello Yósefo húmi yunque, et nossello Venyamíno lihtanar húmi yunque.
After this I saw, and behold! a huge crowd that nobody knows how to count, out of all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clad in white robes; and there were branches of palms in their hands.	Apa si cennen, ar yé! haura rimbe ya úquen ista onote, et ilye nórellon ar nossellon ar liellon ar lambellon, tárala epe i mahalma ar epe i Eule, vaine ninqui vaimassen; ar enger olvar nindornion máltassen.
And they cried with a mighty voice, saying: “Salvation comes from our God, who is sitting on the throne, and from the Lamb.”	Ar yámelte taura ómanen, quétala: “Rehtie tule Ainolvallo, ye hára i mahalmasse, ar i Eulello.”
And all the angels stood around the throne and the elders and the four living creatures, and they fell upon their face before the throne and worshiped God,	Ar ilye i vali tarner os i mahalma ar i amyárar ar i coiti canta, ar lantanelte cendeleltanna epe i mahalma ar tyerner Eru,
saying: “Amen! The blessing and the glory and the wisdom and the thanksgiving and the honor and the power be to our God, forever and ever! Amen!”	quétala: “Násie! I aistie ar i alcar ar i sailie ar i hantale ar i laitie ar i túre na Ainolvan, tennoio ar oi! Násie!”
Then one of the elders spoke to me, saying: “Who are these people that are clad in white robes, and where have they come from?”	Tá quén i amyáraron carampe ninna, quétala: “Man nar queni sine i nar vaine mi ninqui vaimar, ar mallo utúlielte?”
I said to him: “My lord, you know!” And he told me: “These people are who come out of the great tribulation, and they have cleansed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.	Quenten senna: “Herunya, elye ista!” Ar nyarnes nin: “Queni sine nar i túlar et i túra şangiello, ar opoitielte vaimaltar ar ininquitáyer tai sercesse i Euleo.
Therefore they are before the throne of God, and they serve him day and night in his temple, and who is sitting on the throne shall place his tent over them.	Etta ealte epe i mahalma Eruva, ar veuyaltes auresse yo lómisse cordaryasse, ar ye hára i mahalmasse panyuva lancoarya or te.
They shall not be hungry or thirsty again; the sun shall not strike them, or burning heat.	Ualte nauva maite hya soice ata; Anar ua petuva te, hya urtala úre.
For the Lamb in midst of the throne shall be their shepherd, and he shall lead them to springs of living water, and God shall take away every tear from their eyes.”	An i Eule endesse i mahalmo nauva mavarelta, ar te-tulyuvas ehtelennar coirea nenwa, ar Eru mapuva oa ilya nie hendultalto.”
When the Lamb opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven around half of an hour.	Íre i Eule latyane i otsea lihta enge quilde menelde os perta lúmeo.
Then I saw the seven angels that stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them.	Tá cennen i vali otso i tarir epe Eru, ar hyólar otso náner tien antane.
And another angel, who had an incense vessel of gold, came and stood beside the altar, and a great measure of incense was given to him, to make a blend with the prayers of all the holy ones, on the altar of gold before the throne.	Ar hyana vala, ye sáme nisquema maltava, túle ar tarne ara i yangwa, ar náne sen antana hoa lesta nisqueo, carien ostime as i hyamier ilye i airion, i yangwasse maltava epe i mahalma.
And from the angel’s hand, before God, the smoke from the incense rose with the prayers of the holy ones.	Ar ho i valo má, epe Eru, i usque i nisqueo oronte as i hyamier i airion.
Then the angel took the incense vessel and filled it with fire from the altar. And he threw it upon earth; and there were thunders and voices and flashes and a shaking of the earth.	Tá i vala nampe i nisquema ar sa-quante nárenen i yangwallo. Ar sa-hantes cemenna; ar enger hundiéli ar ómali ar ítali ar palie cemeno.
Now the seven angels that had the seven trumpets prepared to sound them.	Sí i vali otso i sámer i hyólar otso manwaner lamyáven tai.
The first angel sounded his trumpet, and there followed hail and fire in a blend with blood, and it was hurled to earth; and a third of earth was burnt, and a third of the trees were burned, and all green grass was burnt.	I minya vala lamyane hyólarya, ar hilyaner helexe ar ruive ostimesse as serce, ar anes hátina cemenna; ar nelesta cemeno náne urtana, ar nelesta i aldaron náner urtane, ar ilya laica salque náne urtana.
The second angel sounded his trumpet, and a thing like a great mountain, burning with fire, was thrown into sea;	I attea vala lamyane hyólarya, ar nat ve hoa oron, uryala narnen, náne hátina mir ear;
and a third of sea became blood, a third part of the creatures in sea died, the that had life; and a third of the ships were destroyed .	ar nelesta earo olle serce, nelesta i onnaron earesse qualler, i sámer coivie; ar nelesta i ciryaron náner nancarne.
The third angel sounded his trumpet, and a huge star fell from heaven, burning like a lamp, and it fell on the third part of the rivers and springs of water.	I neldea vala lamyane hyólarya, ar hoa tinwe lantane menello, uryala ve calma, ar lantanes i nelestanna i sírion ar ehteleron nenwa.
The star’s name is Wormwood. A third part of the waters became wormwood, and many people died of the water, for it was made bitter.	I tinweo esse Sárálaique ná. Nelesta i nenion olle sáralaique, ar rimbe ennoli qualler i nennen, an anes carna sára.
The fourth angel sounded his trumpet, and a third part of Sun was smitten , and a third of Moon, and a third of the stars. Thus a third of their light became darkness; was no light for a third of the day, or for a third of the night.	I cantea vala lamyane hyólarya, ar nelesta Anaro náne pétina, ar nelesta Işilo, ar nelesta i tinwion. Sie nelesta calalto olle mornie; lá enge cala nelestasse i aureo, hya nelestasse i lómio.
And I saw, and I heard an eagle cry with a mighty voice while it was flying in the midst of heaven: “Woe, woe, woe for those who dwell on earth, because of the remaining trumpet-sounds from the three angels that will now sound their trumpet!”	Ar cennen, ar hlassen şoron yáma taura ómanen lan vílanes endesse menelo: “Ai, ai, ai in marir cemende, i lemyala hyólalammainen ho i vali nelde i sí lamyuvar hyólalta!”
And the fifth angel sounded his trumpet, and I saw a star fallen from heaven to earth, and the key to the pit of the abyss was given to him.	Ar i lempea vala lamyane hyólarya, ar cennen tinwe lantienwa menello cemenna, ar náne sen antana i latil i sapto i undumeo.
He opened the pit of the abyss, and smoke rose as from a huge oven, and sun and the air became dark by the smoke from the pit.	Latyanes i sapta i undumeo, ar usque oronte ve hoa urnallo, ar Anar ar i vilya oller morne i usquenen i saptallo.
And out of the smoke came grasshoppers upon earth, and authority like the authority of the scorpions on earth was given to them.	Ar et i usquello túler salquecápoli cemenna, ar náne ten antana hére ve i hére i nastaroron cemende.
 was said to them that they were not to harm the grass of earth or every green plant or a single tree, but only the people not having the seal of God on their forehead.	Náne tien quétina i ávalte malumne cemeno salque hya ilya laica olva hya erya alda, mal rie i queni lá arwe i lihto Eruva timbareltasse.
 was given to them to torment them for five months, but not to kill them, and their torment was like the torment of a scorpion, when it stings somebody.	Náne tien antana te-ñwalie astassen lempe, mal lá te-nahtie, ar ñwalmelta náne ve ñwalme nastaro, íre nastas quén.
And in those days people shall seek death, but they shall by no means find it; they shall long to die, but death shall escape from them.	Ar mí ente rí queni cestuvar ñuru, mal laume hiruvalte sa; milyuvalte quale, mal ñuru uşuva tello.
The appearance of the grasshoppers was like horses prepared for war; and on their head were that looked like crowns of gold; their face was like men’s face,	Ilce i salquecáporon náne ve roccor manwane ohtan; ar cariltasse enger yar nemne ve ríer maltava; cendelelta náne ve atanion cendele,
and they had hair like women’s hair, and their teeth were like lions’ teeth;	ar sámelte findele ve nission findele, ar nelciltar náner ve rávion nelci;
they had breast-plates like breast-plates of iron, and the sound of their wings was like the sound of many chariots with horses that are running to war.	sámelte ambassi ve angaine ambassi, ar i lamma rámaltaron náne ve i lamma rimbe norolleron arwe roccoron i nórar ohtanna.
They had a tail with a sting like scorpions have, and their power to harm people for five months is in their tails.	Samilte pimpe arwe nasseo ve nastaror samir, ar ea pimpeltasse túrelta malien queni astassen lempe.
As a king ruling them is to them the angel of the abyss; his name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in Greek he has the name Apollyon.	Ve aran te-turila ea tien i undumeo vala; esserya Heveryasse Avandon ná, ar Hellenyasse samis i esse Apollion.
The first woe has passed. Behold! will come two woes more after this.	I minya naice avánie. Yé! tuluvat an naice atta apa si.
The sixth angel sounded his trumpet, and I heard a voice from the four horns on the altar of gold before God	I enquea vala lamyane hyólarya, ar hlassen óma i rassellon canta i yangwasse maltava epe Eru
say to the sixth angel, he who had the trumpet: “Release the four angels that are bound by the great river Euphrates!”	quéta i enquea valanna, isse ye sáme i hyóla: “Á lerya i vali canta i nar nútine ara i hoa síre Perat!”
And the four angels were released, who were prepared for the hour, for the day, for the month and for the year, to kill one third of Men.	Ar i vali canta náner leryane, i náner manwane i lúmen, i auren, i astan ar i loan, nahtien nelesta Atanion.
The number of the riders in their army was twenty thousands times ten thousand; I heard their number.	I nóte i roquenion hosseltasse náne húmi yúquean lúr húmi quean; hlassen nótelta.
And so I beheld the horses and those who sat on them in the vision: the riders bore breastplates with the colour of fire and of sapphire and of sulphur, and the head of the horses was like the head of lions, and fire and smoke and sulphur went out of their mouth.	Ar sie yentenye i roccor ar i hammer tesse mí maur: i roqueni coller ambassi arwe i quileo náreo ar lúleo ar ussardo, ar i cas i roccoiva náne ve cas rávion, ar ruine ar usque ar ussar lender et antoltallo.
By these three plagues one third of Men was slain, by the fire and by the smoke and by the sulphur that went out of their mouth.	Nelde sine ungwalínen nelesta Atanion náne nahtana, i nárenen ar i usquenen ar i ussardenen yar lender et antoltallo.
For the power of the horses is in their mouth and in their tail; their tail was like a serpent, having a head, and by means of it they wound .	An i túre i roccoron ea antoltasse ar pimpeltasse; pimpelta náne ve leuca, arwe caro, ar sanen harnalte.
The remaining part of Men, who were not killed by these plagues, did not find repentance concerning the deeds of their hands or cease to worship demons and idols of gold and of silver and of copper and of stone and of wood, that cannot see or hear or walk;	I lemyala ranta Atanion, i úner nahtane sine ungwalínen, uar hirne inwis pa i cardar máltato hya pustane tyere raucor ar cordoni maltava ar telpeva ar urusteva ar ondova ar toava, yar uar pole cene hya hlare hya vanta;
furthermore; they did not find repentance concerning their murders or their sorcery or their fornication or their thefts.	ente, ualte hirne inwis pa nahtieltar hya ñólelta hya hrupuhtalelta hya pilweltar.
And I saw another strong angel come down from heaven, clad in a cloud and having a rainbow over his head, and his face is like Sun, and his feet like pillars of fire.	Ar cennen hyana polda vala túla undu menello, vaina fanyasse ar arwa helyanweo or carya, ar cendelerya náne ve Anar, ar telcoryat ve tarmar náreva.
He had a small, opened book. And he placed his right foot on sea and the left on land,	Sámes pitya pantana parma. Ar panyanes forya talya earesse ar i hyarya noresse,
and he cried with a mighty voice, as when a lion is roaring. And when he cried , the seven thunders spoke with their own voices.	ar yámes taura ómanen, ve íre rá ná rávea. Ar íre yámes, i hundier otso quenter vére ómaltainen.
After the seven thunders spoke, I was going to write, but I heard a voice from heaven that said: “Seal up which the seven thunders have said and do not write them!”	Apa i hundier otso quenter, inye tecumne, mal hlassen óma menello ya quente: “Á lihta yar i hundier otso equétier ar áva tece tail!”
And the angel that I saw standing on sea and land raised his hand to heaven and gave his oath by who lives forever and ever, who created heaven and which is in it, and earth and which is in it, and sea and which is in it: “The time has passed! 	Ar i vala ya cennen tárala earesse ar noresse ortane márya menelenna ar antane vandarya yenen coita tennoio ar oi, ye ontane menel ar ya ea sasse, ar cemen ar ya ea sasse, ar ear ar ya ea sasse: “I lúme avánie!
But in the days in which the seventh angel shall be heard – when he shall sound his trumpet – then God’s mystery shall be completed, according to the gospel that he gave to his servants, the prophets.”	Mal mí rí yassen i otsea vala nauva hláraina – íre lamyuvas hyólarya – tá Eruo fóle nauva telyaina, ve i evandilyon ya antanes núroryain, i Erutercánor.”
And the voice that I heard from heaven spoke to me again, saying: “Go, and take the book that is opened from the hand of the angel who is standing on sea and land.”	Ar i óma ya hlassen menello quente ninna ata, quétala: “Á lelya, á mapa i parma ya ná pantana ho i má i valo ye tára earesse ar noresse.”
And I went to the angel and said to him that he was to give me the little book; and he said to me: “Take it and eat ; it shall be bitter to your belly, but sweet as honey in your mouth.”	Ar lenden i valanna ar quente senna i nin-antauvanes i pitya parma; ar quentes ninna: “Ása mapa ar mata; nauvas sára cumbalyan, mal lisse ve melu sangolyasse.”
And I took the little book from the angel’s hand and ate it; it was sweet as honey in my mouth, but after I ate it my belly became bitter.	Ar nampen i pitya parma ho i valo má ar sa-mante; anes lisse ve melu sangonyasse, mal apa mantenyes cumbanya olle sára.
And was said to me: “You must again speak like a prophet, about peoples and nations and tongues, and many kings.”	Ar náne quétina ninna: “Mauya lyen ata quete ve Erutercáno, pa lieli ar nóreli ar lambeli, ar rimbe aralli.”
And a rod like a staff was given to me, and one said: “Rise and measure the temple of God and the altar and those who worship in it,	Ar sirpe ve vandil náne nin antana, ar mo quente: “Á orta ar á lesta i corda Eruva ar i yangwa ar i tyerir sasse,
but leave out the temple’s outer courtyard and do not measure it, for it is given to nations , and they shall trample upon the holy city for two and forty months.	mal á hehta i cordo etya paca ar ávasa lesta, an nas antana nórin, ar vattuvalte i aire ostonna astassen atta ar canaquean.
And I shall let my two witnesses speak as prophets for sixty and twelve hundred days, clad in cloth of hair.	Ar lavuvan vettonya attan quete ve Erutercánor ter rí enenquean ar tuxar yunque, vaine mi lanne findiva.”
They are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of earth.	Tú nát i milpialda atta ar i calmatarma atta yar tarir epe i Heru cemeno.
If anyone wants to harm them, fire goes out of their mouth and devours their enemies, and if anyone wants to harm them, he shall be slain thus.	Qui aiquen mere mala tú, nár mene et antottallo ar ammate ñottottar, ar qui aiquen mere mala tú, nauvas nahtana sie.
They have the authority to shut up heaven, to stop rain from falling in the days that they are speaking as prophets, and they have authority over the waters, in order to turn them into blood and to strike earth with every plague, whenever they wish. 	Tú samit hére holtien menel, pustien ulo lantiello mí rí yar quétatte ve Erutercánor, ar samitte hére or i neni, vistáven tai mir serce ar petien cemen ilya ungwalénen, quiquie meritte.
And when they have completed their witnessing, the beast that rises from the abyss will make war upon them , and it will conquer them and slay them.	Ar íre etelyaniette vettietta, i hravan ye orya i undumello ohtacaruva túna, ar turúvas tu ar nahtuva tu.
And their corpses shall lie in the broad street in the huge city that in the manner of spirit is called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified.	Ar loicottat caituvat i palla mallesse i hoa ostosse ya mi lé i faireo ná estaina Sorom ar Mirrandor, yasse yú Herutta tarwestana né.
Persons of the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations shall look upon their corpses for three and a half days, and they do not permit that their corpses are put in a grave.	Ennoli i lieron ar nossion ar lambion ar nórion yétuvar loicottat ter rí nelde ar perta, ar ualte lave i loicottat nát panyane sapsasse.
And those who dwell on earth have joy concerning them and are happy, and they shall send gifts to one another, for these two prophets tormented those who dwell on earth.	Ar i marir cemende samir alasse pa tú ar nar valime, ar mentauvalte annar quén i exenna, an Erutercáno atta sine ñwalyanet i marir cemende.
But after the three and a half days life-spirit from God came into them, and they rose on their feet, and great fear fell upon those who looked at them.	Mal apa i rí nelde ar perta coiviefaire Erullo túle minna tu, ar orontette taluttatse, ar túra caure lantane innar yenter tu.
And they heard a mighty voice out of heaven say to them: “Come up here!” And they went into heaven in the cloud, and their enemies saw them.	Ar hlassette taura óma et menello quéta túna: “Tula ama sir!” Ar lendette mir menel i fanyasse, ar cotumottar cenner tu.
And at that time was a great earthquake, and one tenth of the city collapsed, and seven thousand people were killed by the earthquake, and who remained were terrified and gave glory to God of heaven.	Ar lúme yanasse enge túra cempalie, ar quaista i osto atalante, ar queni húmi otso náner nahtane i cempaliénen, ar i lemner náner ruhtane ar antaner alcar Erun menelo.
The second woe has passed. Behold! the third woe shall come soon.	I attea naice avánie. Yé! i neldea naice tuluva ron.
And the seventh angel sounded his trumpet. And mighty voices were being heard in heaven, saying: “The kingdom of the world has become our Lord’s and his Christ’s, and he will rule forever and ever.”	Ar i otsea vala lamyane hyólarya. Ar taure ómali náner hláraine menelde, quétala: “I aranie i mardo olólie Herulvo ar Hristoryo, ar turuvas tennoio ar oi.”
And the four and twenty elders that sat before God on their thrones fell on their faces and worshipped God,	Ar i amyárar canta ar yúquean i hammer epe Eru mahalmaltassen lantaner cendeleltannar ar tyerner Eru,
saying: “We thank you, Lord God, the Almighty, who is and who was, for you have taken your great power and rule as king.	quétala: “Hantalme lyen, Héru Eru, i Iluvala, ye ea ar ye enge, an amápiel túra túrelya ar ture ve aran.
But nations were wrathful, and your own wrath came, and the time for judging the dead and for giving reward to your servants the prophets, and to the holy ones and to those who fear your name, to the small and the great, and for destroying who destroy earth. 	Mal nóri náner rúşie, ar véra rúşelya túle, ar i lúme namien i qualinar ar antáven paityale núrolyain i Erutercánor, ar i airin ar in rucir esselyallo, i pityain yo i túrain, ar nancarien i nancarir cemen.”
And God’s temple that is in heaven was opened, and the ark of his covenant was being seen in his temple. And were flashes and voices and thunders and an earthquake and great hail.	Ar i corda Eruva ya ea menelde náne latyana, ar i colca véreryo náne cénaina cordaryasse. Ar enger ítali ar ómali ar hundiéli ar cempalie ar túra helexe.
And a great sign was being seen in heaven, a woman clad in Sun, and Moon was under her feet, and on her head was a crown of twelve stars.	Ar túra tanwa náne cénaina menelde, nís vaina Anaresse, ar Işil enge nu talyat, ar caryasse enge ríe tinwiva yunque.
She was heavy with child, and she cries in her pains and in her agony to bear .	Anes lunga hínanen, ar yamas naiceryassen ar ñwalmeryasse colien.
And another sign was seen in heaven, and behold! a huge fiery-red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and on its heads it has seven diadems.	Ar hyana tanwa náne cénina menelde, ar yé! hoa narwa hlóce, arwa carion otso ar rassion quean, ar caryassen samis şarnuntar otso.
Its tail drags one third of the stars of heaven, and it throws them down upon earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was ready to bear , for it to devour her child when she would bear .	Pimperya tuce nelesta i tinwion menelo, ar hantes tai undu cemenna. Ar i hlóce tarne epe i nís ye náne manwa colien, ammatieryan hínarya íre hé columne.
And she bore a son, a boy, who shall rule all nations with an iron rod. And her child was seized away to God and to his throne.	Ar colles yondo, seldo, ye turuva ilye nóri angaina vandilden. Ar hínarya náne mapana oa Erunna ar mahalmaryanna.
And the woman escaped into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by God, for them to give her her needs there for sixty and twelve hundred days.	Ar i nís úşe mir i ravanda, yasse samis nóme manwana lo Eru, antáveltan sen tasse maureryar ter rí enenquean ar tuxar yunque.
And a war occurred in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon and its angels fought,	Ar ohta martane menelde: Mícael ar valaryar mahtaner i hlócenna, ar i hlóce ar valaryar mahtaner,
but he did not conquer, and for them no place was found in heaven anymore .	mal uas turune, ar tien nóme úne ambe híraina menelde.
And the great dragon was thrown down, the ancient serpent, who is called the Devil and Satan, who causes entire world to err – he was thrown down upon earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.	Ar i túra hlóce náne hátina undu, i enwina leuca, ye ná estaina i Arauco ar Sátan, ye tyare quanda Ambar ranya – anes hátina undu cemenna, ar valaryar náner hátine undu óse.
And I heard a mighty voice from heaven say: “Now the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the lordship of his Christ have come, for the accuser of our brothers is thrown down, who spoke evil against them day and night before our God!	Ar hlassen taura óma menello quéta: “Sí utúlier i rehtie ar i túre ar i aranie Ainolvo ar i hére Hristoryo, an i ulquéto hánolvaron hátina undu ná, ye te quente ulco ana te mi aure yo lóme epe Ainolva!
And they conquered him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their witness, and their lives were not to them so dear that they refused to see death.	Ar turuneltes i Euleo sercenen ar vettielto quettanen, ar coivieltar úner tien ta melde i avanelte vele qualme.
Therefore be happy, o heaven and who dwell in it! Alas for earth and sea! For the Devil has come down to you , having great wrath, knowing that his time is short.”	Etta na valime, a menel ar i marir sasse! Ai cemenen ar earen! An i Arauco utúlie undu lenta, arwa túra rúşeo, istala i lúmerya şinta ná.”
And when the dragon saw that it was thrown down upon earth, it pursued the woman who bore the boy.	Ar íre i hlóce cenne i anes hátina undu cemenna, roitanes i nís ye colde i seldo.
But the two wings of the great eagle were given to the woman, for her to be able to fly into the wilderness to her place; there she receives her needs for a time and times and half of a time, far from the face of the serpent.	Mal rámat i túra şorno nánet antane i nissen, polieryan vile mir i ravanda nómeryanna; tasse camis maureryar ter lúme ar lúmeli ar perta lúmeo, haira i leuco cendelello.
And the serpent sent water like a river from its mouth after the woman, to carry her away by the river.	Ar i leuca mentane nén ve síre antoryallo apa i nís, se-colien oa i sírenen.
But earth helped the woman, and earth opened its mouth and swallowed the river that the dragon vomited from its mouth.	Mal cemen manyane i nís, ar cemen latyane antorya ar hlunce i síre ya quamne i hlóce antoryallo.
And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went away to make war on who remained of her seed, who keep the commandments of God and have the witness about Jesus.	Ar i hlóce náne rúşea i nissenna, ar lende oa ohtacarien innar lemner erderyo, i hepir i axani Eruo ar samir i vettie pa Yésus.
And it stood on the sand by sea.And I saw a beast rising out of sea, having ten horns and seven heads, and on its horns it has ten diadems, and on its heads are names of mockery of God.	Ar tarnes i litsesse ara ear.Ar cennen hravan ortala et earello, arwa rassion quean ar carion otso, ar rasseryassen samis şarnuntar quean, ar cariryassen ear esseli yaiweo Eruva.
And the beast that I saw was like a leopard, but its feet were like a bear’s feet, and its mouth was like a lion’s mouth. And the dragon gave it its power and its throne and great authority .	Ar i hravan ye cennen náne ve picara, mal taliryar náner ve morco tali, ar antorya náne ve rávo anto. Ar i hlóce antane sen túrerya ar mahalmarya ar túra hére.
The appearance of one of its heads was as if it was wounded to death, but its death-wound was healed, and the entire earth followed the beast in wonder.	I nemesta ero caryaron náne ve qui anes harna qualmen, mal qualmeharwerya náne nestaina, ar i quanda cemen hilyane i hravan elmendasse.
And they worshiped the dragon since it gave the authority to the beast, and they worshiped the beast saying: “Who is like the beast, and who can fight against it?”	Ar tyernelte i hlóce pan antanes i hére i hravanen, ar tyernelte i hravan quétala: “Man ve i hravan ná, ar man pole mahta senna?”
And was given to it a mouth speaking great things and mockeries against God, and it received authority to do what it wants for two and forty months.	Ar náne sen antana anto quétala túre nati ar yaiwi Erunna, ar camnes hére carien ya meris astain atta ar canaquean.
And it opened its mouth in mockeries against God, to speak mockeries against his name and against his abode, and of who dwell in heaven.	Ar latyanes antorya yaiwessen Erunna, quetien yaiwi esseryanna ar vehteryanna, ar innar marir menelde.
And was given to it to make war on the holy ones and to conquer them, and it received authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation.	Ar náne sen antana care ohta i airinnar ar turue te, ar camnes hére or ilya nosse ar lie ar lambe ar nóre.
And all who dwell on earth will worship it, they whose names are not written in the Book of Live of the Lamb who was killed from the founding of the world.	Ar ilye i marir cemende se-tyeruvar, té ion essi uar técine Parmasse Coiviéva i Euleva ye náne nanca i tulciello i mardeva.
Anyone having an ear, may he hear!	Aiquen arwa hlaro, nai hlaruvas!
If a person is for prison, into prison he goes. If a person will kill by sword, he will be killed by sword . Here is need of faithfulness and of faith of the holy ones.	Qui quén mandon ná, mir mando menis. Qui quén nahtuva macilden, nauvas nanca macilden. Sís ea maure voronweva ar saviéva i airion.
And I saw another beast, that rose out of earth, and it had two horns like a lamb, but it spoke as a dragon.	Ar cennen hyana hravan, ye oronte et cemello, ar sámes rasset ve eule, mal carampes ve hlóce.
It wields the entire authority of the first beast before its eyes. It causes earth and who dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose death-wound was healed.	Mahtas i quanda hére i minya hravano epe henduryat. Tyaris cemen ar i marir sasse tyere i minya hravan, yeo qualmeharwe náne nestana.
And it does great signs; also fire it causes to fall down out of heaven to earth before eyes of men.	Ar caris túre tanwar; yando nár tyaris lanta undu et menello cemenna epe hendu atanion.
And it causes to err who dwell on earth, by the signs that it is allowed to do before the eyes of the beast. It says to who dwell on earth that they are to make image of the beast, who received the wound of a sword and came back to life.	Ar tyaris vare i marir cemende, i tanwainen yar nar sen lávina care epe hendu i hravano. Quetis innar marir cemende i caruvalte emma i hravano, ye camne i nahte macilo ar nanwenne coivienna.
Furthermore, was granted to it to give breath to the beast’s image, causing the beast's image to talk, and also causing to be slain all who refused to worship the beast's image.	Ente, náne sen lávina anta şúle i hravano emman, tyárala i hravano emma carpa, ar yú tyárala náve nahtane illi i váquenter tyere i hravano emma.
And it causes all, the small and the great, the rich and the poor, and the free and the thralls, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their forehead,	Ar tyaris illi, i pityar ar i túrar, i lárear ar i penyar, ar i lérar ar i móli, came tehta formaltasse hya timbareltasse,
and nobody was allowed to trade or sell except a person having the mark – the beast’s name or the number of its name.	ar úquen náne lávina manca hya vace hequa quén arwa i tehto – i hravano esse hya i nóte esseryo.
Here is need of wisdom: Let the intelligent one calculate the beast’s number, for it is a man’s number, and its name is six and sixty and six hundreds .	Sís ea maure sailiéva: Lava i handan note i hravano nóte, an nás atano nóte, ar nóterya ná enque ar enenquean ar tuxar enque.
And I saw, and behold! the Lamb was standing on Mount Sion, and with it four and forty and a hundred thousands that have his name and the name of his Father written on their forehead.	Ar cennen, ar yé! i Eule tárane to Oron Síon, ar as sé húmi canta canaquean ar tuxa i samir esserya ar i esse Ataryo técine timbareltasse.
And I heard a sound out of heaven, like the sound of many waters and like the sound of great thunder; and the sound that I heard was like harpers that play on their harps.	Ar hlassen lamma et menello, ve i lamma rimbe nenion ar ve i lamma túra hundiéno; ar i lamma ya hlassen náne ve ñandaror i tyalir ñandeltainen.
And they sing a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders, and it was not possible for anyone to learn that song except the four and forty and hundred thousands, that are bought from earth.	Ar lirilte vinya líre epe i mahalma ar epe i coiti canta ar i amyárar, ar ua ence aiquenen pare líre tana hequa i húmi canta canaquean ar tuxa, i nar mancane cemello.
They are that have not defiled themselves with women, for they are virgins. They are that follow the Lamb every place it goes. They are bought from among Men as first fruits for God and for the Lamb,	Té nar i uar avahtie inte nissínen, an nalte vendi. Té nar i hilyar i Eule ilya nómenna ya lelyas. Anelte mancane ho mici Atani ve minye yávi Erun ar i Eulen,
and lie was not found in their mouth; they are without spot.	ar huru úne hírina antoltasse; nalte pen mordo.
And I saw another angel fly in midst of heaven, having had an eternal gospel, for him to make it known to who dwell on earth, and to every nation and tribe and tongue and people,	Ar cennen hyana vala víla endesse menelo, arwa oira evandilyono, sa-carieryan sinwa in marir cemende, ar ilya nóren ar nossen ar lamben ar lien,
saying with a mighty voice: “Fear God and give him glory, for the hour of his judgment has come, and worship who made heaven and earth and sea and springs of water.”	quétala taura ómanen: “Ruca Erullo ar ásen anta alcar, an i lúme námieryo utúlie, ar tyera ye carne menel cemenye ar ear ar ehteler nenwa.”
And another, a second angel, followed saying: “She has fallen! Babylon the Great has fallen, who caused all nations to drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication!”	Ar exe, attea vala, hilyane quétala: “Alanties! Alantie Vável Túra, ye tyarne ilye nóri suce i limpeo i rúşeva hrupuhtaleryo!”
And another angel, a third, followed them, saying in a mighty voice: “If anyone worships the beast and its image, and receives the mark on his forehead or on his hand,	Ar hyana vala, neldea, hilyane tu, quétala taura ómanen: “Qui aiquen tyere i hravan ar emmarya, ar came i tehta timbareryasse hya máryasse,
he shall also drink from the vine of the anger of God that is being poured pure into the cup of his wrath, and he shall be tormented by fire and sulfur before the holy angels and before the Lamb.	issue yú sucuva i limpeo i ormeva Eruo ya ná ulyaina poica mir i yulma rúşeryava, ar nauvas ñwalyaina nárenen ar ussardenen epe i airi vali ar epe i Eule.
And the smoke of their torment rises up forever and ever, and day and night they do not have rest, those who worship the beast and its image, and anyone who receives the mark of its name.	Ar i usque ñwalmelto orta ama tennoio ar oi, ar auresse yo lómisse ualte same sére, i tyerir i hravan ar emmarya, ar aiquen ye came i tehta esseryo.
Here is need of the faithfulness of the holy ones, those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.”	Sís ea maure i voronwiéva i airion, i hepir i axani Eruo ar i savie Yésuo.”
And I heard a voice from heaven say: “Write: Happy are the dead who die in the Lord, from now . Yes, the Spirit says, let them rest from their labors, for their deeds follow them.”	Ar hlassen óma et menello quéta: “Teca: Valime nar i qualinar i qualir i Herusse, ho sí. Ná, i Faire quete, lava tien sere molieltallon, an cardaltar te-hilyar.”
And I saw, and behold: a white cloud, and on the cloud a person like a son of man sat, having a crown of gold on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand.	Ar cennen, ar yé! fána fanya, ar i fanyasse quén ve atanyondo hamme, sámala ríe maltava caryasse ar aica circa máryasse.
And another angel went forth from the temple, crying with a mighty voice to who sat on the cloud: “Put your sickle in and reap, for the time of harvest has come, and the harvest of earth is ripe.”	Ar hyana vala etelende i cordallo, yámala taura ómanen yenna hamme i fanyasse: “Á menta circalya ar cirihta, an i lúme yáviéno utúlie, ar cemeno yávie manwa ná.”
And who sat on the cloud sent his sickle over the earth, and earth was reaped.	Ar ye hamme i fanyasse mentane circarya olla cemen, ar cemen náne cirihtana.
And another angel went forth from the temple that is in heaven, he too having a sharp sickle.	Ar hyana vala etelende i cordallo ya ea menelde, yú isse arwa aica circo.
And another angel went forth from the altar, who had authority over the fire. And he cried with a mighty voice to who had the sharp sickle, saying: “Put in your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the wine of earth, for its grapes are ripe.”	Ar hyana vala etelende i yangwallo, ye sáme hére or i náre. Ar yámes taura ómanen yenna sáme i aica circa, quétala: “Á menta aica circalya ar á comya i loxi liantasseo cemeno, an tiumaryar nar manwe.”
And the angel used his sickle on earth and gathered the fruit of the vine of earth, and threw it into the great wine-press of the wrath of God.	Ar i vala mahtane circarya cemende ar comyane i yáve liantasseo cemeno, ar sa-hante mir i hoa limpevorma rúşeva Eruo.
Outside of the city the wine-press was trodden, and blood poured from the wine-press as high as the bridles of the horses, six hundred and a thousand furlongs away from it.	Ettesse i osto i limpevorma náne vattana, ar serce ulle i limpevormallo ve tárave ve i antolattar i roccoron, restandier tuxar enque ar húme oa sallo.
And I saw another sign in heaven, great and wonderful: seven angels having seven plagues, the last ones, for by them God’s anger is finished.	Ar cennen hyana tanwa menelde, túra ar elmendea: vali otso arwe ungwaleron otso, i métimar, an tainen Eruo orme ná telyana.
And I saw a thing like a lake of glass, in a blend with fire, and who had conquered the beast and its image and the number of its name stood next to the lake of glass, having harps of God.	Ar cennen nat ve ailin calcava, ostimesse as náre, ar i turunelyaner i hravan ar emmarya ar esseryo nóte tarner ara i ailin calcava, arwe ñandélion Eruva.
And they sing the song of Moses, God’s servant, and the song of the Lamb, saying: “Great and wonderful are your works , Lord God, the Almighty. Just and true are your ways, King of nations.	Ar lindalte i líre Móseo, Eruo núro, ar i líre i Euleo, quétala: “Túre ar elmendie nar cardalyar, Héru Eru, i Iluvala. Faile ar şande nar tielyar, Aran nórion.
Who shall not fear you, o Lord, and give glory to your name? For you alone are holy. For all nations shall come and worship before you, for your righteous judgments have been revealed.”	Man ua rucuva lyello, a Héru, ar antauva alcar esselyan? An elye erinqua aire ná. An ilye nóri tuluvar ar tyeruvar epe lye, an faile námielyar anaier apantane.”
And after these things I saw, and the sanctuary of the Tent of Witness was opened in heaven,	Ar apa nati sine cennen, ar i yána i Lancavo Vettiéva náne latyana menelde,
and the seven angels having the seven plagues went forth from the sanctuary, clad in pure, bright linen and bound about their breast with golden girdles.	ar i vali otso arwe i ungwaleron otso etelender i yánallo, vaine poica, calima páşesse ar nútine os ambostelta laurie quiltainen.
And one of the four living cratures gave the seven angels seven bowls of gold that were full of the anger of God, who lives forever and ever.	Ar quén i coition canta antane i valin otso tolpor otso maltava yar náner quante i ormeo Eruo, ye coita tennoio ar oi.
And the sanctuary was filled with smoke, by the glory of God and by his power, and nobody could come into the sanctuary until the seven plagues of the seven angels were finished.	Ar i yána náne quátina usqueo, i alcarnen Eruo ar túreryanen, ar úquen polde tule mir i yána tenna i ungwaler otso i valion otso náner telyane.
And I heard a mighty voice from the sanctuary say to the seven angels: “Go and pour the seven bowls of the anger of God into earth!”	Ar hlassen taura óma et i yánallo quéta i valannar otso: “Á lelya ar ulya i tolpor otso ormeva Eruo mir cemen!”
And the first went forth and poured his bowl into earth. And came foul and painful ulcers on the men who had the mark of the beast and worshipped its image.	Ar i minya etelende ar ulyane tolporya mir cemen. Ar túler şaure ar naicalie sisti i atanissen i sámer i hravano tehta ar tyerner emmarya.
And the second poured his bowl into earth. And it became blood like the blood from a corpse, and every living creature died, who were on earth.	Ar i attea ulyane tolporya mir ear. Ar olles serce ve i serce loicollo, ar ilya coirea onna qualle, i enger earesse.
And the third poured his bowl into the rivers and the springs of water, and they became blood.	Ar i neldea ulyane tolporya mir i síri ar i ehteler nenwa, ar ollelte serce.
And I heard the angel of the waters say: “Righteous you are, who is and who was, the holy , for so you have passed judgment!	Ar hlassen i vala i nenion quéta: “Faila nalye, i ea ar i enge, i aire, an sie anámiel!
For they poured blood of holy ones and of prophets, and you have given them blood to drink. They are worthy!”	An ulyanelte serce airion ar Erutercánoron, ar ániel tien serce sucien. Nalte valde!”
And I heard the altar say: “Yes, Lord God, the Almighty, true and righteous are your judgments!”	Ar hlassen i yangwa quéta: “Ná, Héru Eru, i Iluvala, şande ar faile nar námielyar!”
And the fourth poured his bowl upon the Sun, and was given to the Sun to burn men with fire.	Ar i cantea ulyane tolporya Anarenna, ar Anaren náne antana urta atani nárnen.
And men were being burned by a great heat, but they cursed the name of God, who had authority over these plagues, and they did not find repentance so as to give him glory.	Ar atani náner urtaine túra úrenen, mal huntelte i esse Eruo, ye sáme hére or ungwaler sine, ar ualte hirne inwis antáven sen alcar.
And the fifth poured his bowl upon the throne of the beast. And its kingdom was in darkness, and people gnawed their tongue because of the pain,	Ar i lempea ulyane tolporya i mahalmanna i hravanwa. Ar aranierya morniesse né, ar queni ñwarner lammalta i ñwalmanen,
but God of heaven they cursed because of their pain and their ulcers, and they did not find repentance concerning their works.	mal Eru menelo huntelte ñwalmaltainen ar sistiltainen, ar ualte hirne inwis pa cardaltar.
And the sixth poured his bowl into the great river Euphrates , and its water became dry, to prepare the way for the kings from sunrise.	Ar i enquea ulyane tolporya mir i hoa síre Perat, ar nénya olle parca, manwien i malle i aranin anarórello.
And I saw three unclean spirits, like frogs, who came out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet.	Ar cennen úpoice fairi nelde, ve quáci, i túler et i antollo i hlóceo, ar et i antollo i hravano, ar et i antollo i hurutercáno.
For they are demon spirits that do signs, and they go forth to the kings of all the world, to gather them for the war on the great day of God Almighty.	An nalte raucofairi i carir tanwali, ar etelendelte i arannar quanda Ambaro, comyáven te i ohtan i túra auresse Eru Iluvalo.
– “Behold! I am coming like a thief! Happy is who keeps himself awake and keeps his garments, that he will not have to walk naked and people will see his humiliation!” –	– “Yé! túlan ve arpo! Valima ná ye hepe inse cuiva ar hepe larmaryar, i ua mauyuva sen vanta helda ar queni cenuvar nucumnierya!” –
And they gathered them in the place which in Hebrew is called Armageddon.	Ar comyaneltet i nómesse ya Heveryasse ná estaina Armahendon.
And the seventh poured his bowl upon air. And a mighty voice came forth from the sanctuary, from the altar, saying: “It has happened!”	Ar i otsea ulyane tolporya vilyanna. Ar taura óma ettúle i yánallo, i mahalmallo, quétala: “Amarties!”
And there were flashes and voices and thunders, and there occurred an earthquake so great that has not occurred a thing of this sort while men have been dwelling on earth – an earthquake so extensive or so great.	Ar enger ítali ar ómali ar hundiéli, ar martane cempalie ta túra i lá amartie síte nat lan Atani amárier cemende – cempalie ta palla hya ta túra.
And the huge city was split into three parts, and the cities of the nations collapsed. God recalled Babylon the Great, and he gave her the cup of the anger of his wrath.	Ar i hoa osto náne hyárina mir rantar nelde, ar atalanter i ostor i nóríva. Eru enyalde Vável Túra, ar sen-antanes i yulma i limpeo i ormeva rúşeryava.
Every island fled, and mountains were no more found.	Ilya tol úşe, ar oronti úner ambe hírine.
Stones of hail, great as talents, fell down from heaven upon the people. But people cursed God because of the plague of hail, for the plague was terrible.	Sarneli helexeva, hoe ve talenti, lantaner undu menello i queninnar. Mal queni hunter Eru i ungwalénen helexeva, an i ungwale rúcima né.
And one of the seven angels that had the seven bowls came and spoke with me, saying: “Come, I will show you the judging of the great harlot who is sitting over many waters,	Ar quén i valion otso i sámer i tolpor otso túle ar quente óni, quétala: “Tula, tanuvan lyen i námie i túra imbacindeva ye hára or rimbe neneli,
with whom kings of earth committed fornication, and those who dwell on earth became drunk by the wine of her fornication.”	as ye cemeno arani hrupuhtaner, ar i marir cemende oller limpunque hrupuhtieryo limpenen.”
And he carried me away in the Spirit into the wilderness. And I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast full of names that were a mockery of God, having seven heads and ten horns.	Ar ni-colles oa i Fairesse mir i ravanda. Ar cennen nís hárala mirucarne hravande quanta ession yar náner yaiwe Eruva, arwa carion otso ar rassion quean.
The woman's garments were purple and scarlet, and she was adorned with gold and jewels and pearls, and in her hand she had a cup of gold full of foul things and the unclean things of her fornication.	I nisso larmar náner luicarni ar mirucarni. ar anes netyana maltanen ar mírínen ar marillainen, ar máryasse sámes yulma maltava quanta şaure nation ar i úpoice nation hrupuhtieryo.
And on her forehead was written a name, a mystery: “Babylon the Great, mother of harlots and the foul things of earth.”	Ar timbareryasse náne técina esse, fóle: “Vável Túra, amil imbacindion ar i şaure nation cemeno.”
And I saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of the holy ones and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus.	Ar cennen in i nís náne limpunqua i sercenen i airion ar i sercenen i vettoron Yésuo.
When I saw her I was in great wonder.	Íre cennenyes anen túra elmendasse.
But the angel said to me: “How that you are in wonder? I will tell you the mystery of the woman and of the beast carrying her and having the seven horns and the ten heads:	Mal i vala quente ninna: “Manen ná i nalye elmendasse? Nyaruvan lyen i fóle i nisso ar i hravano se-cólala ar arwa i carion otso ar i rassion quean:
The beast that you saw was, but is not, and yet it shall rise out of the abyss and go away into destruction. Those who dwell on earth, whose names are not written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world, will be filled with wonder when they see how the beast was, but is not, and yet shall come again.	I hravan ye cennel enge, mal ea lá, ananta ortuvas et i undumello ar menuva oa mir nancarie. I marir cemende, ion essi uar técine i Parmasse Coiviéva tulciello i mardeva, nauvar quátine elmendanen íre cenilte manen i hravan enge, mal ea lá, ananta entuluva.
Here is need for intelligence with wisdom: The seven heads are seven mountains, and on them the woman is sitting. 	Sís ea maure handaléva arwa sailiéno: I cari otso nar oronti otso, ar tais i nís hára.
And there are seven kings: five have fallen, one is now, and the other still has not come, and when he shall come, he will remain a short time.	Ar ear arani otso: lempe alantier, er ea sí, ar i exe en ua utúlie, ar íre tuluvas, lemyuvas şinta lúmesse.
And the beast that was but is not, it is also an eighth king; he comes from the seven and goes away into destruction.	Ar i hravan ye enge mal ea lá, náse yú toltea aran; tulis i otsollo ar lelya oa mir nancarie.
And the ten horns that you saw are ten kings, that still have not received a kingdom, but they do indeed receive authority as kings for a single hour with the beast.	Ar i rassi quean yar cennel nar arani quean, i uar en acámie aranie, mal é camilte hére ve arani erya lúmesse as i hravan.
They have the same thought and give their power and their authority to the beast.	Samilte i imya sanwe ar antar túrelta ar hérelta i hravanen.
They will fight against the Lamb, but since he is Lord of lords and King of Kings, the Lamb will conquer them, with the called and the chosen and the faithful.”	Mahtuvalte i Eulenna, mal pan náse Heru heruion ar Aran aranion, i Eule turúva te, as i yálinar ar cílinar ar vorondar.”
And he says to me: “The waters that you saw, on which the harlot is sitting, are peoples and throngs and nations and tongues.	Ar eques ninna: “I neni yar cennel, yassen hára i imbacinde, nar lier ar şangar ar nóri ar lambi.
And the ten horns that you saw, and the beast – they will hate the harlot and shall make her empty and naked, and her flesh they will eat, and her they will burn with fire.	Ar i rassi quean yar cennel, ar i hravan – tevuvalte i imbacinde ar se-caruvar lusta ar helda, ar hráverya matuvalte, ar sé urtuvalte narnen.
For God put in their hearts to do his will, for them to do a single thought and for them to give their kingdom to the beast, until God’s words are accomplished .	An Eru panyane endaltassen care indómerya, carieltan erya sanwe ar antáveltan aranielta i hravanen, tenna Eruo quettar nar telyane.
And the woman whom you saw is the great city, that has a kingdom over the kings of earth.”	Ar i nís ye cennel i túra osto ná, ya same aranie or i arani cemeno.”
After these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great authority , and earth was being illuminated by his glory.	Apa nati sine cennen hyana vala túla undu menello, arwa túra héreo, ar cemen náne calyaina alcareryanen.
And he cried with a strong voice: “She has fallen! Babylon the Great has fallen, and she has become a haunt of demons and a prison of every unclean bird, and a prison of every unclean and hated beast!	Ar yámes taura ómanen: “Alanties! Alantie Vável Túra, ar olólies vehte raucoron ar mando ilya úpoica aiweo, ar mando ilya úpoica ar tévina hravano!
For of the wine of anger of her fornication all nations have drunk, and the kings of earth committed fornication with her, and the tradesmen of earth became rich by the power of her abundance without bonds!”	An i limpeo ormeva hrupuhtieryo usúcier ilye nóri, ar cemeno arani hrupuhtaner óse, ar cemeno macari oller lárie i túrenen úveryo pen landar!”
And I heard another voice from heaven say: “Go out from her, my people, to stop yourselves from having part with her in her sins and from receiving of her plagues.	Ar hlassen hyana óma et menello quéta: “Á lelya et sello, lienya, pustien inde samiello ranta óse úcareryassen ar camiello ungwaleryon.
For the heap of her sins reaches to heaven, and God has recalled her unrighteous deeds.	An i hahta úcareryaiva rahta menelenna, ar Eru enaiálie úfaile cardaryar.
Give back to her as she gave back, and do to her double of that she has done! Into the cup into which she poured , pour a double measure for her!	Ásen nan-anta tambe ve sé nan-antane, ar cara sen atwa yaron isse acárie! Mir i yulma yanna ulyanes, á ulya atwa lesta issen!
As she gave glory to herself and dwelt in abundance without bounds, so give her torment and grief! For in her heart she says: “I sit a queen, and my husband has not died from me, and I will not ever know grief.”	Síve antanes alcar insen ar marne úvesse pen landar, tambe ásen anta ñwalme ar nyére! An enderyasse quetis: ’Háran tári, ar verunya ua aquálie nillo, ar uan oi istuva naire.’
Therefore her plagues will come in a single day, death and grief and hunger, and she will be burnt with fire, for strong is the Lord God who has judged her!	Etta ungwaleryar tuluvar erya auresse, qualme ar naire ar maitie, ar nauvas urtana nárnen, an polda ná i Héru Eru ye anámie se!
And the kings of earth, who committed fornication with her and dwelt with her in abundance without bonds, will be in tears and will beat themselves because of grief for her, when they look at the reek from her burning .	Ar cemeno arani, i hrupuhtaner óse ar marner óse úvesse pen landar, nauvar níessen ar palpuvar inte nairenen sen, íre yétalte i usque ruiveryallo.
They are standing far away in their fear of her torment and are saying: “Woe, woe, o great city, Babylon the strong city, for in a single hour your judgment has come!”	Táralte hairave caureltanen ñwalmeryava ar quétar: ’Horro, horro, a túra osto, Vável i polda osto, an erya lúmesse námielya utúlie!’
And the tradesmen of earth are in tears and lament her, for now there is nobody to whom they can sell their goods,	Ar cemeno macari nar níessen ar se-nainar, an sí ea úquen yen polilte vace armaltar,
goods like gold and silver and jewels and fine linen and purple and silk and scarlet, and every fragrant wood and every vessel of ivory and every vessel of most precious wood and copper and iron and marble,	armar ve malta ar telpe ar míri ar marillar ar mára páşe ar luicarne ar samin ar mirucarne, ar ilya níşima tavar ar ilya vene mortavarwa ar ilya vene ammaira tavarwa ar urus ar anga ar alas,
and cinnamon and amomum and frankincense and wine and olive oil and fine floor and grain and cows and sheep, and horses and wagons and slaves – living persons.	ar cinnamon ar amomum ar nisque ar níşima millo ar ninquima ar limpe ar piemillo ar mulma ar ore ar yaxir ar mámar, ar roccor ar luncar ar móli – coirie queni.
Indeed the good fruit that was your soul's desire has passed away from you, and all the dainty things and the beautiful things are lost to you, and one will not ever find them again.	É i mára yáve ya náne fealyo íre oantie lyello, ar ilye i netye nati ar i calwe nati nar vanwe lyen, ar mo ua oi enhiruva tai.
The tradesmen trading these things, who were made rich from her, will stand far away in their fear of her torment and will be in tears and shall have grief,	I macari mancala sine nati, i náner cárine lárie sello, taruvar hairave caureltanen ñwalmeryava ar nauvar niessen ar samuvar naire,
saying: ‘Woe, woe – the great city, clad in linen and purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and jewel and pearl,	quétala: ’Horro, horro – i túra osto, vaina mi páşe ar luicarne ar mirucarne, ar netyana maltanen ar mírenen ar marillanen,
for in a single hour riches so great were destroyed!’ 	an erya lúmesse lar ta túra nancarna né!’
And every captain and everyone who travels by ship, and mariners and all who work at sea, stood far away	Ar ilya hesto ar ilquen ye lelya ciryanen, ar ciryamor ar illi i mótar earesse, tarner hairave
and cried when they looked at the reek from her burning and said: ‘Who among cities is like the great city?’	ar yámer íre yentelte i usque ruiveryallo ar quenter: ’Man mici ostor ná ve i túra osto?’
And they threw dust upon their head and cried in tears and grief, and said: ‘Woe, woe – the great city, where all who have ships at sea became rich by her great wealth, for in a single hour she was destroyed!’	Ar hantelte asto careltanna ar yámer mi nier ar naire, ar quenter: ’Horro, horro – i túra osto, yasse illi i samir ciryar earesse oller lárie túra almaryanen, an erya lúmesse anes nancarna!’
Be glad because of her, o heaven and the holy ones and the apostles and the prophets, for because of you God has pronounced judgment against her!”	Na valime issenen, a menel ar i airi ar i aposteli ar i Erutercánor, an eldenen Eru equétie námie senna!”
And a strong angel lifted up a huge mill-stone and threw it into sea, saying: “Thus, quickly, Babylon the Great will be thrown down, and she will not ever be found again.	Ar polda vala ortane haura mulondo ar sa-hante mir ear, quétala: ”Sie, lintave, Vável Túra nauva hátina undu, ar uas oi nauva enhirna.
And the sound of harpers and singers and flutists and trumpeters will by no means be heard in you more, and craftsmen of all crafts will by no means be found in you more, and the sound from a mill-stone will by no means heard in you more,	Ar i lamma ñandaroron ar nyelloron ar simpetarion ar hyólamoron laume nauva hlárina lyesse ambe, ar tanor ilye curwion laume nauvar hírine lyesse ambe, ar i lamma mulondollo laume nauva hlárina lyesse ambe,
and light of a lamp will by no means shine in you more; for your tradesmen were the prominent men of earth, and by your sorcery all nations were caused to err.	ar cala calmo laume caltuva lyesse ambe, ar óma endero hya indisso laume nauva hlárina lyesse ambe; an macarilyar náner i minde neri cemeno, an ñúlelyanen ilye nóri náner tyárine vare.
Furthermore, in her was found the blood of prophets and holy ones and of all who were killed in earth.”	Ente, sesse náne hírina i serce Erutercánólion ar airilion ar illion i náner nahtane cemende.”
After these things I heard that was like a mighty voice of a huge multitude in heaven. They said: “Hallelujah! The salvation and the glory and the power are our God’s,	Apa nati sine hlassen ya né ve taura óma haura rimbeo menelde. Quentelte: “Hallelúya! I rehtie ar i alcar ar i túre nar Ainolvo,
for true and just are his judgments! For he has judged the great harlot who marred the earth with her fornication, and God has avenged his servants’ blood out of her hand.	an şande ar faile nar námieryar! An anámies i túra imbacinde ye hastane cemen hrupuhtieryanen, ar Eru atacárie núroryaron serce et máryallo.”
And the second time they said: “Hallelujah! And the reek from her rises up forever and ever!”	Ar mi attea lú quentelte: “Hallelúya! Ar i usque sello orta ama tennoio ar oi!”
And the four and twenty elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God who was sitting on the throne, and said: “Amen! Hallelujah!”	Ar i amyárar canta yúquean ar i coiti canta lantaner undu ar tyerner Eru i hárane i mahalmasse, ar quenter: “Násie! Hallelúya!”
And a voice came from the throne, saying: “Praise our God, all his servants who fear him, the small and the great!”	Ar óma túle i mahalmallo, quétala: “Á laita Ainolva, ilye núroryar i rucir sello, i pityar yo i túrar!”
And I heard that was like a voice of a huge multitude and like sound of many waters and like the sound of strong thunders, saying: “Hallelujah, for the Lord our God has been made king, the Almighty!	Ar hlassen ya náne ve óma hoa şango ar ve lamma rimbe nenion ar ve lamma polde hundiéron. quétala: “Hallelúya, an i Héru Ainolva anaie carna aran, i Iluvala!
Let us be happy and have joy, and let us give him the glory, for the wedding of the Lamb has come, and his wife has prepared herself.	Alve na valime ar same alasse, ar alve anta sen i alcar, an i Euleo veryanwe utúlie, ar vesserya amanwiexe.
And was given her to be clad in bright, pure linen, for the linen is the righteous deeds of the holy ones.”	Ar náne sen antana náve vaina calima, poica páşesse, an i páşe i faile cardar i airion ná.”
And he tells me: “Write: Happy who are invited to the feast of the wedding of the Lamb!” Furthermore, he said to me: “These are the true words of God.”	Ar nyaris nin: “Teca: Valime i nar tultane i merendenna i veryanweo i Euleo!” Ente, eques ninna: “Sine nar i nanwe quettar Eruo.”
And I fell down before his feet to worship him. But he says to me: “Take heed! Do not do ! I am solely a servant with you and your brothers, who have the witness of Jesus! God you are to worship!” For the witness of Jesus is the spirit of the prophecy.	Ar lantanen undu epe taluryat tyerien se. Mal nyaris nin: “Cima! Áva care! Nanye rie núro as lyé ar hánolyar, i samir i vettie Yésuo! Eru alye tyere!” An i vettie Yésuo ná i apacéno faire.
And I saw heaven opened, and behold! a white horse. And who sat on it was called Faithful and True, and he judges and he fights in righteousness.	Ar cennen menel latyana, ar yé! ninque rocco! Ar ye hamme sesse ná estaina Voronda ar Şanda, ar namis ar mahtas failiesse.
His eyes are like burning fire, and on his head are many diadems. He has a name written that nobody knows except he alone.	Henduryat nát ve uruite ruine, ar caryasse ear rimbe şarnuntali. Samis esse técina ya úquen ista hequa issue erinqua.
He is clad in a cloak dipped in blood, and the name by which he is called is God’s Word.	Náse vaina collasse sumbana sercesse, ar i esse yanen náse estaina Eruo Quetta ná.
Heaven’s armies followed him on white horses and clad in white and pure linen.	Menelo hossi se-hilyaner ninqui roccossen ar vaine mi ninque ar poica páşe.
And from his mouth goes a sharp longsword, with which he will strike nations, and he will rule them with an iron rod. He treads the wine-press of the anger of the wrath of God Almighty.	Ar et antoryallo mene aica andamacil, yanen petuvas nóri, ar tai-turuvas angaina vandilden. Vattas i limpevorma i ormeva i rúşeva Eru Iluvalo.
And on his cloak, on his thigh, he has a name written: King of Kings and Lord of Lords.	Ar collaryasse, tiucoryasse, samis esse técina: Aran Aranion ar Heru Heruion.
And I saw an angel standing in the Sun, and he cried in a mighty voice and said to all birds who fly in the midst of heaven: “Come, gather for God’s great feast,	Ar cennen vala tárala Anaresse, ar yámes taura ómanen ar quente ilye aiwennar i vilir menelo endesse: “Tula, ócoma Eruo túra merendenna,
to eat flesh of kings, flesh of commanders and flesh of strong men, flesh of horses and of who sat on them, the flesh of all, of rich ones and of slaves, of small ones and great ones.	matien hráve aranion, hráve cánoron ar hráve polde nerion, hráve roccoron ar ion hammer tesse, i hráve illion, léraron ar mólion, pityaron yo túraron.”
And I saw the beast and the kings of earth and their armies gathered to make war upon who sat on the horse and upon his army.	Ar cennen i hravan ar cemeno arani ar hosseltar comyane ohtacarien yenna hamme i roccosse ar hosseryanna.
And the beast was seized, and with it the false prophet who did the signs before it, by which it caused to err who received the sign of the beast and worshiped its image. They were both thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulphur.	Ar i hravan náne mapana, ar as sé i hurutercáno ye carne i tanwar epe se, yainen tyarnes vare i camner i tehta i hravano ar tyerner emmarya. Anette yúyo hátine coirie mir i ailin náreva ya urya ussardenen.
The others were killed by the sword that went out of the mouth of who sat upon the horse, and all the birds were filled with their flesh.	I exi náner nahtane i andamacilden ya lende et antollo yeo hamme i roccosse, ar ilye i aiwi náner quátine hráveltanen.
And I saw an angel come down out of heaven having the key to the abyss and a huge chain in his hand.	Ar cennen vala túla undu et menello arwa i latilo i undumeo ar hoa naxa máryasse.
And he took the dragon, the ancient serpent, who is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years.	Ar nampes i hlóce, i yára leuca, ye i Arauco ar Sátan ná, ar avaleryane hé loain húme.
And he threw him into the abyss and closed it and sealed it over him, to stop him from causing nations to stray before the thousand years were passed. After that he will be freed for a short time.	Ar hantes hé mir i undume ar sa-holtane ar sa-lihtane or hé, pustien hé tyariello nóri vare nó i húme loar náner vanwe. Epeta hé nauva leryana şinta lúmen.
And I saw thrones, and were those who sat down on them, and power of judgment was given to them. And I saw the souls of who were slain by axe for witnessing about Jesus and for speaking about God, and of who have not worshipped the beast or its image and have not received the sign on their forehead or their hand. They came to life and ruled with Christ for a thousand years.	Ar cennen mahalmali, ar enger i hamuner tais, ar námotúre náne ten antana. Ar cennen i fear ion náner nahtane pelecconen vettiénen pa Yésus ar quetiénen pa Eru, ar ion uar etyérie i hravan hya emmarya ar uar acámie i tehta timbareltasse hya máltasse. Túlelte coivienna ar turner as Hristo ter i loar húme.
The others of the dead did not come to life before the thousand years were passed. This is the first resurrection.	I exi i qualinaron uar túle coivienna nó i loar húme náner vanwe. Si i minya enortie ná.
Happy and holy is who has a part in the first resurrection. Over them the second death does not have authority, but they shall be priests of God and Christ, and they shall rule with him through the thousand years.	Valima ar aire ná ye same ranta i minya enortiesse. Or té i attea ñuru ua same hére, mal nauvalte airimor Eruo ar Hristo, ar turuvalte óse ter i loar húme.
When the thousand years have passed, Satan will be freed from his prison.	Íre i loar húme avánier, Sátan nauva leryana mandoryallo.
He will go forth to cause to err the nations in the four corners of earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them for the war, countless like the sand of sea.	Etelelyuvas tyarien vare i nóri i vincassen canta cemeno, Cóc yo Mácoc, te-comyáven i ohtan, únótime ve earo litse.
They went up over the broad earth and surrounded the camp of the holy ones and the beloved city. But fire came down from heaven and consumed them.	Lendelte ama olla i palla cemen ar pelder i estolie i airíva ar i melda osto. Mal nár túle undu menello ar te-ammante.
And the Devil who caused them to err was thrown into the lake of fire and sulphur, where both the beast and the false prophet were, and they shall be tormented at day and at night forever.	Ar i Arauco ye tyarne te vare náne hátina mir i ailin nárwa ar ussarneva, yasse yúyo i hravan ar i hurutercáno enget, ar nauvalte ñwalyaine auresse yo lómisse tennoio.
And I saw a great white throne and who sat on it. From his face earth and heaven fled away, and place was not found for them .	Ar cennen túra ninque mahalma ar ye hande sasse. Cendeleryallo cemen yo menel úşet oa, ar nóme úne hírina tún.
I saw also dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Then was opened another book, which is the Book of Life. And dead were judged by the things written in the books, according to their deeds.	Cennen yú qualinar, i túrar yo i pityar, tárala epe i mahalma, ar parmali náner latyane. Tá náne latyana hyana parma, ya i Parma Coiviéva ná. Ar qualinar náner námine i natinen técine i parmassen, ve cardaltar.
And sea gave back the dead in it, and death and Mandos gave back the dead in them, and they were judged, everyone as his deeds were.	Ar ear antane nan i qualinar sasse, ar ñuru ar Mandos antaner nan i qualinar mi tú, ar anelte námine, ilquen ve cardaryar náner.
And death and Mandos were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death: the lake of fire.	Ar ñuru ar Mandos náner hátine mir i ailin nárwa. Si i attea ñuru ná: i ailin nárwa.
And if anyone was not found written in the Book of Life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.	Ar qui aiquen úne hirna técina i Parmasse Coiviéva, anes hátina mir i ailin nárwa.
And I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth were gone, and sea was no more.	Ar cennen vinya menel yo vinya cemen, an i minya menel yo i minya cemen nánet vanwe, ar ear ua ambe enge.
I saw also the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.	Cennen yú i aire osto, Vinya Yerúsalem, túla undu et menello, manwana ve indis netyana veruryan.
And I heard a mighty voice from the throne say: “Behold! The home of God is with Men, and he shall dwell with them, and they shall be his peoples. And God himself shall be with them.	Ar hlassen taura óma i mahalmallo quéta: “Yé! I már Eruva ea as Atani, ar maruvas aselte, ar nauvalte lieryar. Ar Eru immo euva aselte.
He will take away every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more; also grief and outcry and pain will be no more. The former things have passed away.”	Mapuvas oa ilya nie hendultalto, ar ñuru ua ambe euva; yú naire ar rambe ar ñwalma uar ambe euvar. I noe nati avánier.”
And who sat on the throne said: “Behold! I make all things new!” And he says: “Write, for these words are faithful and true!”	Ar ye hande i mahalmasse quente: “Yé! Envinyatan ilye nati!” Ar eques: “Teca, an quettar sine nar voronde ar şande!”
And he said to me: “It is done! I Tinco and Úre , the beginning and the end. To everyone who is thirsty I will give from the spring of the water of life, for nothing.	Ar quentes ninna: “Nas cárina! Inye Tinco ar Úre, i yesse yo i metta. Ilquenen ye soica ná inye antauva i ehtelello i nenwa coiviéva, muntan.
Anyone who conquers shall be heir to these things; I will be his God, and he will be my son.	Aiquen ye turue nauva aryon sine nation; inye nauva Ainorya, ar isse nauva yondonya.
But the cowards and the unbelieving and the disgusting ones and the murderers and the fornicators and those who practice sorcery and worship idols, and all liars – their portion is in the lake burning with fire and sulfur. This is the second death.”	Mal i caurear ar i úsavilar ar i şaurar ar i nehtari ar i hrupuhtandor ar i carir ñúle ar i tyerir cordoni, ar ilye hurindor – masselta ea i ailinde uryala nárnen ar ussarnenen.

One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came to speak with me and said: “Come! I will show you the bride, the Lamb’s wife.”	Quén i valion otso i sámer i tolpor otso quante i métime ungwaleron otso túle quetien óni ar quente: “Tula! Lyen-tanuvan i indis, i Euleo veri.”
By spirit he carried me away to a huge and tall mountain, and he showed me the holy city Jerusalem coming down out of heaven, from God,	Fairenen coldesen oa hoa ar tára orontenna, ar tannes nin i aire osto Yerúsalem túlala undu et menello, Erullo,
and having the glory of God. Its radiance was like a most precious jewel, a jasper shining like glass.	ar samila i alcar Eruo. Ñaltarya ná ve ammaira míre, ve nambíre caltala ve maril.
It had a huge and tall wall and twelve gates, and beside the gates twelve angels, and on the gates were written the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:	Sámes hoa ar tára ramba ar andor yunque, ar ara i andor vali yunque, ar i andossen náner técine i essi i nossion yunque Israelindion:
three gates to East, three gates to North, three gates to south, and three gates to West.	andor nelde Rómenna, andor nelde Formenna, andor nelde Hyarmenna, ar andor nelde Númenna.
And the city wall has twelve foundation stones, and written on them were the names of the apostles of the Lamb.	Ar i ostoramba sáme talmondor yunque, ar técine tais enger i essi i apostelion yunque i Euleo.
And who spoke to me had as a measure a golden rod, for him to be able to measure the city and its gates and its wall.	Ar ye carampe ninna sáme ve lesta maltasirpe, polieryan lesta i osto ar andoryar ar rambarya.
The city is a square, and it is as long as it is wide. And he measured the city with the rod, twelve thousand furlongs; its length and its width and its height are same.	I osto cantil ná, ar nas ve anda ve nás palla. Ar lestanes i osto i sirpenen, restandier húmi yunque; andierya ar pallierya ar tárierya nar imye.
He measured also its wall, a hundred and forty-four cubits, by the measure of man, and also an angel’s.	Lestanes yú rambarya, perrangar canta canaquean ar tuxa, i lestanen atano, ar yú valo.
The wall was made of jasper, and the city was pure gold, like pure glass.	I ramba náne cárina nambíreva, ar i osto náne poica malta, ve poica cilin.
The foundations of the city wall were adorned with every kind of jewels: The first foundation stone was a jasper, the second sapphire, the third agate, the fourth emerald,	I talmar i ostorambo náner netyane ilya nostalénen mírion: I minya talmondo nambíre né, i attea lúle, i neldea ostimmir, i cantea laimaril,
the fifth sardonyx, the sixth sardius, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh hyacinth, and the twelfth amethyst.	i lempea fanorcarne, i enquea culmíre, i otsea malatsar, i toltea elessar, i nertea sinile, i quainea orvamir, i minquea linquemir, ar i yunquea helissar.
Furthermore, the twelve gates were twelve pearls; every gate was one pearl. And the street of the city was pure gold, as transparent glass.	Ente, i andor yunque náner marillar yunque; ilya ando náne er marilla. Ar i osto malle náne poica malta, ve tercénima calca.
And I did not see temple in it, for the Lord God Almighty is its temple, and so is the Lamb.	Ar uan cenne corda sasse, an i Héru Eru Iluvala cordarya ná, ar sie ná i Eule.
The city does not have need of Sun or Moon to shine upon it, for God’s glory illuminated it, and its lamp was the Lamb.	I osto ua same maure Anarwa hya Işilwa caltien sanna, an Eruo alcar sa-calyane, ar calmarya i Eule né.
And nations shall walk by the light from the city, and the kings of earth will bring their glory into it.	Ar nóri vantuvar i calanen i ostollo, ar cemeno arani taluvar alcarelta minna sa.
And its gates will by no means be shut at day, for there will not be night there.	Ar andoryar laume nauvar holtane auresse, an lá euva lóme tasse.
And they shall send the glory and honor of the nations into it.	Ar taluvalte i nórion alcar ar laitie minna sa.
But anything unholy and anybody who practices a disgusting thing and a lie will not come into it, but solely who are written in the book of life of the Lamb.	Mal aiqua úaire ar aiquen ye care şaura nat ar huru ua tuluva minna sa, mal rie i nar técine i parmasse coiviéva i Euleva.
And he showed me a river of the water of life, transparent like crystal, flowing out from the throne of God and of the Lamb,	Ar tannes nin síre i nenwa coiviéva, tercénima ve maril, sirila i mahalmallo Eruva ar i Euleva,
in the midst of the broad street in the city. And to the right and to the left of the river was the Tree of Life that bears fruit twelve times, giving its fruit every month. And the leaves of the Tree were for the healing of nations.	i endesse i palla malleo i ostosse. Ar foryasse ar hyaryasse i síreo enge i Alda Coiviéva ye cole yáve lúr yunque, antala yáverya ilya astasse. Ar i Aldo lassi nar i nestien nóriva.
 will no more be a single thing that is cursed. But God’s throne and the Lamb’s will be there, and his servants will serve him.	Lá ambe euva erya nat ya húna ná. Mal i mahalma Eruva ar i Euleva euva tasse, ar núroryar se-veuyuvar.
They will see his face, and his name will be on their forehead.	Cenuvalte cendelerya, ar esserya euva timbareltasse.
And night will be no more, and they will not have need of light of a lamp or light of Sun, for the Lord God shall illuminate them, and they will rule forever and ever.	Ar lóme lá ambe euva, ar ualte samuva maure calava calmo hya calava Anaro, an i Héru Eru te-calyuva, ar turuvalte tennoio ar oi.
And he said to me: “These words are faithful and true. The Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, has sent his angel to show his servants things that soon will happen.	Ar eques ninna: “Quettar sine nar voronde ar şande. I Héru, i Aino fairion i Erutercánoron, ementaye valarya tanáven núroryain yar ron martuvar.
See! I will come soon! Happy is who heeds the words of the prophecy of this book.”	Yé! tuluvan ron! Valima ná ye cime i quettar i apacéno parma sino.”
And I John was who heard and saw these things. And after hearing and seeing, I fell down to worship before feet of the angel who showed me these things.	Ar inye Yoháno náne ye hlasse ar cenne nati sine. Ar apa hlarie ar cenie, lantanen undu tyerien epe talu i valo ye nin-tanne nati sine.
But he says to me: “Take heed! Do not do ! I am another servant with you and your brothers who are prophets, and with who heed the words of this book! Worship God!”	Mal quetis ninna: ”Cima! Áva care! Nanye hyana núro as lyé ar hánolyar i nar Erutercánor, ar as i cimir i quettar parma sino! Tyera Eru!”
And he says to me: “Do not seal the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is near.	Ar quetis ninna: ”Áva lihta i quettar i apacéno parma sino, an i lúme hare ná.
Let who does unrighteousness, do unrighteousness still; and let the dirty one become dirty still; but let the righteous one do righteousness still, and let the holy one become holy still.	Yen care úfailie lava care úfailie en; ar i váran lava ole vára en; mal lava i failan care failie en, ar lava yen aire ná ole aire en.
Behold! I shall come soon, and what I pay is with me, in order to give back to everyone as his work is.	Yé! Tuluvan ron, ar ya paityan ea asinye, antáven nan ilquenen ve molierya ná.
I Tinco and Úre , the first and the last, the beginning and the end.	Inye Tinco ar Úre, i minya ar i métima, i yesta ar i metta.
Happy are who wash their coats, that they may come to the Tree of Live and go into the city through the gates.	Valime nar i sovir collaltar, i lertuvalte tule i Aldanna Coiviéva ar lelya mir i osto ter i andor.
On the outside are the dogs and those who do magic and the fornicators and the murderers and all who love and practice a lie.	I ettesse ear i huor ar i carir ñúle ar i hrupuhtandor ar i nehtari ar illi i melir ar carir huru.
I Jesus sent my angel to witness to you about these things for the congregations. I am David’s root and seed, and the bright morning star.”	Inye Yésus mentane valanya vettien lyen pa nati sine i ocombin. Inye Laviro şundo ar erde ná, ar i calima arintinwe.”
The Spirit and the bride are saying: “Come!”And let who hears say: “Come!” And let the thirsty one come; let the one who wishes, take the water of life for nothing.	I Faire ar i indis quétar: “Tula!” Ar lava yen hlare quete: “Tula!” Ar lava i soican tule; lava yen mere, mapa i nén coiviéva muntan.
I witness to everyone who hear the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds to these things, God will add to him the plagues about which is written in this book;	Inye vetta ilquenen i hlarir i quettar i apacéno parma sino: Qui aiquen napane sine natinnar, Eru napanuva senna i ungwaler pa yar ná técina parma sinasse;
and if anyone takes anything away from the words of the prophecy of this book, God will take away his part in the Tree of Life and the in the holy city, about which is written in this book.	ar qui aiquen mapa aiqua oa i quettallon i apacéno parma sino, Eru mapuva oa rantarya i Aldasse Coiviéva ar i aire ostosse, pa yar ná técina parma sinasse.
 who bears witness about these things says: “Yes, I shall come soon!” Amen! Come, O Lord Jesus!	Ye vetta pa sine nati quete: “Ná, tuluvan ron!” Násie! Tula, a Heru Yésus!
May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with the holy ones!	Nai i Heru Yésus Hristo lisse euva as i airi!
Paul, thrall of Jesus Christ, called to be apostle, set aside for God's gospel,	Paulo, Yésus Hristo mól, yálina náven apostel, sátina Eruo evandilyonen,
of which he gave promise beforehand through his prophets in the holy scriptures,	pa ya antanes vanda nóvo ter Erutercánoryar i airi tehtelessen,
concerning his Son, who arose from David's seed by the flesh,	pa Yondorya, ye oronte Laviro erdello i hrávenen,
but who was set as the mighty Son of God by the Spirit of holiness, by a raising from dead – Jesus Christ our Lord,	mal ye náne panyana ve i taura Eruion i Fairenen aireva, ortavénen qualinallon – Yésus Hristo Herulva,
through whom we received grace and a place as apostle, to create heeding of the fath among all the nations concerning his name;	ter ye camnelme lisse ar nóme ve apostel, ontien cimie i saviéva mici ilye i nóri pa esserya,
among whom you are called ones of Jesus Christ –	mici yar elde nar Yésus Hristo yálinar –
to all that are in Rome as God's beloved, called to be holy ones: May you have grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.	illinnar i ear Rómesse ve Eruo meldar, yáline náven airi: Nai samuvalde lisse ar raine ho Eru Atarelva ar i Heru Yésus Hristo.
Firstly I give thanks to my God through Jesus Christ concerning all among you, for one talks about your faith in the entire world.	Minyave antan hantale Ainonyan ter Yésus Hristo pa illi mici le, an mo carpa pa savielda i quanda mardesse.
For God, to whom I am a servant with my spirit concerning the gospel of his Son, is my witness about how I without cease name you always in my prayers,	An Eru, yen nanye núro fairenyanen pa Yondoryo evandilyon, astaronya ná pa manen pen hautie estan le illume hyamienyassen,
petitioning that finally, it will be possible for me to come to you, by God's will.	arcala i teldave ecuva nin tule lenna, Eruo indómenen.
For I long to see you, to give you a gift of spirit for you to be firm,	An milyan cene le, antaven len anna faireva náveldan tulce,
or that we exchange comfort, each by the faith of the other, your faith and my faith alike.	hya i quaptalve tiutale, ilquen i exeo saviénen, savielda ar savienya véla.
But my brothers, I do not wish that you are to lack the knowledge that I wanted to come to you on numerous occasions – but I have been hindered until know – to receive a measure of fruit also among you, as among the other non-Jews.	Mal hánonyar, uan mere i penuvalde i istya i mernen tule lenna rimbe lúlissen – mal anaien hampa tenna sí – camien lesta yáveva yú mici le, ve mici i hyane Úyúrar.
To Greeks and to Barbarians alike, to wise ones and to fools I am a debtor.	Hellenyain ar Varvaryain véla, sailain ar aucoin nanye rohtando.
Therefore I burn to make known the gospel also to you who are in Rome.	Etta uryan carien sinwa i evandilyon yú len i ear Rómesse.
For I am not humiliated concerning the gospel, for it is God's power to save everyone who believes, the Jew firstly, then the Greek.	An uan nucumna pa i evandilyon, an nas Eruo túre rehtien ilquen ye save, i Yúra minyave, tá i Hellenya.
For in it God's righteousness is being revealed by faith and into faith, as is written: “But the righteous – by faith he shall have life.”	An sasse Eruo failie ná apantaina saviénen ar mir savie, ve ná técina: “Mal i faila – saviénen coituvas.”
For God's wrath is being revealed from heaven against all godlessness and unrighteousness of men that keep the truth down in an unrighteous manner,	An Eruo rúşe ná apantaina menello ilya ainolórienna ar úfailienna atanion i hepir i nanwie undu mi úfaila lé,
for which one can know about God is made known among them, for God made it known to them.	an ya mo pole ista pa Eru ná carna sinwa mici te, an Eru carne sa sinwa tien.
For his invisible true-being is easily seen from the creation of the world, for they are being perceived by the things made, also his eternal power and divinity. Therefore they cannot defend themselves,	An úcénima nasserya ná aşcénima i ontiello mardeva, an nalte tuntaine i cárine natinen, yú oira túrerya ar valasserya. Etta ualte pole varya inte,
for though they knew God, they did not give him the glory or thanksgiving to which he is worthy as Deity, but their thoughts became empty and darkness filled their unintelligent heart.	an ómu sintelte Eru, ualte antane sen i alcar hya hantale yain náse valda ve Aino, mal sanweltar oller luste ar mornie quante úhanda endalta.
Though they said about themselves that they were wise, they became fools	Ómu quentelte pa inte i anelte saile, ollelte aucor
and turned God Immortal's glory into something like the image of mortal man – and of birds and of beasts and of creeping creatures.	ar querne Eru Ilfirino alcar mir nat ve emma fírima atano – ar aiwion ar lamnion ar hlicila onnaron.
Therefore God gave them over, as the desires of their heart were, to uncleanness that caused the glory of their body to go be lost among themselves,	Etta Eru antane te olla, ve endalto íri náner, úpoicien ya tyarne hroalto alcar auta imíca inte,
they that exchanged God's truth for the lie, and worshiped which was created above who created, who is being blessed forever. Amen!	té i quaptaner Eruo nanwie i hurun, ar tyerner ya náne ontana or ye ontane, ye ná aistaina tennoio. Násie!
Therefore God gave them over to improper lusts, for the women among them exchanged the manner of their nature for a manner beside nature,	Etta Eru antane te olla úmáre mailin, an i nissi mici te quaptaner i lé nasselto lén ara nasse,
and so also the men forsook nature's use of the woman and were kindled with their lust one for the other, men with men, doing what is perverse, and receiving in themselves the reward that they were worthy of because of their error.	and sie yú i neri hehtaner nasseo yuhtie i nisseva ar náner nartane maileltanen quén i exeva, neri as neri, carila ya quarca ná, ar camila intesse i paityale yan anelte valde loimaltanen.
And since is not good in their eyes to have knowledge about God, God gave them over to a worthless mind, for them to do immoral things,	Ar pan úne mára hendultatse same istya pa Eru, Eru antane te olla úmirwa sáman, carieltan úmani nati,
for they were filled will all unrighteousness, wickedness, greed, evil – people full of envy, of murder, of strife, of deceit, of a wicked disposition – whispering,	an anelte quátine ilya úfailiéno, olciéno, milmeo, ulcuo – queni quante hrúceno, nahtiéno, costo, huruleo, olca óreo – hlussala,
speaking evil about others, hating God, violent, haughty, praising themselves, inventing evil things, not heeding parents ,	quetila ulco pa exi, tevila Eru, narace, turquime, laitala inte, autala ulce nati, lá cimila nostaru,
without understanding, breaking their word, unloving, without mercy.	pen hande, racila quettalta, úméle, pen oravie.
Though they know God's decree – that those who do such things are worthy of death – not only do they do them, but they also give their support to those that do them.	Ómu istalte Eruo namna – i té i carir taiti nati nar valde qualmeo – lá rie carilte tai, mal yú antalte penestalta in carir tai.
Therefore you do not have reason to give, every person that judges. For by the thing with which you judge another, you judge yourself evil, since you who judge do the same things.	Etta ualye same casta antaven, ilya quén ye name. An i natanen yanen namil exe, namil imle ulca, pan elye ye name care i imye nati.
But we know, as the truth is, that God's judgement falls upon that do such things.	Mal istalve, ve i nanwie ná, in Eruo namie lanta innar carir taiti nati.
But do you suppose, O man who judges that do such things though you too do them, that you will escape God's judgment?	Mal ma intyal, a atan ye name i carir taiti nati ómu yú elye care tai, in elye uşuva Eruo namie?
Or do you despise the abundance of his gentleness and his forbearance and his patience, since you do not know that God's friendliness is trying to lead you to repentance?	Hya ma nattiril i úve moicieryo ar lavieryo ar cóleryo, pan ual ista in Eruo nildie néva tulya lye inwistenna?
But by your stubbornness and by a heart without repentance you gather for yourself anger on the day of anger, when God's righteous judgements will be revealed.	Mal hrangielyanen ar endanen pen inwis comyal lyen rúşe i auresse rúseva, íre Eruo faile namier nauvar apantane.
And he will give to everyone as his deeds are:	Ar antauvas ilquenen ve cardaryar nar:
eternal life to that seek glory and honor and an immortal state, by steadfastness in a good work,	oira coivie in cestar alcar ar laitie ar ilfirin sóma, voronwiénen mára moliesse,
but to that love strife and do not follow the truth, but follow unrighteousness, will be anger and wrath,	mal in melir cos ar uar hilya i nanwie, ono hilyar úfailie, euvar rúşe ar aha,
persecution and tribulation, upon the soul of every person that does evil, of the Jew first and also that of the Greek;	roitie ar şangie, i feanna ilya queno ye care ulco, i Yúro minyave ar yú i Hellenyo;
but glory and honor and peace to everyone that does good, to the Jew firstly and also to the Greek.	mal alcar ar laitie ar raine ilquenen ye care márie, i Yúran minyave ar yú i Hellenyan.
For God does not heed faces .	An Eru ua cime cendeler.
For those that sinned without law will also be undone without law, but all that sinned under law will be judged by law.	An i úcarner pen şanye yú nauvar nancarne pen şanye, mal illi i úcarner nu şanye nauvar námine şanyenen.
For that hear law are not the just ones before God, but the ones that do law will be made just.	An i hlarir şanye uar i failar epe Eru, mal i carir şanye nauvar cárine faile.
For whenever non-Jews that do not have law by nature do that the law says, these people, though they do not have law, are a law to themselves.	An quiquie Úyúrar i uar same şanye nassenen carir yar i şanye quete, queni sine, ómu ualte same şanye, nar şanye inten.
They show that they have the matters of the law written in their heart, when their conscience witnesses with them and, in their own thoughts, their heart/conscience tells them that they carry guilt or perhaps lack guilt	Tanalte i samilte i şanyeo nattor técine endaltasse, íre immotuntielta vetta aselte ar, vére sanweltassen, ore tien i colilte cáma hya cé penir cáma
– on the day that God judges the secrets of men by the gospel which I have made known, through Jesus Christ.	– i auresse ya Eru name atanion nuldar i evandilyonnen ya inye acárie sinwa, ter Yésus Hristo.
But if you, who are called Jew and rest upon law and praise yourself in God,	Mal qui elye, ye estaina Yúra ná ar sere şanyenna ar laita imle Erusse,
and you know his will and it is possible for you to judge what is good since you have received instruction out of the Law,	ar istal indómerya ar ece lyen name mana mára ná pan acámiel peantie et i Şanyello,
and you are sure that you are leading the blind, a light to that are in darkness,	ar nalye tanca i nalye tulyala i laceníti, cala in nar morniesse,
instructing those lack understanding, a teacher of babes, having the shape of knowledge and of the truth in the Law –	peantala in penir hande, peantar lapsion, arwa i canta istyo ar i nanwiéno i Şanyesse –
you who instruct others, do you not instruct yourself? You who instruct: “Do not steal,” do you steal?	elye ye peanta exin, ma ual peanta imlen? Elye ye peanta: “Áva pile,” ma pilil?
You who say: “Do not break marriage,” do you break marriage? You who say that you abhor idols, do you steal from temples?	Elye ye quete: “Áva race vestale,” ma racil vestale? Elye ye quete i feuyal cordoni, ma pilil cordallon?
You who praise yourself by the Law, do you by your breaking of the Law sully God's glory?	Elye ye laitaxe i Şanyenen, ma racielyanen i Şanyeva vahtal Eruo alcar?
For as has been written: “Because of you God's name is being blasphemed among the nations.”	An ve anaie técina: “Eldenen Eruo esse naiquétaina ná imíca i nóri”.
Indeed circumcision is beneficial if you abide by the Law; but if you break the Law, your circumcision has become lack of circumcision.	É oscirie aşea ná qui himyal i Şanye; mal qui racil i Şanye, oscirielya olólie penie osciriéva.
If, then, a person who is not circumcised keeps the Law's just commandments, will his lack of circumcision not be counted as circumcision?	Qui, tá, quén ye ua oscirna hepe i Şanyeo faile axani, ma penierya osciriéva ua nauva nótina ve oscirie?
For the uncircumcised person who is so by nature, will by adhering to the law judge you who have the written scripture and the circumcision and yet have broken the Law.	Ar i úoscirna quén ye sie ná nassenen, himiénen i Şanye namuva lyé ye same i técina tehtele ar i oscirie ananta arácie i Şanye.
For he is not Jew who is so on the outside; furthermore, circumcision is not that which exists on the outside, in the flesh.	An isse ua Yúra ye sie ná to i etse; ente, oscirie ua ta ya ea to i etse, i hrávesse.
But he is a Jew who is so on the inside, and his circumcision is that of the heart, by spirit and not by the letter. Such a person has his praise, not from men, but from God.	Mal isse ná Yúra ye sie ná i mityasse, ar oscirierya ná ta i endava, fairenen ar lá tengwanen. Taite quén same laitalerya. lá atanillon, mal Erullo.
What, then, is better for the Jew, or what beneficial about the circumcision?	Mana, tá, arya ná i Yúran, hya mana aşea pa i oscirie?
Numerous things, in every manner. Firstly God's words were placed in their keeping.	Rimbe nati, mi ilya lé. Minyave Eruo quettar náner panyane hepieltasse.
Then what? If some persons among them failed to believe, does their lack of belief perhaps make God's faithfulness without power?	Tá mana? Qui ennoli mici te loitaner save, ma penielta saviéva cé care Eruo voronwe pen túre?
By no means! But may God be found faithful, though every man will be found a liar, for is written: “In order to show that you will be made just by your words and you will have victory when you are judged.”	Laume! Mal nai Eru nauva hírina voronwa, ómu ilya atan nauva hírina hurindo, an ná técina: “Tanien i nauval carna faila quettalyainen ar samuval apaire íre nalye námina.”
But if our unrighteousness highlights God's righteousness , what are we to say? Surely God is not unrighteous when he shows his wrath? I am speaking like a man.	Mal qui úfailielva care Eruo failie aşcénima, mana quetuvalve? Lau Eru úfaila ná íre tanas rúşerya? Quétan ve atan.
By no means! In what other manner will God judge the world?	Laume! Mana hyana lénen Eru namuva i mar?
And yet, if by my lie God's truth has become more prominent, to his glory, how is that I am still being judged as a sinner?	Ananta, qui hurunyanen Eruo nanwie olólie ambe minda, alcareryan, manen ná in inye en ná námaina ve úcarindo?
What is to stop us from saying: “Let us to evil things, to bring the good things!” Thusly some blaspheme about us, saying that we do speak so, but such people will receive their just judgment!	Mana vi-pustuva quetiello: “Alve care ulqui, talien i márar!” Sie ennoli naiquetir pa vi, quetila in é carpalve sie, mal taiti queni camuvar faila námielta!
Then what? Are we in a better place ? Not at all! For beforehand we have said about Jews and Greeks alike that all among them are under sin,	Tá mana? Ma nalme arya nómesse? Lau! An nóvo equétielme pa Yúrar ar Hellenyar véla in illi mici te nar nu úcare,
as is written: “ does not exist just man, not one;	ve ná técina: “Lá ea faila atan, lá er;
 is nobody that has insight, is nobody that seeks God, not a single person.	ea úquen ye same tercen, ea úquen ye cesta Eru, lá erya quén.
All have strayed, all together have become worthless , is nobody that does kindness, not a single person.	Illi aránier, illi uo olólier úmirwe; ea úquen ye care moicie, lá erya quén.
Their throat is an open grave; with their tongue they have lied. Venom of snakes is behind their lips ,	Lanculta láta sapsa ná; lambaltanen uhúrielte. Hloire leucaron ea ca péltat,
and their mouth is full of cursing and of bitterness.	ar antolta ná quanta hútiéno ar sáriéno.
Their feet are swift to pour out blood.	Talultat nát linte ulyaven serce.
Ruin and misery are on their ways, and the way of peace they have not known.	Atalante ar angayasse nar tieltassen, ar i tie raineva ualte isintie.
There is no fear of God before their eyes.”	Lá ea rucie Erullo epe hendultat.”
We know that everything that the Law says, it says to that are under the Law, to stop every mouth, and the whole world will be culpable to God, for punishment.	Istalve in ilqua ya i Şanye quete, quetis innar nar nu i Şanye, pustien ilya anto, ar i quanda mar nauva námima Erun, paimen.
Therefore by deeds of law is no flesh which will be made just before him, for by law comes the knowledge of sin.	Etta cardainen şanyeo ua ea hráve ya nauva carna faila epe se, an şanyenen tule i istya úcareva.
But now, without law, God's justness has been shown, as is being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets –	Mal sí, pen şanye, Eruo failie anaie tanana, ve ná vettaina lo i Şanye ar i Erutercánor –
God's justness by faith in Jesus Christ, to all that believe. For no one is better than another,	Eruo failie saviénen Yésus Hristosse, illin i savir. An úquen arya ná lá exe,
since all have sinned and fall short of God's glory.	pan illi úacárier ar loitar Eruo alcar.
As a gift, by his grace, they are made just by the ransom in Jesus Christ,	Ve anna, lisseryanen, nalte cárine faile i nanwerenen Yésus Hristosse,
whom God put as a guilt-offering through faith in his blood. Thus he was going to show us his righteousness, by forgiving the sins that happened in the past	ye Eru panyane ve cámayanca ter savie serceryasse. Sie tanumnes failierya, apseniénen i úcari yar martaner i vanwiesse
while God showed patience, to show his righteousness at the time which is now, to be just also when he pronounces just who is of the faith in Jesus.	lan Eru tanne cóle, tanien failierya i lúmesse ya ea sí, náven faila yú íre quetis faila ye i saviéno Yésusse ná.
Where, then, is the self-praise? is not place for it. By what law? That of acts? No, but by the law of faith.	Masse, tá, i immolaitie ná? Lá ea nóme san. Mana şanyenen? Ta cardaron? Lá, mal i şanyenen saviéva.
For we reckon that man receives righteousness by faith, not by acts of law.	An notilve i atan came failie saviénen, lá cardainen şanyeo.
Or is God only of the Jews? Is he not also the God of people of the nations? Indeed he is also the God of people of the nations,	Hya ma Eru rie i Yúraron ná? Ma uas i Aino yú quenion i nórion? E náse i Aino yú quenion i nórion,
since God is one, who pronounces just the circumcised ones out of faith, and that are not circumcised, by faith.	pan Eru ná er, ye quete faile i oscirnar et saviello, ar i uar oscirne, saviénen.
Do we thusly put away law by our faith? By no means, but we establish law!	Ma sie panyalve oa şanye savielvanen? Laume, mal tulcalve şanye!
What, then, are we to say about Abraham, our father by the flesh?	Mana, tá, quetuvalve pa Avraham, atarelva i hrávenen?
For if Abraham was made just by deeds, he would have been able to praise himself, but not before God.	An au Avraham náne carna faila cardainen, lertiévanes laita inse, mal lá epe Eru.
For what does the Scripture say? “Abraham believed in the Lord, and that was counted to him as justice.”	An mana i Tehtele quete? “Avraham sáve i Hérusse, ar ta náne nótina sen ve failie.”
But to that works the reward is counted, not as grace, but as a debt.	Mal yen mole i paityale ná nótina, lá ve lisse, mal ve rohta.
But to that does not work, but believes in that makes just the godless one, his faith is counted as righteousness.	Mal yen ua mole, mal save yesse care faila i ainolóra, savierya ná nótina ve failie.
Thus David as well says about the joy of the man to whom God accounts righteousness without deeds:	Sie yú Lavir quete pa i alasse i atano yen Eru note failie pen cardar:
“Happy are the people whose lawless deeds are forgiven and whose sins have been covered;	“Valime nar i queni ion şanyelóre cardar nar apsénine ar ion úcari anaier túpine;
happy the person whose sin the Lord does not heed at all.”	valima i quén yeo úcare i Héru laume cimuva.”
Did this joy come to circumcised alone, or also to people that are not circumcised? For we say: “To Abraham his faith was counted as righteousness.”	Ma alasse sina túle rie oscarinnar, hya yú queninnar i uar oscirne? An quetilve: “Avrahámen savierya náne nótina ve failie.”
How, then, was it counted to him? When he was circumcised, or while he was not circumcised? Not while he was circumcised, but while he was not circumcised!	Manen, tá, sa náne nótina? Íre anes oscirna, hya íre únes oscirna? Lá íre anes oscirna, mal íre únes oscirna!
For he received a sign, circumcision, as a seal of righteousness by the faith that he had while he still was not circumcised, for him to be father of all that have faith without circumcision, to cause righteousness to be counted to them,	Ar camnes tanwa, oscirie, ve lihta failiéno i saviénen ya sámes íre en únes oscirna, náveryan atar illion i sámer savie pen oscirie, tyarien failie náve nótina tien,
and also father of circumcized ones, not only to those that adhere to circumcision, but also to those that follow Abraham our father in the path of faith in which he walked before he was circumcised.	ar yú atar oscirnaron, lá rie in himyar oscirie, mal yú in hilyar Avraham atarelva i tiesse saviéno yasse vantanes nó anes oscirna.
For not by the Law Abraham or his seed has the promise about becoming heir to a world, but through the righteousness by faith.	An lá Şanyenen Avraham hya erderya same i vanda pa olie aryon mardo, mal ter i failie saviénen.
For if those that adhere to law are heirs, faith has become empty and the promise has been abandoned.	An au i himyar şanye nar aryoni, savie olólie lusta ar i vanda anaie hehtana.
For the law causes anger, but where does not exist law, also does not exist crime.	An i Şanye tyare rúşe, mal yasse lá ea şanye, yú lá ea ongwe.
Thus the promise is by faith, for it to be by grace, to make it firm for all the seed of Abraham, not only that which adheres to the Law, but also that which adheres to Abraham's faith. He is the father of all among us,	Sie i vanda saviénen ná, náveryan Erulissenen, carien sa tanca ilya erden Avrahámo, lá rie ta ya himya i Şanye, mal yú ta ya himya Avrahámo savie. Náse i atar illion mici vi,
as has been written: “I have put you father of numerous nations” – before God in whom he believed, who makes the dead alive and calls the things that do not exist as if they existed.	ve anaie técina: “Apánien lye atar rimbe nórion” – epe Eru yesse sáves, ye care i qualinar coirie ar yalir i nati yar lá ear ve au engelte.
Beyond hope by hope he had faith of being father of numerous nations, as was said: “So your seed will be.”	Estel pella estelden sámes savie náveo atar rimbe nórion, ve náne quétina: “Sie nauva erdelya.”
And though his faith did not fade, he noticed his own body, which was like dead when he was close to a hundred years, and he also perceived how dead Sarah's womb was.	Ar ómu savierya ua firne, túnes véra hroarya, ya náne ve qualina íre anes hare loannar tuxa, ar yú tunes manen qualin Saro móna né.
But by God's promise he did not falter in lack of faith, but he was made mighty by his faith,	Mal Eruo vandanen uas talante peniesse saviéva, mal náne carna taura savieryanen,
and he was certain that he who gave the promise also had the power to do as he said.	ar anes tanca in isse ye antane i vanda yú sáme i túre carien ve hé quente.
Therefore that was “counted to him as righteousness”.	Etta ta náne “nótina sen ve failie”.
It was not written about him alone that that was counted to him,	Úne técina pa sé erinqua i ta náne nótina sen,
but also about us. It will be counted to us – to the people who believe in him that raised Jesus our Lord from dead.	mal yú pa elve. Nauvas nótina elven – i quenin i savilve sesse ye ortane Yésus Herulva qualinallon.
He was given over because of our crimes and was raised for us to be pronounced just.	Hé náne antana olla ongwelvainen ar náne ortana návelvan quétine faile.
Therefore, since we have been pronounced just by faith, may we have peace with God, by Jesus Christ our Lord.	Etta, pan anaielve quétine faile saviénen, nai samuvalve raine as Eru, Yésus Hristo Herulvanen.
Through him we also have a gate of faith leading to the grace in which we now stand; and may we praise ourselves as concerns the hope of the glory of God.	Ter hé yú samilve ando saviéva tulyala i Erulissenna yasse sí tarilve; ar nai laituvalve inwe pa i estel alcaro Eruo.
Indeed not only that, but may we also praise ourselves concerning the persecutions, knowing that persecution gives endurance,	É lá rie ta, mal nai yú laituvalve inwe pa i roitier, istala i roitie anta voronwie,
endurance leads to a tested condition, and a tested condition gives hope.	voronwie tulya tyastana sómanna, ar tyastana sóma anta estel.
And the hope will not fail, for God's love has been poured out into our heart by the Holy Spirit that was given to us.	Ar i estel ua loituva, an Eruo melme anaie ulyana mir endalva i Aire Feanen ya náne antana ven.
For indeed Christ, when we were still weak, died for godless men when the time came.	An é Hristo, íre en anelve milye, qualle ainolóre atanin íre i lúme túle.
For one does not quickly choose to die even for a person who is just – or maybe one indeed dares to die for a person who is good.	An mo ua lintave cile quale yando quenen ye faila ná – hya cé mo é verya quale quenen ye mane ná.
But God shows us his love in this manner, that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.	Mal Eru tana ven melmerya lé sinasse, i lan en anelve úcarindor, Hristo qualle ven.
Since we have been made righteous by his blood, that much more we shall be saved by him from the wrath.	Pan anaielve cárine faile serceryanen, ta ita ambe nauvalve rehtane issenen i rúşello.
For if, when we were enemies, peace was established between us and God by the death of his Son, that much more we shall be saved by his life now that we have peace with him.	An qui, íre anelve ñottor, raine náne tulcana imbi vi ar Eru i qualmenen Yondoryo, ta ita ambe nauvalve rehtane coivieryanen sí íre samilve raine óse.
And not just that, but we also bless ourselves in God, through Jesus Christ our Lord, through whom peace has now been established for us.	Ar lá rie ta, mal yú laitalvexer Erusse, ter Yésus Hristo Herulva, ter ye raine sí anaie tulcana ven.
For sin existed in the world before the Law, but sin is not counted against anyone when does not exist law.	An úcare enge i mardesse nó i Şanye, mal úcare ua nótina aiquenna íre lá ea şanye.
And yet death had power from Adam until Moses, also over the ones that did not sin in the manner of the crime of Adam, who is an image of that was going to come.	Ananta qualme sáme túre Atanello tenna Móses, yú or i uar úcarner mí lé ongweo Atano, ye ná emma yeo tulumne.
But the matter of the crime is not like the matter of the gift. For though numerous ones died by one person's crime, the grace of God and the gift by the grace of one person – Jesus Christ – were much more abundant to numerous ones.	Mal natto i ongweo ua ve natto i anno. An ómu rimbali qualler er queno ongwenen, i lisse Eruo ar i anna i lissenen er queno – Yésus Hristo – náner ita ambe úvie rimbalin.
Furthermore, matter of the gift is not like the matter of that sinned. For the doom following a single crime brought a judgement of guilt, but the gift following many crimes leads to being made just.	Ente, i anno natto ua ve i natto yeo úcarne. An i anan hilyala erya ongwe talle namie cámava, mal i anna hilyala rimbe ongwi tulya návenna carna faila.
For if by the one person's crime death had power by him, much more that receive the abundance of his grace and the gift of righteousness will rule through that one person – Jesus Christ.	An qui i er queno ongwenen qualme sáme túre issenen, ita ambe i camir lisseryo úve ar i anna failiéva turuvar ter sana er quén – Yésus Hristo.
For as by one crime all men were judged evil, in the same manner by one righteous deed all men are said just, to life.	An ve er ongwenen ilye atani náner námine ulce, mi imya lé er faila cardanen ilye atani nar quétine faile, coivien.
For like numerous ones were made sinners since a single man broke the commands, so numerous ones are also made just since a single person heeded them.	An síve rimbali náner cárine úcarindor pan erya nér rance i canwar, tambe rimbali yú nauvar cárine faile pan erya quén cimne tai.
But the Law came to make crime abundant. However, where sin was abundant, grace was still more abundant.	Mal i Şanye túle carien ongwe úvea. Ono yasse úcare úvea né, Erulisse náne en ambe úvea.
The purpose was that as sin ruled by death, so grace was going to rule by righteousness, bringing eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.	I enne náne i sive úcare turne qualmenen, tambe Erulisse turumne failiénen, tálala oira coivie Yésus Hristo Herulvanen.
What, then, are we to say? Are we to remain in sin, to make grace abundant?	Mana, tá, quetuvalve? Ma lemyuvalve úcaresse, carien Erulisse úvea?
By no means! We that died concerning sin, how will we still live in it?	Laume! Elve i qualler pa úcare, manen en coituvalve sasse?
Or do you not know that all among us that were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?	Hya ualde ista in illi mici vi i náner sumbane mir Hristo Yésus náner sumbane mir qualmerya?
Therefore we were put in a grave with him by his baptism. Thus, like also the Christ was raised from dead by the glory of the Father, also we were going to walk in a new life.	Etta anelve panyane sapsasse óse sumbieryanen. Sie, ve yú i Hristo náne ortana qualinallon i Ataro alcarnen, yú elve vantumner vinya coiviesse.
And if we have come together with him in a death like his death, we shall also be with him in a resurrection like his resurrection.	An qui utúlielve uo óse qualmesse ve qualmerya, yú nauvalve óse enortavesse ve enortaverya.
For we know that our old man was crucified with him, to put away the body of sin, to stop us from being thralls under sin.	An istalve i yára atanelva náne tarwestana óse, panien oa i hroa úcareva, vi-pustien návello móli nu úcare.
For who has died has been freed from sin.	An ye aquálie anaie leryana úcarello.
Furthermore, if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him.	Ente, qui aquálielve as Hristo, savilve i yú coituvalve óse.
For we know that now, when the Christ has been raised from dead, he does not die again; death does not more have power over him.	An istalve i sí, íre i Hristo anaie ortana qualinallon, uas quale ata; qualme ua ambe same túre or se.
For the death that he died, he died concerning sin a single time and forever, but the life that he lives, he lives for God.	An i qualme ya qualles, qualles pa úcare erya lú ar tennoio, mal i coivie ya coitas, coitas Erun.
In the same manner also you: count yourselves as dead to sin, but as living to God, in Christ Jesus.	Mi imya lé yú elde: nota inde ve qualine úcaren, mal ve coirie Erun, mi Hristo Yésus.
Therefore do not let sin rule your mortal body, for you to behave by its desires.	Etta áva lave úcaren ture fírima hroalda, lengieldan íreryainen.
Furthermore, do not give your members to sin as weapons of unrighteousness, but give yourselves to God as the living ones from dead, also your members to God as weapons of righteousness.	Ente, áva anta hroarantaldar úcaren ve carmar úfailiéva, mal á anta inde Erun ve i coirear qualinallon, yú hroarantaldar Erun ve carmar failiéva.
For sin will not rule you, for you are not under law, but under grace.	An úcare ua le-turuva, an ualde nu şanye, mal nu Erulisse.
What follows? Are we to sin, since we are not under law, but under grace? By no means!	Mana hilya? Ma úcaruvalve, pan ualve nu şanye, mal nu Erulisse? Laume!
Do you not know that if you give yourselves to anyone as thralls, to do what he says, you are his thralls since you do what he says – perhaps thralls of sin, leading to death, perhaps thralls of obedience , leading to righteousness.	Ma ualde ista i qui antalde inde aiquenen ve móli, carien ya quetis, nalde móliryar pan carilde ya quetis – cé úcareo móli, tulyala qualmenna, cé canwacimiéno móli, tulyala failienna.
But thanks be to God: You were thralls of sin, but you sincerely heeded the kind of instruction to which you were given over.	Mal na hantale Erun: Anelde móli úcareo, mal cimnelde holmo i nostale peantiéva yan anelde antane olla.
After you were freed from sin, you became thralls of righteousness.	Apa anelde leryane úcarello, ollelde móli failiéno.
I speak to you in the manner of Men, since your flesh is weak. For like you made your body-parts thralls of uncleanness and lawbreaking, which led to more lawbreaking, now set your body-parts as thralls of righteousness, which will lead to holiness.	Carpan lenna mi lé Atanion, pan hrávelda milya ná. An ve carnelde hroarantaldar móli úpoiciéno ar şanyeraciéno, ya tulyane amba şanyeracienna, sí á panya hroarantaldar ve móli failiéno, ya tulyuva airenna.
For when you were thralls of sin, you were free concerning righteousness.	An íre anelde móli úcareo, anelde lére pa failie.
But what was the fruit that you then had? Things of which you are now humiliated , for the end of those things is death!	Mal mana náne i yáve ya tá sámelde? Nati pa yar nalde sí nucumne, an i metta tane nation qualme ná!
But now, since you were freed from sin but have become servants to God, you have your fruit leading to holiness, and the end will be eternal wife.	Ono sí, pan anelve leryane úcarello mal olólier móli Erun, samilde yávelda tulyala airenna, ar i metta nauva oira coivie.
For what sin pays is death, but God's gift is eternal life, in Christ Jesus our Lord.	An ya úcare paitya qualme ná, mal Eruo anna oira coivie ná, mi Hristo Yésus Herulva.
Or do you not know, my brothers – for I speak to that know law – that the Law rules as lord over a man though the entire time that he lives?	Hya ualde ista, hánonyar – an quetin innar istar şanye – in i Şanye ture ve heru or atan ter i quanda lúme ya coitas?
For a woman who has gotten married to a man is bound to her husband while the man is alive, but if her husband dies, the woman is freed from the law of the husband.	An nís ye evérie nerenna ná nútina veruryanna lan i nér coirea ná, mal qui verurya quale, i nís ná lehtana i veruo şanyello.
Thus, then, while her husband is alive, one was going to say that the woman has broken marriage if she gave herself to another man. But if her husband dies, she is free from the law, and she does not break marriage if she gets married to another man.	Sie, tá, lan verurya coirea ná, mo quetumne in i nís arácie vestale qui antanesexe hyana neren. Mal qui verurya quale, náse léra i şanyello, ar uas race vestale qui veryas hyana nerenna.
Thus, my brothers, you as well became dead to the Law by the body of Christ, for you to be another's, he who was raised from dead, for us to bear fruit to God.	Sie, hánonyar, yú elde oller qualine i Şanyen i Hristo hroanen, náveldan exeo, isse ye náne ortana qualinallon, colielvan yáve Erun.
For when we were in the flesh, the lusts of sin which were being strirred by the Law worked in our body-parts, causing us to bear fruit to death.	An íre anelve i hrávesse, úcareo mailer yar náner valtaine i Şanyenen móler hroarantalvassen, vi-tyarila cole yáve qualmen.
But now we have been freed from the Law, since we have died from that with which we were bound, for us to be servants in a new manner, by the spirit, and not in the old manner, by letters.	Mal sí anaielve lertane i Şanyello, pan aquálielve ho ta yanen anelve nútine, návelvan núroli mi vinya lé, i fairenen, ar lá mí yára lé, tengwainen.
What, then, are we to say? The Law is sin? By no means! But sin I did not know if not by the Law. For greed I did not now if the Law did not say: “Do not be greedy!”	Mana, tá, quetuvalve? I Şanye úcare ná? Laume! Mal úcare uan sinte qui lá i Şanyenen. An milcie uan sinte au i Şanye ua quente: “Áva na milca!”
But sin, having an opportunity by the commandment, created in me greed of every kind, for away from law sin was dead.	Mal úcare, arwa eciéno i axannen, ontane inyesse milcie ilya nostaleo, an oa şanyello úcare qualina né.
Indeed was a time in which I was alive away from law, but when the commandment came, sin returned to life, but I died.	É enge lúme yasse anen coirea oa şanyello, mal íre i axan túle, úcare nanwenne coivienna, mal inye qualle.
For the commandment which was for life, that I found was for death.	Ar i axan ya náne coivien, ta hirnen náne qualmen.
For sin, when it received an opportunity by the commandment, seduced me and killed me by it.	An úcare, íre camnes ecie i axannen, ni-şahtane ar ni-nacante sánen.
Therefore the Law is holy, and the commandment holy and righteous and good.	Etta i Şanye aire ná, ar i axan aire ar faila ar mára.
Did that which was good cause death to me? By no means! But sin did so, causing death in me by which is good, to reveal what sin really is , and for it to be sinful beyond measure by the commandment.	Ma ya mára né tyarne nin qualme? Laume! Mal úcare carne sie, tyarila qualme nisse yanen mára ná, apantien úcareo nasse, ar náveryan úcarunqua han lesta i axannen.
For as we know, the Law is of the Spirit, but I am of the flesh, sold under sin.	An ve istalve, i Şanye i Faireo ná, mal inye i hráveo ná, vácina nu úcarenna.
For what I work I do not understand. For which I wish, that I do not do, but which I hate, that is what I do.	An ya molin uan hanya. An ya merin, ta uan care, mal ya tevin, ta ná ya carin.
But if which I do not want is what I do, I assent with the Law that is it good.	Ono qui ya uan mere ná ya carin, náquetin as i Şanye i nas mára.
But now who works it is no more I, but sin which dwells in me.	Mal sí ye mole sa ua ambe ní, mal úcare ya mare nisse.
For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwells nothing good; for it is possible for me to desire, but it is not possible for me to work which is good.	An istan in inyesse, ta ná, hrávenyasse, mare munta mára; an ece nin mere, mal ua ece nin mole ya mára ná.
For the good that I want I do not do, but the evil that I do not want, that I do.	An i márie ya merin uan care, mal i ulco ya uan mere, ta carin.
But if which I do not want is what I do, who does it is no more I, but sin dwelling in me.	Mal qui ya inye ua mere ná ya carin, ye care sa ua ambe ní, mal úcare márala nisse.
This I find that exists this law: When I wish to do what is proper, evil lies near to me.	Sie hirin in ea şanye sina: Íre merin care ya vanima ná, ulco caita hare ninna.
Indeed I have joy in God's Law by my inner man,	É samin alasse Eruo Şanyesse mitya ataninyanen,
but I see in my body-parts another law making war against my mind and making me a slave to the law of sin which exists in my body-parts.	mal cenin hroarantanyassen hyana şanye ohtacarila sámanyanna ar ni-carila mól şanyen úcareo ya ea mi hroarantanyar.
Miserable man that I am! Who will save me from this body of death?	Angayanda nér ye nanye! Man ni-rehtuva sina hroallo qualmeva?
Thanks to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! Indeed I am a slave of the law of God by my mind, but by my flesh, of the law of sin.	Hantale Erun ter Yésus Hristo Herulva! É inye ná mól i şanyeo Eruo sámanyanen, mal hrávenyanen, i şanyeo úcareo.
Thus that are in Christ Jesus will not be judged evil.	Sie i nar mi Hristo Yésus lá nauvar námine ulce.
For the law of the spirit which gives life in Christ Jesus has freed you from the law of sin and of death.	An i faireo şanye ya anta coivie mi Hristo Yésus eleryanie lye i şanyello úcareva ar qualmeva.
For what the Law could not do, since it was weak by the flesh, God did by sending his own Son in which was similar to sinful flesh, and concerning sin. He judged sin evil in the flesh.	An ya i Şanye ua polle care, pan anes milya i hrávenen, Eru carne mentavénen véra Yondorya mi ya náne vávea úcarunqua hráveo, ar pa úcare. Namnes úcare ulca i hrávesse.
Thus the just command of the Law could become real in us that walk, not by the flesh, but by the Holy Spirit.	Sie i Şanyeo faila axan polle ole nanwa elvesse i vantar, lá i hrávenen, mal i Aire Feanen.
For that are of the flesh heed the matters of the flesh, but that are of the spirit, the matters of the spirit.	An i nar i hráveo cimir i hráveo nattor, mal i nar i faireo, i faireo nattor.
To heed the flesh brings death, but to heed the spirit brings life and peace,	Cime i hráve tala qualme, mal cime i faire tala coivie ar raine,
for who heeds the flesh is hostile to God, for the flesh does not bow to God's law; indeed that is not possible for it.	an ye cime i hráve ná cotya Erun, an i hráve ua luhta Eruo şanyen; é ta ua ece san.
Therefore that are in the flesh are not able to please God.	Etta i nar i hrávesse uar pole fasta Eru.
But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if God's spirit dwells in you. But if anyone does not have the Christ's spirit, he is not his .	Mal elde uar i hrávesse, mal i fairesse, qui Eruo faire mare lesse. Mal qui aiquen ua same i Hristo faire, isse ua senya.
But if the Christ exists in you, the body is indeed dead, by sin, but the spirit is life, by justness.	Mal qui i Hristo ea lesse, i hroa é qualina ná, úcarenen, mal i faire coivie ná, failiénen.
If the spirit of that raised Jesus from dead dwells in you, who raised Christ Jesus the dead will also made your mortal bodies alive, by his spirit that dwells in you.	Qui i faire yeo ortane Yésus qualinallon mare lesse, ye ortane Hristo Yésus qualinallon yú caruva fírime hroaldar coirie, faireryanen ya mare lesse.
Therefore, brothers, we are indeed debtors, but not to the flesh, in order to live by the flesh.	Etta, hánor, é nalve rohtalie, mal lá i hráven, coitien i hrávenen.
For if you live by the flesh, you will die, but if by the spirit you kill the deeds of your body,, you will live.	An qui coitalde i hrávenen, qualuvalde, mal qui i fairenen nahtalde hroaldo cardar, coituvalde.
For all that are being led by God's spirit, they are God's sons.	An illi i nar tulyaine lo Eruo faire, té nar Eruo yondor.
For you did not receive a thrall's spirit, again causing fear, but you received a spirit of being chosen as sons, the spirit by which we cry: “Abba, Father!”	An ualde came mólo faire, ata tyarila caure, mal camnelde faire náveva cíline ve yondor, i faire yanen yamilve: “Appa, Atar!”
The spirit itself is a witness with our spirit that we are God's children.	I faire imma astaro ná as fairelva i nalve Eruhíni.
And if we are children, we are also heirs – indeed God's heirs, and heirs with the Christ, if we suffer with him, for us to receive also glory with him.	Ar qui nalve híni, nalve yú aryoni – é aryoni Eruo, mal aryoni as i Hristo, qui perperilve óse, camielvan yú alcar óse.
Therefore I count the sufferings of this time as nothing compared to the glory that will be revealed in us.	Etta notin i perperier lúme sino ve munta sestane as i alcar ya nauva apantana elvesse.
For with a burning desire Creation looks forward to the revealing of God's sons.	An uryala írenen Ontie yéta ompa i apantienna Eruo yondoiva.
For Creation was put under an useless state, not by its own will but by who put it under that, although having a hope:	An Ontie náne panyana nu úaşea sóma, lá véra şelmaryanen mal lo ye panyane sa nu ta, ómu arwa estelo:
that also creation itself will be freed from being a thrall of corruption into the glorious freedom of God's children.	i yú Ontie imma nauva leryana návello mól hastiéno mir i alcarinqua lérie Eruhínion.
For we know how the entire creation is groaning together and is in pain together until now.	An istalve manen i quanda Ontie ñónea uo ar ea naicesse uo tenna sí.
Not only that, but also we who have the first fruit – that is, the Spirit – we groan in ourselves, when we look forward to being chosen as sons – the release from our body by ransom.	Lá rie ta, mal yú elve i samir i minye yáve – ta ná, i Faire – elve ñonar inwesse, íre yétalve ompa návenna cíline ve yondor – i lehtie hroalvallo nanwerenen.
For we were saved in this hope; but a hope that one sees is not hope, for when a person sees a thing, how does he have hope for it?	An anelve rehtane estel sinasse; mal estel ya mo cene ua estel, an íre quén cene nat, manen samis estel san?
But if we have hope for that which we do not see, we are looking forward to it with endurance.	Mal qui samilve estel yan ualve cene, yétalve ompa sanna voronwiénen.
In the same manner the Spirit also helps us when we are weak. We do not know what we would do well by requesting it, but the Spirit itself petitions for us, with unutterable words.	Mí imya lé i Faire yú vi-manya íre nalve milye. Ualve ista mana carumnelve mai arciénen sa, mal i Faire imma arca ven, alaquétime quettainen.
But he who searches the hearts know what the thought of the Spirit is, since by God's will it makes request for the holy ones.	Mal ye cesta i endar ista mana i Faireo sanwe ná, pan Eruo şelmanen arcas i airin.
We know that God causes all things to work together for who love God, for their good – the that are called for his purpose.	Istalve in Eru tyare ilye nati mole uo in melir Eru, márieltan – i nar yáline enneryan.
For the ones that he knew beforhand he also chose beforehand, for them to be fashioned according to the image of his Son, making him the first-born among numerous brothers;	An té i sintes nóvo yú cildes nóvo, náveltan cátine ve i emma Yondoryo, carila sé i minnóna mici rimbe hánor;
but the ones that he chose beforehand, he also called, and the ones that he called, he also made righteous, and those that he made righteous, he also made glorious.	mal té i cildes nóvo, yú yaldes, ar té i yaldes, yú carnes faile, ar té i carnes faile, yú carnes alcarinque.
What, then, am I to say about these things? If God is with us, who will stand against us?	Mana, tá, quetuvan pa nati sine? Qui Eru ea aselve, man taruva venna?
 who did not have mercy even his own Son but gave him over for the good of all among us, how is that he will not give us all other things?	Ye ua oráve yando véra Yondoryasse mal antane se olla i márien illion mici ve, manen ná i uas yú antauva ven ilye hyane nati?
Who will speak evil against that God as chosen? God is who has spoken them just;	Man quetuva ulco innar Eru icílie? Eru ná ye equétie te faile;
who is that judge them evil? Christ Jesus is who died, or better, he is who was raised from the dead, who is at God's right hand, who also makes petition for us.	man ná ye name te ulce? Hristo Yésus ná ye qualle; hya arya, náse ye náne ortana qualinallon, ye ea Eruo formasse, ye yú arca ven.
Who will take us away from the love of the Christ? Will tribulation or pressure or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword do so?	Man vi-mapuva oa i Hristo melmello? Ma şangie hya şahtie hya roitie hya saicele hya heldie hya raxe hya macil caruva sie?
As has been written: “Because of you we are being slain throughout the whole day; we have been counted as sheep for slaughter.”	Ve anaie técina: “Elyenen nalme nahtaine ter i quanda aure; anaielme nótine ve mámar nahtien.”
But in all these things we have the victory, by that loved us.	Ono mi ilye sine nati samilve i apaire, yenen méle vi.
For I am sure that nothing – death or life or angels or lordships, or that are now or that will come, or powers,	An nanye tanca i munta – qualme hya coivie hya valar hya héri hya yar ear sí hya yar tuluvar, hya túri,
or depth or every other created thing – will be able to take us away from God's love which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.	hya tumnie hya ilya hyana ontana nat – poluva vi-mapa oa Eruo melmello ya ea mi Hristo Yésus Herulva.
The truth I am telling in Christ – I am not lying, since my conscience is my witness with me, in the Holy Spirit –	I nanwie nyáran i Hristosse – uan húra, pan immotuntienya astarmonya ná asinye, i Aire Feasse –
that I have a great grief and a lingering pain in my heart.	i samin túra naire ar lemyala naice endanyasse.
For it is possible for me to wish that I were cut off as accursed from the Christ for the good of my brothers, my kin by the flesh,	An ece nin mere in inye náne aucirna ve húna i Hristollo márien hánonyaron, nossenya i hrávenen,
who are Israelites, who were chosen as children and have the glory and the covenants and the giving of the Law and the service and the promises,	i nar Israelyar, i náner cíline ve híni ar samir i alcar ar i véri ar i antave i Şanyeva ar i núromolie ar i vandar,
they that have the fathers and from whom the Christ has his descent by the flesh. May God, who is above all, be blessed forever! Amen!	té i samir i atari ar illon i Hristo same ontalerya i hrávenen. Nai Eru, ye or illi ea, nauva aistana tennoio! Násie!
But the matter is not as if God's word has failed. For not all that have their descent from Israel are truly Israel.	Mal i natto ua ve au Eruo quetta oloitie. An lá illi i samir ontalelta Israello nar nanwave Israel.
Furthermore, all among them are not children by being Abraham's seed, but: “What will be called your seed will come through Isaac.”	Ente, illi mici te uar híni návenen Avrahámo erde, mal: “Ya nauva estaina erdelya tuluva ter Ísac.”
That is, the children in the flesh are not truly God's children, but the children that exist by the promise are being counted as the seed.	Ta ná, i híni i hrávesse uar nanwave Eruo híni, mal i híni i ear i vandanen nar nótaine ve i erde.
For the word of promise was thus: “At this time I shall return, and will be a son with Sarah.”	An i quetta vando sie né: “Lúme sinasse nanwenuvan, ar euva yondo as Sara.”
And yet not only in that matter: The same happened when Rebecca begat twins by the same man, Isaac our father.	Ananta lá rie mi tana natto: I imya martane íre Revecca óne onóni i imya nernen, Ísac atarelva.
For when they still were not born, and before they did good or evil – to make God's purpose concerning the choice depend, not on deeds, but on who calls –	An íre en uatte nóne, ar uatte acárie márie hya ulco – tyarien Eruo enne pa i cilme linga, lá cardassen, mal yesse yale –
it was said to her: “The oldest will be a thrall to the youngest.”	náne quétina senna: “I amyára nauva mól i amnessan.”
Just as is written: “I loved Jacob, but Esau I hated.”	Aqua ve ná técina: “Mélen Yácov, mal Ésau téven.”
Then what are we to say? Is there unrighteousness with God? By no means!	Tá mana quatuvalve? Ma ea úfailie as Eru? Laume!
For he says to Moses: “I will have mercy on whom I shall have mercy, and I will show sympathy to whom I shall show sympathy.”	An quetis Mósenna: “Oravuvan yesse oravuvan, ar tanuvan ofelme yen tanuvan ofelme!”
Therefore the matter hangs, not on who wishes or on that runs, but on Gods who shows mercy.	Etta i natto linga, lá yesse mere hya yesse nore, mal Erusse ye órave.
For the Scripture says to Pharaoh:“For this purpose I have allowed you to remain, that in you I will show my power, and to make my name known on the entire earth.”	An i Tehtele quete Fáronna: “Sina ennen alávien lyen lemya, i lyesse tanuvan túrenya, ar carien essenya sinwa i quanda cemende.”
Thus he indeed shows mercy on he shows mercy, but whom he wishes he makes hard.	Sie é óravas yesse óravas, mal ye meris caris tarya.
Therefore you will say to me: “How is that he still says that anyone has guilt? For who has been able to stand against his will?”	Etta quetuval ninna: “Manen ná i en quetis in aiquen same cáma? An man opólie tare şelmaryanna?”
O man – who, then, are you who answers back to God? Surely that which has been formed will not say to that has formed it: “What is your reason for making me so?”	A atan – man, tá, elye ná ye hanquete nan Erunna? Lau ya anaie canta quetuva yenna acátie sa: “Mana castalya ni-carien sie?”
Or does the potter not have power over the earth to make from the same lump a vessel for a glorious purpose, and another for a purpose that is not glorious?	Hya ma i cemnaro ua same túre or i cén carien i imya umbollo vene alcarinqua ennen, ar exe ennen ya ua alcarinqua?
But suppose that God, though he has the power to show his wrath and to make his power known, with great patience allowed the vessels of wrath to remain, those that are made to be destroyed,	Mal á intya in Eru, ómu samis i túre tanien rúşerya ar carien túrerya sinwa, túra cólenen láve i venin rúşeva lemya, tai yar nar cárine náven nancárine,
in order to make known his abundant glory to the vessels of mercy, that he beforehand prepared for glory –	carien sinwa úvea alcarerya i venin oraviéva, yar nóvo manwanes alcaren
we whom he called not from the Jews alone, but also out of the nations.	– elve i yaldes lá rie i Yúrallon, mal yú et i nórellon.
That is as he says in Hosea: “ that are not my people I will call my people, and who was not beloved, the beloved;	Ta ná ve quetis Hoseasse: “I uar lienya estuvan lienya, ar ye úne melda, i melda;
and in the place where was said to them: 'You are not my people', there they will be called 'sons of the living God'.”	ar i nómesse yasse náne quétina tien: 'Ualde lienya', tasse nauvalte estaine 'i coirea Eruo yondor'.”
For Isaiah cries about Israel: “Though the number of the Children of Israel is like the sand of the sea, only a small remaining part will be saved.	Ar Isaia yame pa Israel: “Ómu Israelindion nóte ná ve earo litse, rie pitya lemyala ranta nauva rehtana.
For the Lord will do an accounting on earth, completing it and cutting it short.”	An i Héru caruva onotie cemende, telyala sa ar nuhtala sa.”
Furthermore, as Isaiah said beforehand: “If the Lord Sebaoth did not allow a seed to remain for us, we became like Sodom, and we were like Gomorrah.”	Ente, ve Isaia quente nóvo: “Au i Héru Sevaot ua láve erde lemya ven, ollelve ve Sorom, ar anelve ve Omorra.”
Then what are we to say? Non-Jews, through they did not pursue righteousness, have found righteousness – the righteousness that comes by faith.	Tá mana quetuvalve? Úyúrar, ómu ualte roitane failie, ihírier failie – i failie ya tule saviénen.
But Israel, though they pursued a law of righteousness, failed to reach the that law.	Mal Israel, ómu roitanelte şanye failiéva, loitaner rahta sana şanyenna.
How so? For the reason that they pursued it, not by faith, but as by deeds. They stumbled by the rock of slipping, as is written: “Behold, I put in Zion a stone of slipping and a rock of falling, but who believes in it will not be humilated.”	Manen sie? I castanen i roitaneltes, lá saviénen, mal ve cardainen. Talantelte i ondonen taltiéva, ve ná técina: “Yé, panyan Sionde sar taltiéva ar ondo lantiéva, mal ye save sasse ua nauva nucumna.”
Brothers, the desire of my heart and my petition for them to God is that they will be saved.	Hánor, endanyo íre ar arcandenya tien Erunna ná i nauvalte rehtane.
For I am a witness to them that they have a burning spirit for God, but not by knowledge.	An nanye astarmo tien i samilte uryala súle Erun, mal lá istyanen.
For since they do not know God's righteousness, but try to establish their own, they did not subject themselves to God's righteousness.	An pan ualte ista Eruo failie, mal nevir tulca véralta, ualte panyane inte nu Eruo failie.
For Christ is the end of the Law, for the purpose that everyone who believes will be pronounced just.	An Hristo i Şanyeo metta ná, i ennen in ilquen ye save nauva quétina faila.
For Moses writes concerning the righteousness that comes by the Law: “The man who has done it will live by it.”	An Móses tece pa i failie ye tule i Şanyenen: “I atan ye acárie sa coituva sánen.”
But the righteousness that comes from believing speaks so: “Do not say in your heart: Who will go up into heaven?” – that is, to bring the Christ down –	Mal i failie ya tule saviello quete sie: “Áva queta endalyasse: Man ortuva mir menel?” – ta ná, talien i Hristo undu –
“or: Who will descend into the abyss?” – that is, to bring Christ up from dead.	“hya: Man untuva mir i undume?” – ta ná, talien Hristo ama qualinallon.
But what does it say? “The word is near to you, in your mouth and in your heart” – that is, the word about the faith, which we make known.	Mal mana sa quete? “I quetta hare lyenna ná, antolyasse ar endalyasse” – ta ná, i quetta pa i savie, ya elme carir sinwa.
For if with your mouth you indicate your belief that Jesus is Lord, and you believe in your heart that God raised him out of dead, you will be saved.	An qui antolyanen teal savielya i Yésus Heru ná, ar savil endalyasse in Eru ortane se et qualinallon, nauval rehtana.
For with the heart one believes, which brings righteousness; by the mouth one indicates what one believes, which brings salvation.	An i endanen mo save, ya tala failie; i antonen mo tea ya mo save, ya tala rehtie.
For the Scripture says: “ who has hope in him will not be humiliated.”	An i Tehtele quete: “Ye same estel sesse lá nauva nucumna.”
For the matter is not one for the Jew and another for the Greek,, but is the same Lord over all, who is rich towards all that call upon him.	An i natto ua er i Yúran ar exe i Hellenyan; mal ea i imya Heru or illi, ye lára ná illin i yalir senna.
For “everyone who calls on the Lord's name will be saved”.	An “ilquen ye yale i Heruo essenen nauva rehtana”.
But how will they call to him in whom they do not believe? And how will they believe in him about whom they have not heard? And how will they hear if they lack anyone that makes known the gospel?	Ono manen yaluvalte senna yesse ualte save? Ar manen savuvalte sesse pa ye ualte ahlárie? Ar manen hlaruvalte qui penilte aiquen ye care sinwa i evandilyon?
And how will they make it known if they are not sent? As is written: “How beautiful are the feel of that bring good news about good things!”	Ar manen caruvaltes sinwa qui ualte mentane? Ve ná técina: “Manen vanime nát i talu ion talar máre sinyar mánaron!”
But all among them did not follow the gospel. For Isaiah says: “Lord, who believed that which people heard from us?”	Mal illi mici te uar hilyane i evandilyon. An Isaia quete: “Héru, man sáve ta ya queni hlasser mello?”
Thus believing comes from that which one hears, and that which one hears comes by the speaking about Christ.	Sie savie tule ho ta ya mo hlare, ar ta ya mo hlare tule i quetiénen pa Hristo.
And yet I ask: Have they indeed not heard? Indeed “into all the earth their sound went forth, and their sayings to the ends of the world.”	Ananta maquetin: Ma é ualte ahlárie? É “mir i quanda cemen lammalta etelende, ar quetieltar mettannar ambaro.”
But I ask: Did Israel not understand? Firstly Moses said: “I cause envy among you by what is not a nation; I cause you to have wrath by an unintelligent nation.”	Mal maquetin: Ma Israel ua hanyane? Minyave Móses quente: “Tyarin hrúcen mici le yanen ua nóre; tyarin le same rúşe úhanda nórenen!”
But Isaiah is very bold and says: “I was found by that did not seek me; I was made known to that did not ask about me.”	Mal Isaia ita canya ná ar quete: “Anen hírina lo i uar ni-cestane; anen carna sinwa in uar maquente pa ni.”
But concering Israel he says: “Through the entire day I have spread out my hands towards a people disobedient and contrary .”	Mal pa Israel quetis: “Ter i quanda aure apantien mányat ana lie canwaracila ar váquetila.”
I ask, then: Surely God has not abandoned his people? By no means! For also I am a man of Israel, of Abraham's seed, of the kin of Benjamin.	Maquetin, tá: Lau Eru hehtane lierya? Laume! An yú inye nér Israélo ná, Avrahámo erdeo, Venyamíno nosseo.
Eru did not reject his people, which beforehand he knew . Do you not know what the Scripture says about Eliah, when he makes petition to God for Israel?	Eru ua hehtane lierya, ya nóvo sintes. Ma ualde ista ya i Tehtele quete pa Elía, íre arcas Erunna Israélen?
“Lord, they have slain your prophets , they have torn down your altars, and I alone remains, and they are seeking my life.”	“Héru, anahtielte tercánolyar, anarcielte undu yangwalyar, ar inye erinqua lemya, ar cestealte cuilenya.”
But what does the Word of God say to him? “I have let seven thousand men remain for me, that have not bent their knee to Baal.”	Mal mana i Eruquetta quete senna? “Alávien nerin húmi otso lemya nin, i uar uluhtayer occalta Vaalen.”
In this manner, therefore, also in this time is a remaining part, by the choice of God's grace.	Mi lé sina, etta, yú lúme sinasse ea lemyala ranta, Erulisseo cilmenen.
If it is grace, it is not by works more; if not, the grace is not more grace.	Qui sa lisse ná, uas ambe cardainen; qui lá, i lisse uas ambe lisse.
What then? which Israel is seeking, that it has not got, but the chosen ones have got it. The perception of the others became blunt,	Mana tá? Ya Israel cestea, ta uas eñétie, mal i cílinar eñétier sa. I exion tuntie olleilaica,
just as has been written: “God has given them a spirit of deep sleep, eyes that do not see and ears that do not hear, until this day.”	aqua ve anaie técina: “Eru ánie tien şúle núra húmeva, hendu yat uat cene ar hlaru yat uat hlare, tenna aure sina.”
Furthermore, David said: “May their table be for them a snare and an entrapping and a reason to fall and a revenge;	Ente, Lavir quente: “Nai sarnolta nauva tien remma ar rembie ar casta lantien ar ahtarie;
may their eyes be made dark for them to fail to see, and always make their back bent!”	nai hendultat oluvat morne loitieltan cene, ar illume cara pontelta cúna!”
Therefore I ask: Did they slip to fall completely? By no means! But by their slipping is salvation for the nations, to cause envy among them.	Etta maquetin: Ma talantelte lantien aqua? Laume! Mal taltieltanen ea rehtie i nórin, tyarien hrúcen mici te.
Now when their slipping brings riches to the world, and their being deprived brings riches to the nations, how much more will their full number do so!	Sí íre taltielta tala almare i marden, ar návelta nehtane tala almare i nórin, manen ita ambe quanta nótelta caruva sie!
Now I am speaking to you, the non-Jews: Being what I am, indeed the apostle of the nations, I praise my ministry ,	Sí quétan lenna, i Úyúrar: Nála ya nanye, é i nórion apostel, laitan núromolienya,
if is a manner by which I can cause envy among that are of my flesh and save some among them.	qui ea lé yanen polin tyare hrúcen imíca i nar hrávenyo ar rehta ennoli mici te.
For if their being thrown away brings reconciliation to the world, what will their being received bring, if not life from the dead?	An qui návelta hátine oa tala rainecarie i marden, mana návelta cámine taluva, qui lá coivie i qualinallon?
Furthermore, if the first portion is hallowed, then the whole dough is holy. And if the root is holy, so are the branches.	Ente, qui i minya massa airinta ná, tá i quanda maxe aire ná. Ar qui i şundo aire ná, sie nar i olvar.
But if some branches were broken off, but you, though you are a wild olive tree, was put into the tree among them and received a part in the fat of the root of the olive tree,	Ono qui olvali náner rácine oa, mal elye, ómu nalye ráva milpialda, náne panyana mir i alda mici tai ar camne ranta i laro i şunduo i milpialdo,
do not praise yourself over the branches! But if you praise yourself over them, recall that you do not carry the root, but the root carries you.	áva laita imle or i olvar! Mal qui laitalyexe or tai, enyala in elye ua cole i şundo, mal i şundo cole lyé.
Then you will say: “Some branches were broken off for me to be put into the tree.”	Tá quetuval: “Olvali náner rácine oa návenyan panyana mir i alda.”
Well: By lack of faith they were broken off, but you stand by faith. Do not have lofty ideas, but fear!	Mai: Peniénen saviéva anelte rácine oa, mal elye tare saviénen. Áva same varande noar, mal ruca!
For if God did not allow the branches that were there by their nature to remain, in the same manner he will not allow you to remain.	An qui Eru ua láve i olvain i náner tasse nasseltanen lemya, mi imya lé uas lavuva elyen lemya.
Behold, then, God's goodness and harshness: Towards that fell is harshness, but towards you is God's goodness, if you remain in his goodness; if not, you all well will be cut off.	Yé, tá, Eruo márie ar naracie: Innar lantaner ea naracie, mal elyenna ea Eruo márie, qui lemyalde márieryasse; qui lá, yú elye nauva aucirna.
They as well, if they do not remain in their lack of faith, will be put into the tree, for God can put them there.	Yú té, qui ualte lemya penieltasse saviéva, nauvar panyane mir i alda, an Eru pole panya te tar.
For if you were cut off from an olive tree which by nature is wild, and contrary to nature you were put into the olive tree in the garden, how much more easy will it be for that by nature have their place there to be put into their own olive tree!	An qui anel hocirna milpialdallo ya nassenen ráva ná, ar ara nasse anel panyana mir i milpialda i tarwasse, manen ita ambe aşcárima nauva in nassenen samir nómelta tasse náve panyane mir véra milpialdalta!
For I do not wish that you, brothers, are to lack knowledge about this secret, to stop you from being wise in your own eyes: is a part of Israel whose perceptions have become blunt until the full time when the fullness of the nations shall come in.	An uan mere in elde, hánor, penuvar istya pa fóle sina, pustien le návello saile mi vére henduldat: Ea ranta Israélo ion tuntier olólier ilaice tenna utúlie i quanta lúme yasse i nórion quantie tuluva minna.
And thus all of Israel shall be saved, as has been written: “The Savior shall come from Zion and will turn away godlessness from Jacob.	Ar sie quanda Israel nauva rehtana, ve anaie técina: “I Rehtando tuluva Sionello ar queruva oa ainolórie Yácovello.
And this is my covenant with them, when I put their sins away.”	Ar si ninya vére ná aselte, íre panyan úcariltar oa.”
Concerning the gospel they are enemies by reason of you, but concerning the choosing they are beloved, by reason of their fathers.	Pa i evandilyon nalte ñottor castanen eldeo, mal pa i cilie nalte melde, castanen atariltaron.
For God's gifts and calling are not things about which he will have second thoughts.	An Eruo annar ar yalie uar nati pa yar samuvas tatye sanwi.
For as you in the past broke God's commands, but now have received mercy by their disobedience ,	An ve elde vanwiesse rancer Eruo canwar, mal sí acámier oravie canwaracieltanen,
so they as well have broken the commands, which caused you to receive mercy, that they as well will receive mercy.	sie yú té sí arácier i canwar, ya tyarne lé came oravie, i yú té sí camuvar oravie.
For God has shut them all up in disobedience, to have mercy on all among them.	An Eru oiórie te illi canwaraciesse, oravien illisse mici te.
Behold how profound are God's riches and wisdom and knowledge are! How unsearchable his judgements, and how impossible to find his paths!	Yé manen tumne Eruo lar ar sailie ar istya nar! Manen alacestime namieryar, ar manen alahírime tieryar!
For “who knew the Lord's mind, and who instucted him?”	An “man sinte i Héruo sáma, hya man peantane issen?”
Or, “Who first gave to him and will receive a payment back?”	Hya, “Man minyave antane sen ar camuva paityale nan?”
For from him and by him and to him are all things! To him be the glory forever! Amen.	An sello ar sénen ar sen nar ilye nati. Issen na i alcar tennoio! Násie.
Therefore I urge you by God's compassion, brothers, that you will give your bodies as a living, holy sacrifice, pleasing to God: a service with your understanding,	Etta hortan le Eruo ofelmenen, hánor, in antauvalde hroaldar ve coirea, aire yanca, fastala Erun: núromolie handaleldanen;
and do not be formed by this age, but be changed by the renewal of your mind, letting you judge what God's will is, the good and pleasing and perfect.	ar áva na cátaine sina randanen, mal na vistaine i envinyatiénen sámaldava, lavila len name mana Eruo indóme ná, i mára ar fastala ar ilvana.
For by the grace given me I tell everyone among you: Do not think about yourself as higher than what it is necessary for you to think, but think in a manner giving health of mind, everyone as God has given him a measure of faith.	An i Erulissenen antana nin nyarin ilquenen mici le: Áva sana pa imle ve tára lá ya mauya lyen sana, mal á sana mi lé antala mále sámo, ilquen ve Eru sen-ánie lesta saviéva.
For as we have in one body many body-parts, but the body-parts do not do the same thing,	An ve samilve er hroasse rimbe hroarantar, mal i hroarantar uar care i imya nat,
so we, though we are numerous, are one body in Christ, but one to one, one another's body-parts.	sie elve, ómu nalve rimbe, nar er hroa Hristosse, mal er ana er, quén i exeo hroarantar.
We have various gifts by the grace given us. For that has a prophecy it is necessary to use it by the measure of faith set aside to him,	Samilve alavéle annali i Erulissenen antana ven. Yen same apacen mauya yuhta sa i lestanen saviéva sátina sen,
to who has a ministry it is necessary to work as a servant, for the teacher it is necessary to teach,	yen same núromolie mauya mole ve núro, i peantaren mauya peanta,
or whose work is to urge, for him it is necessary to urge; for who gives it is necessary to give richly, it ifor that stands before the congregation it is necessary to put his heart in his work; to showing mercy it is necessary to do so in joy!	hya yeo molie hortie ná, sen mauya horta; yen anta mauya anta alyave; yen tare epe i ocombe mauya panya endarya molieryasse; yen órava mauya care sie mi alasse!
 love be real! Abhor what is wicked; stick to what is good.	Melme na anwa! Á feuya ya olca ná; á himya ya mára ná.
 your brotherly love for one another be profound! May everyone show the others a respect greater than he asks for!	Hánomelmelda quén i exeva na tumna! Ilquen na tanuva i exin áya túra lá ya arcas!
Do not be slow, abandoning the urgency; be burning in the spirit, be thralls for the Lord!	Áva na lence, hehtala i horme; na uryala i fairesse, na móli i Herun!
Have joy in the hope! Be steadfast in tribulation! Remain in prayer!	Sama alasse i estelde! Na voronwe şangiesse! Á lemya hyamiesse!
Give a part to the holy ones, as their needs are. Follow the love for strangers!	Á anta ranta i airin, ve maureltar nar. Á hilya i melme etteleaiva!
Bless that persecute – bless and do not curse!	Á aista i roitar – á aista ar áva húta!
Have joy with that have joy; be wailing with the wailing ones.	Sama alasse as i samir alasse; na yaimie as i yaimear.
Be of the same mind, one towards the other; do not wish to be prominent, but be led by the lowly things. Do not become wise in your own eyes! 	Na i imya sámo, quén i exenna; áva mere náve minde, mal na tulyaine lo i nalde nati. Áva ole saile vére henduldatse!
Do not give anyone evil for evil! Bring forward boons before all men.	Áva anta aiquenen ulco ulcun! Á tala ompa mánar epe ilye atani!
If that is possible, keep peace with all men, whenever that is possible for you.	Qui ta cárima ná, hepa raine as ilye atani, quiquie ta ece len.
Do not take revenge for yourselves, but give room for the wrath, for is written: “Revenge is mine, says the Lord; I shall pay back.”	Áva ahtare inden, mal á anta nóme i rúşen, an ná técina: “Ahtarie ninya ná, quete i Héru; inye paityuva nan.”
But “if your enemy is hungry, give him something to eat; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink; for by so doing you gather fiery coals on his head.”	Mal “qui ñottolya maita ná, ásen anta nat matien; qui náse soica, ásen anta nat sucien; an cariénen sie comyal uruiti hyulmali caryasse.”
Do not be mastered by evil, but conquer evil by goodness.	Áva na turúna ulcunen, mal turua ulco mariénen.
May every person subject himself to the higher authorities, for there is not any authority except by God; the authorities that exist have been put there by God.	Nai ilya quén panya immo nu i ambe táre héri, an lá ea hére hequa Erunen; i héri yar ear anaier panyane tasse lo Eru.
Therefore who stands against the authority stands against God's arrangement; the ones that have stood against it will receive judgement in themselves.	Etta ye tare i hérenna tare Eruo partienna; i sanna atárier camuva námie intesse.
For that rule are not a terror to the good deed, but to the evil one. You wish that it will not be necessary for you to fear the authority? Do which is good, and you will receive praise from it,	An i turir uar ruhtie i mára cardan, mal i ulcan. Elye mere i la mauyuva lyen ruce i hérello? Cara ya mára ná, ar camuval laitale sallo,
for it is God's servant for your good. But if you do evil, then fear, for it does not carry the sword without reason. For it is God's agent, an avenging power that brings wrath upon that does evil.	an nas Eruo núro márielyan. Mal qui caril ulco, tá ruca, an uas cole i macil ú casto. An nas Eruo tyaro, ahtarila túre ya tala rúşe yenna care ulco.
Therefore you have need to subject yourselves under the authority, not only by reason of the wrath, but also by reason of your conscience.	Etta samilde maure panien inde nu i hére, lá rie castanen i rúşeo, mal yú castanen immotuntieldo.
For that is also the reason for which you pay taxes, for they are God's servants, ever heeding this purpose.	An ta yú ná i casta yanen paityalde tungwi, an nalte Eruo núror, oi cimila sina enne.
Give to all your debts to them: tax to the one that asks for tax, payment to the one that asks for payment, respect to the one that asks for respect, glory to the one that asks for glory.	Á anta illin rohtaldar tien: tungwe yen arca tungwe, paitie yen arca paitie, áya yen arca áya, alcar yen arca alcar.
Do not have a debt of a single thing to anyone, except to love one another, for who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law.	Áva sama rohta erya natwa aiquenen, hequa mele quén i exe, an ye mele armarorya aquantie i şanye.
For the commandments: “Do not break marriage, Do not kill, Do not be greedy”, and all other commandments, have their sum in this word: “You are to love your neighbor as yourself.”	An i axani: “Ávalye race vestale, Ávalye nahta, Ávalye pile, Ávalye na milca”,ar ilye hyane axani, samir nonwelta quetta sinasse: “Alye mele armarolya ve imle.”
Love does not do evil against neighbor; therefore love is the law made true.	Melme ua care ulco ana i armaro; etta melme i şanye carna nanwa ná.
Furthermore, do so since you know what the time is, that even now has come the time for awakening from sleep, for now our salvation is nearer than what it was when we received faith. Therefore let us put away the deeds that are of darkness and let us put upon ourselves the weapons of light.	Ente, cara sie pan istalde mana i lú ná, i yú sí utúlie i lúme cuivieldan húmello, an sí rehtielva ná hare epe ya anes íre camnelve savie. Etta alve panya oa i cardar yar nar morniéno ar alve panya visse i carmar calava.
As at day, let us behave well, not in wild parties and drunken bouts , not in fornication and loose conduct, not in quarreling or envy.	Ve auresse, alve lenga mai, lá mi verce merendi ar accasucier, lá mi hrupuhtie ar lehta lengie, lá mi costie ar hrúcen.
But put on yourselves the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not make plans for the desires of the flesh.	Mal á panya lesse i Heru Yésus Hristo, ar áva care panor i hráveo írin.
Receive the man that is weak in the faith, but not in order to judge his inner thoughts.	Cama i nér ye ná milya i saviesse, mal lá namien mitye sanweryar.
One person has faith to eat everything, but who is weak eats vegetables.	Er quén same savie matien ilqua, mal ye milya ná mate quear.
 that eats is not to despice that does not eat, for who does not eat is not to judge who eats, for God has received him.	Ye mate áva nattire ye ua mate, ar ye ua mate áva name ye mate, an Eru acámie se.
Who you to judge another's servant? For his own lord he stands or he falls. Indeed he shall stand, for the Lord is able to cause him to stand.	Man elye namien exeo núro? Véra heruryan taris hya lantas. É taruvas, an ece i Herun tyaritas tare.
One person judges one day as greater than another day; another person judges one day like all other days; may everone be wholly firm in his own mind.	Er quén name er ré ve túra lá hyana ré; hyana quén name er ré ve ilye hyane rí; nai ilquen nauva aqua tanca véra sámaryasse.
 who keeps the day, keeps it for the Lord, and who eats, eats for the Lord, since he gives thanks to the Lord; and who does not eat, does not eat for the Lord, and yet he gives thanks to God.	Ye hepe i ré, hepe sa i Herun, ar ye mate, mate i Herun, pan antas hantale Erun; ar ye ua mate, ua mate i Herun, ananta antas hantale Erun.
Indeed nobody among us lives for himself, and nobody dies for himself,	É úquen mici vi coita insen, ar úquen quale insen,
for if we live, we live for the Lord, and if we die, we die for the Lord. Thus, if we live or we if we die alike, we are the Lord's.	an qui coitalve, coitalve i Herun, ar qui qualilve, qualilve i Herun. Sie, qui coitalve hya qui qualilve véla, nalve i Heruo.
And for this purpose Christ died and came back to life: to be Lord of dead ones and of living ones alike.	An sina ennen Hristo qualle ar nanwenne coivienna: náven Heru qualinaron ar coirearon véla.
But you, what is your reason for judging your brother, or what is your reason for despicing your brother? For all among us will stand before God's seat of judgement,	Mal elye, mana castalya namien hánolya, hya mana castalya nattirien hánolya? An illi mici vi taruvar epe Eruo sonda anamo,
for is written: “As I live, says the Lord, to be every knee will bend, and every tongue will praise God.”	an ná técina: “Ve coitan, quete i Héru, ninna ilya occa cuvuva, ar ilya lamba laituva Eru.”
Thus everyone among us will give a reckoning of himself to God.	Sie ilquen mici vi antauva onótie pa inse Erun.
Therefore let us not judge one another, but sooner make this your judgement: do not put thing before a brother that causes him to slip or fall.	Etta ávalve name quén i exe, mal ambe ron cara si namielda: áva panya nat epe háno ya tyare se talta hya lanta.
For I know and have been by the Lord Jesus led to the belief that nothing is defiled in itself, except when a man counts a thing as defiled – to him it is defiled.	An istan ar anaien lo i Heru Yésus tulyana i savienna i munta vahtana ná insasse; hequa íre atan note nat ve vahtana – issen nas vahtana.
For if by food your brother has grief, you no more walk by love. Do not by your food undo the person for whom Christ died!	An qui mattanen hánolya same naire, ualye ambe vanta melmenen. Áva mattalyanen nancare i quén yen Hristo qualle!
Therefore do not let anyone speak about your goodness with scorn.	Etta áva lave aiquenen quete pa márielda yaiwenen.
For God's kingdom is not eating and drinking, but justice and peace and joy by Holy Spirit.	An Eruo aranie ua matie ar sucie, mal failie ar raine ar alasse Aire Feanen.
For who thus is a servant to Christ. pleases God and has been found good by men.	An ye sie núro ná Hriston, fasta Eru ar anaie hirna mane lo atani.
Therefore let us pursue the things that lead to peace and the things that build one another up.	Etta alve roita i nati yar tulyar rainenna ar i nati yar carastar quén i exe ama.
Do not for food tear down what God has made! All things are indeed clean, but they are evil to a man who perceives it as a fall when he eats.	Áva mattan narca undu ya Eru acárie! Ilye nati é nar poice, mal nalte ulce atanen ye tunta sa ve lante íre matis.
 is good not to eat flesh or to drink vine or to do anything that causes your brother to fall.	Mára ná lá matie hráve hya sucie limpe hya carie aiqua ya tyare hánolya lanta.
The faith that you have, keep it between yourself and God. Happy is the person who does not bring judgement upon himself by which he pronounces good .	I savie ya samil, hepa sa imbe lyé ar Eru. Valima ná i quén ye ua tala namie insenna yanen quetis mára.
But if his faith is not firm, he is beforehand judged evil if he eats, for he does not eat out of faith. Indeed everything that is not out of faith is sin.	Mal qui savierya ua tanca, náse nóvo námina ulca qui matis, an uas mate et saviello. É ilqua ya ua et saviello úcare ná.
But the debt of us that are strong is to carry the weak states of that are not strong, and not to please ourselves.	Mal i rohta elveo i nar tulce ná cole i milye sómar ion uar tulce, ar lá fasta inwe.
Let everyone among us please our neighbor, building him up.	Ilquen mici vi na fastuva armaroryo, carastala se ama.
For the Christ as well did not please himself, but as is written: “The harsh words of who spoke harshly to you have fallen upon me.”	An yú i Hristo ua fastane inse, mal ve ná técina: “I narace quettar ion quenter naracave lyenna alantier ninna.”
For all the things written beforehand were written for our instruction, for us to have hope by the steadfastness and by the comfort from the Scriptures.	An ilye i nati técine nóvo náner técine peantielvan, samielvan estel voronwielvanen ar i tiutalénen i Tehtelellon.
Now may God who gives steadfastness and comfort grant you to have the same state of mind among you that Christ Jesus had,	Sí nai Eru ye anta voronwie ar tiutale antauva len same i imya sóma sámo mici le ya Hristo Yésus sáme,
for you to praise with one mouth the God and Father of Jesus Christ our Lord.	laitieldan er antonen Yésus Hristo Herulvo Aino ar Atar.
Therefore receive one another, as the Christ received us, for the glory of God.	Etta cama quén i exe, ve i Hristo camne ví, Eruo alcaren.
For I say that by God's faithfulness the Christ has been a servant to that are circumcised, to make firm the promises to the fathers,	An quetin in Eruo voronwenen i Hristo anaie núro in nar oscírine, carien tance i vandar i atarin,
causing the nations to praise God by reason of his righteousness. As is written: “Therefore I will confess you among the nations, and to your name I will sing!”	tyarila i nóri laita Eru castanen failieryo. Ve ná técina: “Etta etequentuvan lyé imíca i nóri, ar esselyan linduvan!”
And again he says: “Have joy, nations, with his people.”	Ar ata quetis: “Sama alasse, nóri, as lierya.”
And again: “Praise the Lord, all nations, and may all the peoples praise him!”	Ar ata: “Á laita i Héru, ilye nóri, ar nai ilye i lier laituvar se!”
And again Isaiah said: “ will be the root of Jesse, and who rises to rule nations; in him nations will put their hope.”	Ar ata eque Isaia: “Euva Yesseo şundo, ar ye orta turien nóri; sesse nóri panyuvar estelelta.”
May God who gives hope fill all among you with joy and with peace since you believe, for you to have an abundance of hope, by the power of the Holy Spirit.	Nai Eru ye anta estel quantuva illi mici le alassenen ar rainenen pan savilde, samieldan úve estelwa, i Aire Feo túrenen.
Now I as well firmly believe concerning you, my brothers, that you are full of goodness, since you have been filled with all knowledge and know how to instruct one another.	Sí yú inye tulcave save pa lé, hánonyar, in elde nar quante máriéno, pan anaielde quátine ilya istyanen ar istar peanta quén i exe.
But concerning some things I am writing to you in a manner very bold, as if to cause you to remember, by the grace given me from God.	Mal pa natali técan len mi lé ita canya, ve qui tyarien le ata enyale – i lissenen antana nin Erullo.
Thus I will be Jesus Christ's servant for the nations, working as priest for God's gospel, for the purpose that the nations will be a pleasing sacrifice, hallowed by Holy Spirit.	Sie nauvan Yésus Hristo núro i nórin, molila ve airimo Eruo evandilyonen, i ennen in i nóri nauvar fastala yanca, airinta Aire Feanen.
Therefore I may praise myself in Christ Jesus concerning God's things.	Etta lertan laitaxe mi Hristo Yésus pa Eruo nati.
For I do not dare to tell of a single thing except that Christ has done through me, to gain obedience among the nations – by word and by deed	An uan verya nyare pa erya nat hequa yar Hristo acárie ter ní, ñetien canwacimie imíca i nóri – quettanen ar cardanen,
by the power of signs and portents, by the power of Holy Spirit. And thus, from Jerusalem and in a circuit as far as Illyricum, I have made known the whole gospel about the Christ.	i túrenen tanwaron ar tannaron, i túrenen Aire Feo. Ar sie, Yerúsalemello ar rindesse tenna Illiricum, acárien sinwa i quanda evandilyon pa i Hristo.
Thus I indeed make my goal that I will not make known the gospel where Christ's name has been spoken before, to stop myself from bulding on another person's foundation.	Sie é carin ennenya in uan caruva sinwa i evandilyon yasse Hristo esse anaie quétina nóvo, pustien imne carastiello hyana queno talmasse.
But as is written: “The people to whom he was not made known shall see, and that have not heard will understand.”	Mal ve ná técina: “I queni in únes carna sinwa cenuvar, ar i uar ahlárie hanyuvar.”
Therefore I was frequently impeded from coming to you.	Etta anen rimbave tapta tuliello lenna.
But now, since I lack more room in these regions where I can make known the gospel, and since I have longed for many years to come to you,	Mal sí, pan penin amba nóme mi ménar sine yasse polin care sinwa i evandilyon, ar pan imílien ter rimbe loar tule lenna,
I have this hope: that when I go to Spain, it will be possible for me to see you when I pass by, and that you will help me to travel thither when I am in measure filled with your company .	samin estel sina: in íre lelyan Spanianna, ecuva nin vele le íre lahtuvan, ar i manyuvalde ni lelya tar íre nanye mi lesta quátina návenen aselde.
But now I will go to Jerusalem to be a servant to the holy ones.	Mal sí lelyuvan Yerúsalemenna náven núro i airin.
For that are in Macedonia and Achaia thought well to give a part of their goods to the poor ones in Jerusalem.	An i ear Maceroniasse ar Acaiasse sanner mai anta ranta armaltaron i penyain Yerúsalemesse.
To do so was indeed good in their eyes, and yet they were debtors to them, for if the nations have a part in their matters of spirit, they also owe to be servants for them with matters of the flesh.	Care sie é náne mára mi hendulta, ananta anelte rohtandor tien, an qui i nóri samir ranta mi nattoltar faireva, yú rohtalte náve núror tien nattoinen i hráveo.
Therefore, after I complete this and have brought these collected goods to them in safety, I will pass through your area on my journey to Spain.	Etta, apa telyan si ar atálie comyane armar sine téna mi varnasse, autuvan ter vehtelda lendanyasse Spanianna.
But I know that when I come, I shall come having a full measure of blessing from Christ.	Mal istan in íre tulin, tuluvan arwa quanta lesto aistiéva Hristollo.
Now I urge you, brothers, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the spirit, that you do all that you can with me in prayers to God for me,	Sí hortan le, hánor, Herulva Yésus Hristonen ar melmenen i faireo, i carilde ilqua ya polilde óni hyamiessen Erunna inyen,
for me to be delivered from that do not believe in Judea, and that my service in Jerusalem will be to the liking of the holy ones .	návenyan etelehtana illon uar save Yúreasse, ar i núromolienya Yerúsalemesse nauva mára i airin.
Thus, when I come to you with joy, by God's will I will be renewed with you.	Sie, íre tulin lenna arwa alasseo, Eruo indómenen nauvan envinyanta aselde.
May God that gives peace be will all among you! Amen!	Nai i Aino ye anta raine euva as illi mici le! Násie!
I give you Phoebe our sister, who is also a deaconess of the congregation in Cenchreae.	Antan len Foive néşalva, ye ná yú veure i ocombeo mi Cencreai.
Receive her in a manner worthy of the holy ones, and help her in every matter in which she has need of you, for she has protected numerous ones, me as well.	Áse came mi lé valda i airion, ar áse manya mi ilya natto yasse samis maure eldeva, an aváries rimbar, yú ní.
Greet Prisca and Aquila, who have labored with me in Jesus Christ,	Á suila Prisca yo Aquila, yet omóliet óni Yésus Hristosse,
who put their own neck in danger for my life. To the, not I alone but also all the non-Jewish congregations give thanks.	yet panyanet véra axetta raxesse cuilenyan. Tún lá inye erinqua mal yú ilye i Úyúre ocombi antar hantale.
Furthermore, greet the congregation of their house. Greet Epaenetus my beloved, who is a first fruit to Christ in Asia.	Ente, á suila i ocombe coatto. Á suila Epaineto meldanya, ye ná minya yáve Hriston Asiasse.
Greet Mary, who has done numerous things for you.	Á suila María, ye acárie rimbe nati elden.
Greet Andronicus and Junia, who are of my kin and were with me in prison. They have a good name among the apostles, and were in Christ before me.	Á suila Andronico yo Yúnia, yet nát nossenyo ar nánet óni mandosse. Samitte mára esse imíca i aposteli ar nánet Hristosse nó ni.
Greet Ampliatus, my beloved in Christ.	Á suila Ampliáto, meldanya i Hristosse.
Greet Urbanus, who has labored with me in Christ, and Stachys my beloved.	Á suila Urváno, ye omólie óni Hristosse, ar Stacis meldanya.
Greet Apelles, who has been tested in the Lord. Greet the people in the house of Aristobulos.	Á suila Apelles, ye anaie tyastana i Hristosse. Á suila i queni mi coarya Aristovúlo.
Greet Herodion, who is of my kin. Greet the people in the house of Narcissus that are in the Lord.	Á suila Herolion, ye nossenyo ná. Á suila i queni mi coarya Narcisso i nar i Herusse.
Greet Tryphaena and Tryphosa, who toil in the Lord. Greet Persis, the beloved one, for she has done many works in the Lord.	Á suila Trifaina yo Trifósa, yet molit i Herusse. Á suila Persis, i melda, an acáries rimbe mótier i Herusse.
Greet Ruphus, the chosen one in the Lord, and his mother and mine.	Á suila Rúfo, i cílina i Herusse, ar amillerya ar ninya.
Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the brothers with then.	Á suila Asincrito, Flehon, Hermes, Patrovas, Hermas, ar i hánor aselte.
Greet Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the holy ones with them.	Á suila Filolóho ar Yúlia, Nereo ar néşarya, ar Olimpas, ar ilye i airi aselte.
Greet one another with a holy kiss! All of Christ's congregations greet you!	Á suila quén i exe aire miquenen! Ilye Hristo ocombi suilar le!
Now I urge you, brothers, that you will keep your eye on those that cause splits and slippings from the teaching that you received, and turn yourselves away from them.	Sí hortan le, hánor, i hepuvalde hendelda issen tyarir şancier ar taltier i peantiello ya camnelde, ar quera inde oa tello.
For such people are servants, not to Jesus Christ, but to their own bellies, and with fair words and having honey on their tongue they cause to stray the heart of the innocent ones.	An taiti queni nar móli, lá Yésus Hriston, mál vére cumbaltain, ar vanime quettainen ar arwe lisso to lambalta tyarilte ranya i cámalóraron enda.
For your obedience is being noticed by all. Therefore you give me joy. But I wish that you will be wise about that is good, but innocent about what is evil.	An canwacimielda ná tuntaina lo illi. Etta nin-antalde alasse. Mal merin i nauvalde saile pa ya mára ná, mal cámalóre pa ya ulca ná.
The God of Peace will soon crush Satan under your feet . May Jesus our Lord's grace be with you!	I Aino Raineva ron ascatuva Sátan nu taluldat. Nai Yésus Herulvo lisse euva aselde!
Timothy, who labors with me, greets you, and so do Lucius and Jason and Sosipater, that are of my kin.	Timoşéo, ye mole óni, suila len, ar sie carir Lúcio ar Yáson ar Sosípater, i nar nossenyo.
I, Tertius, who has written this letter, greet you in the Lord.	Inye, Tertio, ye etécie tecetta sina, suila le i Herusse.
Gaius, who has received me and the entire congregation into his house, greets you. Erastus, governor of the city, greets you, and so does Quartus his brother. {	Aio, ye acámie ni ar i quanda ocombe mir coarya, suila le. Erasto, i osto cáno, suila le, ar sie care Quarto hánorya. {
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with all among you! Amen!}	Yésus Hristo Herulvo lisse na euva as illi mici le! Násie!}
To the One who can keep you firm by the gospel that I brought and by making known Jesus Christ, by the revelation of the mystery that has been kept in silence for eternities,	Yen pole hepe le tulce i evandilyonnen ya tallen ar cariénen sinwa Yésus Hristo, i apantiénen i fóleva ya anaie hépina quildesse ter oireli,
but now has been shown and made known by the writings of the Prophets among all the nations by the command of the Eternal God, to cause the faith to be heeded	mal sí anaie tanana ar carna sinwa i Erutercánoron tehtelessen mici ilye i nóri Eru Oiro canwanen, tyarien i savie náve címaina
– to God, wise alone, be the glory through Jesus Christ forever. Amen!	– Erun, saila erinqua, na i alcar ter Yésus Hristo tennoio. Násie!
Paul – God's slave and Jesus Christ's apostle, by the faith of God's chosen ones and by the knowledge of the truth that follows from awe of God,	Paulo – Eruo mól ar Yésus Hristo apostel, Eruo cílinaron saviénen ar i istyanen i nanwiéva ya hilya áyallo Eruva,
by the hope of eternal life about which God, who cannot lie, gave a promise before everlasting times,	i estelden i oira coiviéva pa ya Eru, ye ua pole hure, antane vanda nó oialie lúmeli,
though in his own times he revealed his word by making it known, the work for which I was reserved by the command from God who saves us –	ómu vére lúmeryassen apantanes quettarya cariénen sa sinwa, i molie yan inye náne sátina i canwanen Eru Rehtolvallo –
to Titus , real child in the faith that we together have: Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.	Títonna, anwa hína i saviesse ya uo samingwe: Lisse yo raine ho Eru i Atar ar Hristo Yésus Rehtolva.
For this reason I made you remain in Crete , for you to make straight the deficient matters and for you to appoint elders in every city, as I commanded you,	Sina castanen lye-tyarnen lemya Hrétasse, carielyan tére i penye nattor ar satielyan amyárar ilya ostosse, ve cannen lyen:
if there is anyone beyond suspicion, husband of a single wife, having believing children that are not under suspicion of a wild life or rebellious .	qui ea aiquen napsa pella, erya verio veru, arwa savila hínalion i uar nu napsa verca coiviéno hya amortala.
For it is necessary that nobody can speak evil about an overseer as God's steward. It is necessary that he is not a person who pleases himself, not quick to anger or given to wine or one who beats or is greedy for unjust gain,	An mauya in úquen pole quete ulco pa ortirmo ve Eruo mardil. Mauya in uas quén ye fasta inse, lá linta rúşenna hya antaina limpen hya quén ye palpa hya ná milca úfaila ñétien,
but friendly to strangers, a friend of what is good , in health of mind, just, holy, knowing to control himself,	mal nilda etteleain, meldo máriéno, málesse sámo, faila, aire, istala ture inse,
firmly keeping the faithful word of his teaching, so that it is possible for him to urge by the beneficial teaching and also rebuke those that speak against him.	tancave hepila i voronda quetta peantieryasse, ecien sen horta i aşea peantiénen ar yando naitya i quetir ana se.
For there are many unruly people, who speak empty things and seduce the mind, above everything who stick to the circumcision.	An ear rimbe útúrime queni, i quetir cumne nati ar şahtar i sáma, or ilqua i himyar i oscirie.
It is necessary to stop their mouth, for these people subvert entire families by teaching what is not proper, in a desire for unjust gain.	Mauya holta antolta, an queni sine nuquerir quande nossi peantiénen pa ya ua vanima, íresse úfaila ñetiéva.
"One among them, their own prophet, said: ""The Cretans always lie, being wild beasts , unemployed bellies."""	"Quén mici te, véra Erutercánolta, quente: ""I Hrétear illume hurir, nála ulce hravani, úmolila cumbar."""
What he says is true. Therefore rebuke them in a harsh manner, for them to have health in the faith,	Ya quetis nanwa ná. Etta áte naitya mi naraca lé, samieltan mále i saviesse,
not heeding Jewish fables and commands of men who turn themselves away from the truth.	lá címala Yúre nyarier ar axani atanion i querir inte oa i nanwiello.
All things are clean to clean ones, but to people that are defiled and without faith nothing is pure, but their mind and their conscience alike are defiled.	Ilye nati nar poice poicain, mal quenin i nar vahtaine ar ú sáviéno munta poica ná, mal sámalta ar immotuntielta véla nar vahtaine.
They say that they know God, but by their deeds they deny him, since they are disgusting and rebellious, and concerning every good doing they are turned away .	Quetilte in istalte Eru, mal cardaltainen lalalte se, pan nalte yelwe ar amortala, ar pa ilya mára carie nalte quérine oa.
But you, say that are beneficial for healthy teaching.	Mal elye, queta yar nar aşie málea peantien!
It is necessary for the elder men to be lowly in their habits, serious, in health of mind and of faith and of love and of endurance.	Mauya yáre nerin náve nalde haimeltassen, sanwelunge, málesse sámo ar saviéno ar melmeo ar voronwiéno.
In a similar manner, it is necessary for the elder women to behave with respect, not speaking evil about others or being slaves of much wine, teaching what is good,	Mi imya lé, mauya i yáre nissin lenga áyanen, lá quetila ulco pa exi hya nála móli olya limpeo, peantala ya mára ná,
so reminding the young women that it is necessary for them to love their husbands, love their children,	sie rentala i nesse nissi i mauya tien mele verultar, mele hínaltar,
have health of mind, to be pure, working in the house, be good, subjecting themselves to their husbands – to stop anyone from blashpheming God's word.	same mále sámo, náve poice, molila i coasse, nála mani, panyala inte nu verultar – pustien aiquen naiquetiello Eruo quetta.
In the same manner exhort the young men to be sensible,	Mi imya lé á horta i nesse neri náve hande,
in all things showing yourself as an example of good deeds. In your teaching show that you are incorrupt, serious,	mi ilye nati tánala imle ve epemma máre cardaron. Peantielyasse á tana i nalye alahasta, sanwelunga,
speaking beneficial speech which nobody can despise; thus a hostile person will be ashamed, lacking foul thing that he can say about us.	quetila aşea questa ya úquen pole nattire; sie cotya quén nauva naityaina, pénala şaura nat ya polis quete pa vi.
May slaves put themselves under their lords in everything, pleasing them well, not talking back,	Nai móli panyuvar inte nu herultar mi ilqua, fastala te mai, lá nancarpala,
not stealing, but showing good faith, thus adorning the teaching of our Savior, God, in all things.	lá pilila, mal tánala mára savie, sie netyala i peantie Rehtolvo, Eru, mi ilye nati.
For the grace which brings salvation to all men has been revealed,	An i Erulisse ya tala rehtie ilye atanin anaie apantaina,
instructing us to abandon ungodliness and the desires of the world in good health of mind and righteousness and godliness in this age,	peantala ven hehta i Erucotie ar i mardo íri ar mare mi mále sámo ar failie ar Eruáya mi randa sina,
looking forward to the happy hope and the glorious revelation of the mightly God and of our Saviour, Christ Jesus,	yétala ompa i valima estelenna ar i alquarinqua apantie i túra Eruva ar Rehtolvava, Hristo Yésus,
