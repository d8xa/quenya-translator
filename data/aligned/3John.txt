I amyára Aio i meldanna, ye inye mele nanwiesse. 
	2 Melda, hyamin i ilye natissen nalye almárea ar samil mále, tambe fealya almárea ná. 3 An sámen i antúra alasse íre hánoli túler ar *vettaner pa i nanwie ya ea lyesse, ar manen vantal i nanwiesse. 4 Uan same casta hantalen túra lá si: i hlarin i hínanyar vantar i nanwiesse.
	5 Melda, cáral voronda molie ilquasse ya caril i hánoin, yando etteleain, 6 i *evettier pa melmelya epe i ocombe. Iquin, áte menta oa lénen valda Erun. 7 An rá esseryan *etemennelte, lá mápala *aiqua quenillon nórion. 8 Etta mauya ven came taiti queni, i moluvalve uo i nanwien.
	9 Tencen quettali i ocombenna, mal Liotréfes, ye mele náve minda mici te, ua came *aiqua mello. 10 Etta, qui tuluvan, tyaruvanyet enyale cardaryar yar cáras, *cacarpala pa me ulce quettalínen. Ente, pan ta ui fárea sen, yando váquetis came i hánor, ar i merir camitat nevis pusta ar hatitat et i ocombello.
	11 Melda, á care, lá ve ya ulca ná, mal ve ta ya ná mane. Ye care mane Eruo ná. Ye care ulco ua ecénie Eru. 12 Lemetrius same mára *vettie ho illi mici te, ar ho i nanwie imma. É yando elme *vettear, ar istalye i menya *vettie nanwa ná.
13 Sámen rimbe natali tecien lyenna, ananta uan mere tece lyenna móronen ar tecilden. 14 Mal samin i estel i cenuvanyel vérave, ar quetuvangwe cendelello cendelenna. Raine na lyen! I meldor lye-*suilar. Á *suila i meldor, ilya quén essenen.


The elder to Gaius the beloved, whom I love in truth.
	2 Beloved, I pray that in all things you are prosperous and have good health, as your soul is prosperous. 3 For I had the greatest joy when some brothers came and witnessed about the truth that is in you, and how you walk in the truth. 4 I do not have [any] reason for thanksgiving greater than this: that I hear that my children walk in the truth.
	5 Beloved, you are doing a faithful work in everything that you do for the brothers, also for strangers, 6 who have witnessed about your love before the congregation. Please, send them away in a manner worthy of [/to, for] God. 7 For on behalf of his name they went forth, not taking anything from people of [the] nations. 8 Therefore we must receive such people, that we will work together for the truth.
	9 I wrote some words to the congregation, but Diotrephes, who loves being prominent among them, does not receive anything from us. 10 Therefore, if I will come, I will make them remember his deeds that he is doing, chattering about us with evil words. Moreover, since that is not enough for him, he also refuses to receive the brothers, and [those] who want to receive them he tries to stop and to throw them out of the congregation.
	11 Beloved, do, not according to what is evil, but according to that which is good. [He] who does good is of God. [He] who does evil has not seen God. 12 Demetrius has a good witness from all among them, and from the truth itself. Indeed also we are bearing witness, ar you know that our witness is true.
	13 I had many things to write to you [sg], and yet I do not want to write to you with ink and with pen. [Instrumental tecil-nen > tecilden.] 14 But I have the hope that I will see you personally, and we [-ngwe, dual] will speak face to face. Peace be to you! The friends greet you. Greet the friends, each one by name.
